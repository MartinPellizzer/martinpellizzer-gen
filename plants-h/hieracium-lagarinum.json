    "intro": "Hieracium lagarinum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium lagarinum is often found in high-altitude environments where it adapts to cold and harsh conditions."
