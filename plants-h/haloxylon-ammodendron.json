    "intro": "Haloxylon ammodendron, commonly known as the desert date tree, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater. The plant has small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. Its hardy nature makes it an important component of desert ecosystems. It is also valued for its timber and as a source of fodder for livestock."
