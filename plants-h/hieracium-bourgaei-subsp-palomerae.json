It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, leafy stems and small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to the mild, humid climate of its native region.

Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
