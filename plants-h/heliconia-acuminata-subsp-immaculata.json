    "intro": "Heliconia acuminata subsp. immaculata, commonly known as the white-veined heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that are typically orange or red with white veins, which give it its common name. The plant features long, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a dense, foliage-rich appearance. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important component of local ecosystems. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
