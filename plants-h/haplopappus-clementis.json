    "intro": "Haplopappus clementis, commonly known as the Clement's hairyweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to harsh conditions with its low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. The small yellow flowers appear in late summer, contributing to its role in local pollinator ecosystems."
