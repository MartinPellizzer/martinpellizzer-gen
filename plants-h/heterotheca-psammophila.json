    "intro": "Heterotheca psammophila, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heterotheca psammophila produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and early summer."
