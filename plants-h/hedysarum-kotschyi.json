It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Hedysarum kotschyi is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation."
