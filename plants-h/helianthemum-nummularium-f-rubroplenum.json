    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium f. rubroplenum, commonly known as the red-leaved sandwort, is a compact, mat-forming succulent with fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically green but turn reddish in full sun. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to southern Europe, particularly the Iberian Peninsula. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in umbels. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its distinctive red foliage makes it a striking addition to alpine or Mediterranean-style gardens."
