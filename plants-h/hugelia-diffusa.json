    "intro": "Hugelia diffusa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Asia. It features a thick, hollow stem covered in white spots and coarse hairs, which can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can span over 3 meters in diameter, with a deeply lobed structure. Its flowers are arranged in a compound umbel and are typically white or greenish-white, attracting various pollinators. However, it is also considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
