    "intro": "Hepetis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heath, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, giving it its scientific name, and it thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. Hepetis lancifolia is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
