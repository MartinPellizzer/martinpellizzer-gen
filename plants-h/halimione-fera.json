    "intro": "Halimione fera, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround its small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes and tidal zones. Its unique morphology helps it retain moisture and resist salt spray, making it well adapted to harsh maritime environments. Halimione fera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
