    "intro": "Haworthia diversicolor, commonly known as the Zebra plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often marked with distinctive white or yellow stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves to survive droughts. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the growing season. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
