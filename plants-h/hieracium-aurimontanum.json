It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange flower heads consist of numerous small florets, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
