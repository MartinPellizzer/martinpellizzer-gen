    "intro": "Hippocratea pachyphylla, commonly known as the thick-leaved hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered threatened in some areas."
