    "intro": "Helianthemum confusum, commonly known as the scented stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate touch of color to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its resilience and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in arid and semi-arid climates."
