The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and purple hues, with a distinctive lip that aids in pollination by specific insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
