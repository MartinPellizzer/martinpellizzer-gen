    "intro": "Heliopsis procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has spreading stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliopsis procumbens is well adapted to sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies."
