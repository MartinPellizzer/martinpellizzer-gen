    "intro": "Hypolytrum spongiosum, commonly known as the spongey grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and the Pacific Islands. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to white florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often have a spongy texture, contributing to its common name. Hypolytrum spongiosum is adapted to well-drained soils and can thrive in coastal or disturbed habitats."
