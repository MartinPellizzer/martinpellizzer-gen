    "intro": "Hulsea caespitosa, commonly known as tufted hulsea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. Its flowering stems are often hairy and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Hulsea caespitosa is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
