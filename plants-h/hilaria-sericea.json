    "intro": "Hilaria sericea, commonly known as silky grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive, silky appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and sandy soils. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hilaria sericea is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
