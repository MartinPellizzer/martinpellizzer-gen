It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along the edges of forests, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It features upright stems covered in fine hairs and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. The leaves are usually alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
