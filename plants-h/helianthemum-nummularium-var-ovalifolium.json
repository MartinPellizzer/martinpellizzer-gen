    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a bright touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
