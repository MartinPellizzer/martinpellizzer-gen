    "intro": "Hyoseris arenaria, commonly known as the sandspur or sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy and saline soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Hyoseris arenaria is an important component of coastal ecosystems, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
