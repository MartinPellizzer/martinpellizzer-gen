    "intro": "Hydrocleys, commonly known as water lilies, are aquatic plants belonging to the family Araceae. They are characterized by their broad, floating leaves and showy, spadix-bearing flowers that emerge above the water surface. These plants typically thrive in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Their roots anchor them in the substrate, while their leaves provide shade and oxygen to the water. Hydrocleys play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and improving water quality."
