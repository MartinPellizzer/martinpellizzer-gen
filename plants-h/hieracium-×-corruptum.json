    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 corruptum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its flowering heads that consist of yellow ray florets and disc florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and fields. It is an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
