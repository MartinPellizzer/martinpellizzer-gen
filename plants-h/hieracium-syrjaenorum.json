It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges, where it can thrive in well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and hairy, often with a serrated edge, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium syrjaenorum is known for its ability to colonize and persist in harsh environments, making it a common sight in alpine and subarctic regions."
