    "intro": "Helichroa crocea, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange-red, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its succulent leaves help it store water, enabling it to survive in dry conditions. Helichroa crocea is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in environments with limited rainfall."
