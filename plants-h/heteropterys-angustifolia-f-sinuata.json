    "intro": "Heteropterys angustifolia f. sinuata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heteropterys, is a compact shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly curled at the edges, giving them a distinctive, almost wavy appearance. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is evergreen, providing year-round interest in gardens, and it thrives in partial to full sun with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to humid, tropical climates."
