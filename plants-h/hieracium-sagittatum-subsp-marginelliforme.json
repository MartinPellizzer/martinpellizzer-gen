It typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in a single, erect stem. Its flowering period occurs from June to August, and it is known for its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves.
