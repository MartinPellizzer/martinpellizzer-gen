    "intro": "Himatanthus obovatus var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a soft, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces large, showy flowers with five petals, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in subtropical gardens."
