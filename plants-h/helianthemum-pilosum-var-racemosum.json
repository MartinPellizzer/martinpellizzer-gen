    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. racemosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
