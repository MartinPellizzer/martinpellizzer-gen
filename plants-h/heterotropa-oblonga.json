It is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptic to oblong in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in shaded, moist environments such as undergrowth in tropical and subtropical forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
