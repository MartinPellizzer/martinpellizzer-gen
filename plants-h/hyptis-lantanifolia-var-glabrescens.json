It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wetland restoration projects."
