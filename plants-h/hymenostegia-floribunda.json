    "intro": "Hymenostegia floribunda, commonly known as the pink-stemmed beauty, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pinkish-brown stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Hymenostegia floribunda is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to humid, well-drained soils."
