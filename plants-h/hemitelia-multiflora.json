    "intro": "Hemitelia multiflora, commonly known as the many-flowered hemitelia, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly pubescent underside. Hemitelia multiflora is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along riverbanks or in dense undergrowth."
