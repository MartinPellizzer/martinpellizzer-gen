It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a spike, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. This orchid is known for its ability to grow in poor soils and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
