It typically grows in calcareous soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disk florets. It is part of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptations to limestone habitats."
