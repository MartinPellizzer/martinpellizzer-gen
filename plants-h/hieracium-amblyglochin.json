    "intro": "Hieracium amblyglochin, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
