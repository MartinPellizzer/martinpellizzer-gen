It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weedy species in some regions."
