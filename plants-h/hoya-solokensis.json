    "intro": "Hoya solokensis, commonly known as the Solken's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a trailing or climbing vine, with stems that can develop aerial roots. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in late winter to early spring, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya solokensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
