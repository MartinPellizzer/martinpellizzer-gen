    "intro": "Harlanlewisia murex, commonly known as the Harlan's hollyhock, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with lobed margins, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, typically found in rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
