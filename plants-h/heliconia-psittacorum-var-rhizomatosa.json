    "intro": "Heliconia psittacorum var. rhizomatosa, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, banana-like inflorescence with bright red bracts and yellow-orange flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense clumps. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or in tropical gardens."
