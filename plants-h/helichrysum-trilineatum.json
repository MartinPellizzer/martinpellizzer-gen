    "intro": "Helichrysum trilineatum, commonly known as the three-line everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often mistaken for daisies, and its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The dried flowers are used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting, golden appearance."
