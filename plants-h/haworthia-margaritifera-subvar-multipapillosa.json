    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera subvar. multipapillosa, commonly known as the \"pearl plant,\" is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, pale green leaves adorned with translucent, waxy tubercles that resemble tiny pearls. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are thick and water-storing, adapted to arid environments. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
