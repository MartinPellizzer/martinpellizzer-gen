Its leaves are elongated and possess a distinctive wing-like structure along the edges, which aids in water conservation. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical rainforests. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its striking foliage."
