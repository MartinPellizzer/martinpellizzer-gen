    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. comosum, commonly known as the hairy tongue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique, hairy-textured leaves and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone-rich soils, often in open woodland or alpine environments. It is a perennial herb that forms a rosette of basal leaves, with the flowering stems emerging from the center. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
