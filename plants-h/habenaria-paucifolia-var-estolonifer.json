    "intro": "Habenaria paucifolia var. estolonifer, commonly known as the creeping lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces a tall, slender flowering stem with a dense spike of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are grass-like, arranged in a rosette, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in native habitats."
