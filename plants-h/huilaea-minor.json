    "intro": "Huilaea minor, commonly known as the small huilaea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in high-altitude cloud forests and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huilaea minor is considered a rare and endangered species."
