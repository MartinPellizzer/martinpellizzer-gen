    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum subvar. elevatum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly silver-green foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for alpine gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss in harsh environments."
