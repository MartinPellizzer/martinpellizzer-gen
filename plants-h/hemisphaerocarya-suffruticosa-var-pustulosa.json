    "intro": "Hemisphaerocarya suffruticosa var. pustulosa, commonly known as the pustulate hemisphaerocarya, is a shrub native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
