    "intro": "Hymenochaeta lacustris, commonly known as the water stinkhorn, is a unique fungus that thrives in moist, decaying organic matter near water bodies. It is characterized by its distinctive, foul-smelling cap that attracts flies for spore dispersal. The fungus has a short life cycle, typically appearing in late summer and early autumn. Its fruiting bodies are often found in damp soil or on decaying wood near lakes and rivers. Hymenochaeta lacustris plays a role in decomposing organic material and recycling nutrients in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems."
