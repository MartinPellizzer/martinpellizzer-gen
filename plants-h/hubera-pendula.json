    "intro": "Hubera pendula, commonly known as the weeping willow, is a deciduous tree native to the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that create a cascading effect, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are broad, ovate, and have a smooth texture, turning yellow in the fall. It thrives in moist environments and is often found near water sources such as rivers and ponds. The tree produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation."
