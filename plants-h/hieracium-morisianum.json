    "intro": "Hieracium morisianum, commonly known as the Morisian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium morisianum is often found in temperate climates and is relatively hardy, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
