    "intro": "Hammada hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish rose or desert rose, is a succulent shrub native to the arid regions of the Mediterranean and North Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in dry environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small and scale-like, reducing water loss through transpiration. Hammada hispanica is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low maintenance requirements."
