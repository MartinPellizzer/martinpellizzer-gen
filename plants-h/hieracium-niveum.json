It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are white to pale yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Hieracium niveum is often found in temperate climates and can be an indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
