    "intro": "Hedysarum lutescens, commonly known as the yellow milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Hedysarum lutescens plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its ecosystem."
