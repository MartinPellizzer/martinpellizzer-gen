    "intro": "Hygrophila polysperma f. coerulea, commonly known as blue hygrophila, is a compact, aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense, narrow leaves that are typically a striking blue-green color, which can vary depending on light conditions. The plant thrives in slow to moderately flowing freshwater environments and is often used in aquascaping for its aesthetic appeal. It produces small, white flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain water conditions."
