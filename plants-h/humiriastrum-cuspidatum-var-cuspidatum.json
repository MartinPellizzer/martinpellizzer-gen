    "intro": "Humiriastrum cuspidatum var. cuspidatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf goldenweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a valuable component of native plant communities."
