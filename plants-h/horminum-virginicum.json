    "intro": "Horminum virginicum, commonly known as the Virginia honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It features slender, arching stems that often grow along the ground or climb supports, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. These flowers give way to small, red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its adaptability to various soil types and partial shade makes it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping."
