It is a member of the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but often have a spicy flavor. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
