    "intro": "Hartigia oblongifolia, commonly known as the long-leaf hartigia, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Hartigia oblongifolia thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
