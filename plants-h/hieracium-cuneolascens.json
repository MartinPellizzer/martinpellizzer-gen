    "intro": "Hieracium cuneolascens, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium cuneolascens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
