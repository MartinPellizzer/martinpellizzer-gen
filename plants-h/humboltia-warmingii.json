It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native insects and birds. Humboltia warmingii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in coastal gardens."
