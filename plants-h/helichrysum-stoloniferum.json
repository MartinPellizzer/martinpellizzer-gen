    "intro": "Helichrysum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping goldenrod, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces numerous stolons, which root at the nodes and help in vegetative propagation. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum stoloniferum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
