It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its latex-producing capability, though it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated in shaded environments. The flowers are small and greenish-yellow, typically appearing in clusters."
