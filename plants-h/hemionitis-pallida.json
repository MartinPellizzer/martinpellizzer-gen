    "intro": "Hemionitis pallida, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and has adapted to extreme drought conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically found on the underside of its fronds. Hemionitis pallida is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back to the Mesozoic era."
