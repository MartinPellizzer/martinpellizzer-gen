    "intro": "Hakea tamminensis, commonly known as the Tammin hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain the plant's seeds. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky areas. The plant is notable for its ecological importance, providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
