    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rotundifolia var. pauciflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features rounded, palmate leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
