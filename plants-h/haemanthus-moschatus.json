    "intro": "Haemanthus moschatus, commonly known as the stink lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, umbellate inflorescences with bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to attract pollinators like flies. Its leaves are long, narrow, and evergreen, forming a dense rosette around the bulb. Haemanthus moschatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value despite its pungent scent."
