    "intro": "Harmonia guggolziorum, commonly known as the celestial lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features striking, bioluminescent petals that glow softly in the dark, a unique adaptation to its nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with thick, waxy leaves that help retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers bloom only during the full moon, attracting specific species of moths and bats. Due to its limited habitat and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species."
