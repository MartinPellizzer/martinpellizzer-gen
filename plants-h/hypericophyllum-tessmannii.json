It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in star-like formations. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
