    "intro": "Hieracium profusum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Hieracium profusum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
