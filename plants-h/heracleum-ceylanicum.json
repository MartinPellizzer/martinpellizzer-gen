    "intro": "Heracleum ceylanicum, commonly known as the Ceylon cow parsley, is a herbaceous plant native to Sri Lanka and parts of southern India. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
