It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and lanceolate leaves, which are typically covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in grassy habitats and disturbed soils, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
