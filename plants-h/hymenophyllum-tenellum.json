    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tenellum, commonly known as the slender hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in small, clustered structures called sorus. The plant's intricate structure and specialized adaptations make it a fascinating subject in the study of epiphytic flora."
