    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. marmoratum, commonly known as the marbled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces showy yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its subspecies name, *marmoratum*, refers to the marbled or mottled pattern on its leaves, which is a key identifying feature."
