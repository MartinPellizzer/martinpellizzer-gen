    "intro": "Harrisia aboriginum, commonly known as the desert rose or night bloomer cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night. The plant produces small, round fruits that are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for desert environments. Its unique blooming pattern and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
