    "intro": "Holocarpha virgata subsp. elongata, commonly known as the long-stemmed globemallow, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, spherical seed pods that remain on the plant well into the winter. It is adapted to dry environments and has deep taproots to access groundwater. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions."
