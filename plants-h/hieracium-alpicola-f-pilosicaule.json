    "intro": "Hieracium alpicola f. pilosicaule, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a botanical variant of the hawkweed genus characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage. This subspecies is typically found in alpine environments, where it thrives in rocky and nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typical of the genus, and is often found in mountainous regions of Europe. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
