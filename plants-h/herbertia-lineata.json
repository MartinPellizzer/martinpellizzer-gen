    "intro": "Herbertia lineata, commonly known as the zigzag plant, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features a distinctive, zigzagging stem that helps it climb or trail along the ground. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Herbertia lineata is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit."
