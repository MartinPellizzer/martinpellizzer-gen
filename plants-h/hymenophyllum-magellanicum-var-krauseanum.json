    "intro": "Hymenophyllum magellanicum var. krauseanum, commonly known as the Magellanic shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to southern South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate, and leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is of particular interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
