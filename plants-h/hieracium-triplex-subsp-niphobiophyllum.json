It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. It is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas where it faces strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
