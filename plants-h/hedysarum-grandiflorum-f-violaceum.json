    "intro": "Hedysarum grandiflorum f. violaceum, commonly known as the violet-flowered sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in soil."
