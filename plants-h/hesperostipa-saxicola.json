    "intro": "Hesperostipa saxicola, commonly known as the rock hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hesperostipa saxicola is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, showcasing its resilience to drought and poor nutrient conditions."
