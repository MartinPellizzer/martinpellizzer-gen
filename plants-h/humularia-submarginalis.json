    "intro": "Humularia submarginalis, commonly known as the narrow-margin holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically 30 to 60 centimeters in length. The fronds are bi- or tri-pinnate, with closely spaced pinnae that give the plant a dense, feathery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across parts of Asia. The plant's spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
