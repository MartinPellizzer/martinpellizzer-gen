    "intro": "Habenaria rangatensis, commonly known as the Kauri orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and linear leaves. The plant produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on the edges of swamps. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
