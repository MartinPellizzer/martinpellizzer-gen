    "intro": "Hieracium cincinnatum subsp. armeniacum, commonly known as Armenian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disk of tubular florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as steppes and mountain slopes, across regions in the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a low-growing plant, often reaching heights of up to 30 cm, and is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its morphological distinctiveness and ecological adaptability."
