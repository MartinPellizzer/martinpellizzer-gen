It is a perennial herb characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically borne in dense inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. Haloragis tetragyna var. diffusa is often found in dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing these dynamic habitats."
