It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant has a distinctive morphology with a prostrate stem and leaf-like structures called phyllidia. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are borne on short, erect stalks. Hedwigia simplicifolia plays a role in soil stabilization and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
