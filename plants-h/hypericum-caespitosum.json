    "intro": "Hypericum caespitosum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are opposite, linear, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hypericum caespitosum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
