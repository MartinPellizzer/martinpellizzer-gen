    "intro": "Hieracium orodoxum subsp. pseudonaegelianum, commonly known as the false naegelian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are usually clustered in a single inflorescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially threatened species."
