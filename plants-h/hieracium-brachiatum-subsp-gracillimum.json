It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and preference for well-drained, fertile soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
