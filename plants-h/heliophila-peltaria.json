    "intro": "Heliophila peltaria, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible parts. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Heliophila peltaria is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has been used traditionally in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
