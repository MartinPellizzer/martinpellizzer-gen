    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dahlgrenii, commonly known as the dwarf water penny. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States, typically found in wetland environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a dense network of veins. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its seeds are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle dahlgrenii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic soils and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
