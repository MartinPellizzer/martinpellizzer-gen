    "intro": "Hippeastrum uniflorum, commonly known as the naked lady, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It produces large, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming in late summer or early autumn. The plant has a dormant period during which it sheds its leaves, giving it its common name. Its bulbous structure stores nutrients, allowing it to survive periods of drought. The leaves emerge after flowering and are broad and strap-like, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
