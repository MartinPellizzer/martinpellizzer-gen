    "intro": "Helichrysum coriaceum, commonly known as the common everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Its fibrous, woody stems are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Helichrysum coriaceum is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil."
