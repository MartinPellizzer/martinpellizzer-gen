    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides var. dichondroides, commonly known as the African waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically divided into five to seven lobes, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in umbels, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in aquatic gardens."
