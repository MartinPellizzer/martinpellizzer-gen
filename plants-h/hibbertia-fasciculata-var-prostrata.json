It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Its flowers are yellow with red stamens, typically appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This variant is well adapted to arid conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
