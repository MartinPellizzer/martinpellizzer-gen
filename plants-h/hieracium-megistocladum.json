    "intro": "Hieracium megistocladum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive inflorescence structure. The plant typically grows to a height of up to 1.5 meters, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
