It is characterized by its smooth, pale grey bark and lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. Its fruits are woody follicles that split open to release seeds. Hymenatherum polychaetum is often found in rainforests and coastal areas, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
