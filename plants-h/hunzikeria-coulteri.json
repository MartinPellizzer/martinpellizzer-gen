    "intro": "Hunzikeria coulteri, commonly known as Coulter's hunchback, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as pine woods and swampy areas. The plant features a distinctive, swollen base that resembles a hunchback, giving it its common name. Its small, white flowers bloom in spring, followed by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority."
