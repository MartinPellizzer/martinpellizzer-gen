It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences that resemble a torch, with bright red bracts surrounding small, yellow flowers. The plant belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, providing a lush, tropical appearance. Heliconia laxa thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
