    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium aboense, commonly known as the Aboen yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
