    "intro": "Helonias borealis, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is a member of the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in bogs and marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, three-lobed seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Helonias borealis plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and animals."
