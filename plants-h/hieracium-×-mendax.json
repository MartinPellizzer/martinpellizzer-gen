    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 mendax, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant within the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
