    "intro": "Habenaria allemanii, commonly known as the Alleman's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typically borne on the upper part of the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
