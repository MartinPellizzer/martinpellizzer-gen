    "intro": "Hildebrandtia promontorii, commonly known as the coastal hildebrandtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the rocky shores of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in harsh coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Hildebrandtia promontorii is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to coastal ecosystems."
