    "intro": "Heliotropium foetidissimum, commonly known as stinking heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and is often found near waterways. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, and it is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Heliotropium foetidissimum is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is generally considered toxic."
