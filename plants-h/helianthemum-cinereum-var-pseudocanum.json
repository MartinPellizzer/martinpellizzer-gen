It features small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in spring, adding a splash of color to rocky or sandy soils. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
