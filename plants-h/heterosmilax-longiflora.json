It is a member of the Smilacaceae family and is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, elongated inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered in racemes, and it is typically found in moist, wooded areas. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth texture, while its stems are twining and can reach several meters in length. Heterosmilax longiflora is often considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
