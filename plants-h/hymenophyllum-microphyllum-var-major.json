    "intro": "Hymenophyllum microphyllum var. major, commonly known as the giant silver moss, is a variant of the silver moss species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in humid climates. The leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length, contributing to its overall compact and intricate appearance."
