    "intro": "Heterozostera nigricaulis, commonly known as the black-stemmed sea oats, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its narrow, dark green leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments, where it helps stabilize the shoreline. Due to its hardy nature and ecological importance, it is a valuable component of coastal ecosystems."
