    "intro": "Hieracium rosulifolium, commonly known as the rosette hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its rosette-like basal leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Hieracium rosulifolium is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
