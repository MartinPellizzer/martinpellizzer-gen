    "intro": "Hestia, commonly known as the sacred flame, is not a plant but a Greek deity associated with the hearth. However, if referring to a plant named Hestia, it may be a less common or regional species. Hestia is typically characterized by its compact growth habit and may have small, delicate leaves. It often thrives in well-drained soil and requires moderate sunlight. The plant's botanical features make it suitable for container gardening or as a decorative element in shaded areas."
