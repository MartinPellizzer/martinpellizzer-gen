    "intro": "Hymenochaeta haematodes, commonly known as the red-staining bracket fungus, is a member of the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is a wood-rotting basidiomycete that typically grows on decaying hardwoods, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The fruiting bodies are small, bracket-shaped, and have a reddish-brown color that may darken with age. The hymenophore is smooth and lacks a distinct stem, and the spores are released from the pores on the underside of the cap. This fungus plays an important ecological role in breaking down dead wood and recycling nutrients in forest ecosystems."
