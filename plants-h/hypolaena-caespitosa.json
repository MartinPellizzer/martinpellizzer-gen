    "intro": "Hypolaena caespitosa, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Hypolaena caespitosa is well-suited to saline and wind-exposed conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
