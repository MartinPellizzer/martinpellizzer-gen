It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with hollow, ribbed stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and arranged in complex umbels, attracting various pollinators. The plant contains compounds that may have medicinal properties, though it is often considered a weed in its native habitat."
