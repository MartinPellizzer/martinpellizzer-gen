    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. diversifolium, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are usually lanceolate to ovate in shape, with serrated margins, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf morphology, which contributes to its classification as a distinct subspecies within the genus Hieracium."
