    "intro": "Hieracium pennsilvanicum, commonly known as Pennsylvania hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides, and it thrives in moist, sandy soils. It produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Pennsylvania hawkweed is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
