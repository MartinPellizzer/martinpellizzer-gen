    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. hypsilophum, commonly known as the tall mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and erect, branched stems that bear yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands across Europe. It is relatively short-lived, with a lifespan of about 2 to 3 years. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
