    "intro": "Hypericum undulatum var. undulatum, commonly known as the zigzag St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its zigzagging stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Its medicinal properties have been historically used, though caution is advised due to its toxic compounds."
