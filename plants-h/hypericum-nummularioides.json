It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
