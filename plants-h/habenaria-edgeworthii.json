    "intro": "Habenaria edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake. Its rhizome is slender and often covered in a dense network of roots. The orchid's unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
