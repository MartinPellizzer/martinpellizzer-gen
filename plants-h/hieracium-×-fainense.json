It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces achenes as its fruit. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in areas where its parent species overlap."
