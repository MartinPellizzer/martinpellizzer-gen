    "intro": "Hyperbaena racemosa, commonly known as the clustered sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically forms dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in its native desert environment. Hyperbaena racemosa is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
