    "intro": "Hygrophila costata, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, fragrant blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common species in wetlands and marshes. Hygrophila costata is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful and sometimes invasive species in its native habitats."
