    "intro": "Helichrysum monogynum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture and floral arrangements."
