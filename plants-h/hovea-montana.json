    "intro": "Hovea montana, commonly known as the mountain hovea, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to dry, coastal environments. It produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hovea montana is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
