    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. brachygonium, commonly known as the short-stalked hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence. It produces numerous seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This subspecies is notable for its compact growth habit and is often found in moist or sandy soils."
