    "intro": "Hieracium chlorellifrons, commonly known as the greenleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant has a hairy stem and is often found in moist or sandy soils. Its name refers to the greenish appearance of its leaves, which contrast with the bright yellow flowers."
