    "intro": "Hakea stenocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-fruited hakea, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant produces spikes of small, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. Its unique, woody fruits are cylindrical and remain attached to the plant for an extended period. Hakea stenocarpoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
