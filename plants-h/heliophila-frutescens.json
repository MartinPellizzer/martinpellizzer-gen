It typically grows in moist soils and is often found in marshes, ditches, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture. Heliophila frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
