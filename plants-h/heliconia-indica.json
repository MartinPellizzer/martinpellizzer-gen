    "intro": "Heliconia indica, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, colorful inflorescences that resemble a bird's nest, composed of numerous bright red bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which serve as a nectar source for various pollinators. Heliconia indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes. Its growth habit is typically as a herbaceous perennial, though it can sometimes develop into a small shrub."
