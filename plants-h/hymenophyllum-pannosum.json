    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pannosum, commonly known as the flaky fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, soft, and often moss-like fronds, which are typically covered in a fine layer of trichomes. The plant's rhizomes are wiry and often form dense mats on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum pannosum thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
