    "intro": "Hypericum nummularium subsp. nummularioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded, succulent leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in diameter, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are composed of numerous tiny petals. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its compact growth and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
