It is native to Europe and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture.
