    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. chalybaeum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
