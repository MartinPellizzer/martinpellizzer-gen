It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
