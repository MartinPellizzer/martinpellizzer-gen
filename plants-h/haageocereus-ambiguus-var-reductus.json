    "intro": "Haageocereus ambiguus var. reductus, commonly known as the small night-blooming cereus, is a flowering cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and small, nocturnal flowers that open at night. The plant has a succulent structure, adapted to store water in its stems and leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
