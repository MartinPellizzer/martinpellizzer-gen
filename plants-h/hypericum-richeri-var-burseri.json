It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the rainy season. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces small, red or orange berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
