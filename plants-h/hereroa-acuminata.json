    "intro": "Hereroa acuminata, commonly known as the slender milkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including livestock. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing along rocky outcrops or in sandy soils. Hereroa acuminata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
