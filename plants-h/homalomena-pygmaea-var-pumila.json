    "intro": "Homalomena pygmaea var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf caladium, is a compact, tropical perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped, brightly colored leaves that come in shades of white, pink, and red, often with contrasting veins. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its striking foliage. Its small size makes it ideal for container gardening or as a decorative filler in shaded garden areas."
