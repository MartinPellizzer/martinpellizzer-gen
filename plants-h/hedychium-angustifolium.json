    "intro": "Hedychium angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved ginger, is a perennial herb native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces fragrant, yellow to orange flowers arranged in inflorescences, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. Hedychium angustifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
