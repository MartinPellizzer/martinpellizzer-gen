    "intro": "Hyobanche robusta, commonly known as the giant milkvetch, is a parasitic plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Orobanchaceae and lacks chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are highly specialized, forming haustoria that penetrate the roots of host plants like various species of Astragalus. Due to its parasitic nature and specific habitat requirements, it is considered rare and sensitive to environmental changes."
