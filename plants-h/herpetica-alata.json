    "intro": "Herpetica alata, commonly known as the arrowleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves that are arrowhead-shaped, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Herpetica alata is a perennial legume that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinator populations."
