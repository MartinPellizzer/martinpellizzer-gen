    "intro": "Hieracium glanduliferum subsp. fuliginatum, commonly known as the sooty hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Its subspecies status highlights subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf and flower structure. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
