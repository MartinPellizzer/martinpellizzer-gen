It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it store water. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers with a distinctive horn-like shape. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among succulent enthusiasts."
