    "intro": "Huernia brevirostris var. pallida, commonly known as the pale horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem with tubercles and spines, adapted for arid environments. The plant produces pale yellow to white flowers during the warm season, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xerophytic collections due to its drought tolerance."
