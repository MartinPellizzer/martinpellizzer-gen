It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
