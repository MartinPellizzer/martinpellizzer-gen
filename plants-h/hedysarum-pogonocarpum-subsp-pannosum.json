    "intro": "Hedysarum pogonocarpum subsp. pannosum, commonly known as the meadow vetchling, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in small, alternate leaves with pinnate divisions. Its flowers are pea-shaped, ranging in color from white to pale yellow, and are arranged in loose clusters. The subspecies pannosum is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its slightly different floral structure compared to other subspecies."
