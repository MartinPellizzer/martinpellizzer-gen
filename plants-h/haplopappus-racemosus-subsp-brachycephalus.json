    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. brachycephalus, commonly known as the short-headed goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or biennial herb with a compact, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are clustered near the top of the stems. Its leaves are typically oblanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture adapted to reduce water loss. The species is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing forage for desert wildlife."
