    "intro": "Hydrocotyle minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle minutifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
