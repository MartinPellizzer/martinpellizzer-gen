    "intro": "Hexalobus grandiflorus var. inaequilateriflorus, commonly known as the unequal-sided grandiflorus, is a variant of the hexalobus genus characterized by its distinctive floral morphology. The plant features large, showy flowers with six petals, though the arrangement of these petals differs from the typical form, giving it the \"unequal-sided\" designation. Its leaves are usually lanceolate and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The species is native to specific regions in tropical climates, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Botanically, it is noted for its unique floral symmetry and is of interest in horticultural studies due to its aesthetic value and genetic variability."
