    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. galbanifolium, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. The subspecies galbanifolium is distinguished by its aromatic, resinous leaves that emit a strong, turpentine-like scent. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, often in temperate regions of Europe. This plant is also noted for its ability to produce a milky latex when damaged, a feature shared by many members of the Asteraceae family."
