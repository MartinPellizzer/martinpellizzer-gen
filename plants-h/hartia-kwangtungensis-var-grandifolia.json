    "intro": "Hartia kwangtungensis var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Guangdong hartia, is a rare flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and is known for its delicate, grass-like foliage. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
