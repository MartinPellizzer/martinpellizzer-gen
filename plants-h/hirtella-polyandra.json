    "intro": "Hirtella polyandra, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers and smooth, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible but have a sharp, acidic taste. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it is considered a problematic species in some regions."
