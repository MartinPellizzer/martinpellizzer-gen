It features slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or mauve in color. The plant is characterized by its aromatic leaves, which emit a distinctive scent when crushed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforest or woodland habitats. Hemigenia ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional Indigenous medicine."
