    "intro": "Hebe fruticeti, commonly known as the rock hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, usually blooming in spring and summer. Its foliage is evergreen, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Hebe fruticeti is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal environments."
