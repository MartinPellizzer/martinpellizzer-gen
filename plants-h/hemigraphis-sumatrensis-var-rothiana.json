    "intro": "Hemigraphis sumatrensis var. rothiana, commonly known as the silver-leafed moss rose, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or pale green pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom during the warm seasons. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens, hanging baskets, and as a ground cover."
