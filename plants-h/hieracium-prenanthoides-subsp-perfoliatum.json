    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. perfoliatum, commonly known as the perforate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The leaves are typically lobed and have a distinctive perforated or notched appearance, which gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
