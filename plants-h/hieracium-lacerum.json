    "intro": "Hieracium lacerum, commonly known as the broken hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium lacerum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
