    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. obversiforme, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lanceolate and covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in composite inflorescences, with ray florets that are often reflexed or backward-curled. It is commonly found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it identifiable within the Hieracium genus, though it is often confused with other similar species."
