    "intro": "Halacsya, commonly known as the common tansy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. Halacsya is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a long history of use in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds and is not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
