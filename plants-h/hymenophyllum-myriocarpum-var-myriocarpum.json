    "intro": "Hymenophyllum myriocarpum var. myriocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often curling fronds, which are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds and are adapted for wind dispersal. The species is notable for its intricate leaf anatomy, which includes a thin, membranous lamina and a complex arrangement of vascular tissue."
