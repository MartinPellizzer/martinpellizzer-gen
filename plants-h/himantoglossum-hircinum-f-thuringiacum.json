    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. thuringiacum, commonly known as the Thuringian marsh orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers with a unique, spurred lip that distinguishes it from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in wet meadows and marshy areas, thriving in nutrient-poor, acidic soils. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
