    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tunbrigense, commonly known as the tunbridge fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair-like structures called trichomes. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the leaves. The plant's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an important species in the study of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns."
