    "intro": "Huperzia intermedia, commonly known as the common huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a unique feature of the Huperziaceae family. Huperzia intermedia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its simple yet distinctive morphology makes it a recognizable and ecologically significant plant in its native habitats."
