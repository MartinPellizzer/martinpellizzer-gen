It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Hypacanthium elata is also known to host specific species of butterflies, making it ecologically significant in its native habitat."
