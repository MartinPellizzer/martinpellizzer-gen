    "intro": "Hohenbergia spicata, commonly known as the spike hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant produces striking, spire-like inflorescences that bear small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia spicata is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
