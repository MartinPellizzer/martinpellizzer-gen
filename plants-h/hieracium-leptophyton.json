It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has hairy, slender stems and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium leptophyton is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some habitats."
