    "intro": "Hieracium epilosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streambanks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The flowers bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
