    "intro": "Hieracium pannosiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium pannosiforme is often found in colonies, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
