    "intro": "Hedysarum limprichtii, commonly known as the Tibetan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a perennial herb characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Due to its ecological importance, it is also of interest in botanical research for its adaptability to extreme conditions."
