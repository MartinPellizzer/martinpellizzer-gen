    "intro": "Haydonia monophylla, commonly known as the single-leaf orchid, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It is characterized by its striking, solitary leaf that is often broader than it is long, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a subtle beauty to its foliage. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Haydonia monophylla is considered an endangered species."
