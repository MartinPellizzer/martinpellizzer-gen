    "intro": "Hieracium suppansum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are often hairy and can be lobed or toothed, while the stem is usually erect and branched. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest clearings. Hieracium suppansum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
