    "intro": "Huernia scabra var. quinta, commonly known as the horned African beauty, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often covered in short, spiky tubercles, giving it a unique, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight to flourish. Due to its slow growth and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and indoor gardens."
