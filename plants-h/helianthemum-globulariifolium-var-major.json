It features dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
