It is characterized by its reduced pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to the typical form. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests. The leaves are lanceolate, and the flowers are small and clustered, contributing to its ornamental value in horticulture."
