    "intro": "Hohenbergia andina, commonly known as the Andean hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Hohenbergia andina is well adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid conditions with partial shade. Its unique appearance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for collectors and gardeners interested in rare bromeliads."
