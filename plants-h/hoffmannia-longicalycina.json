    "intro": "Hoffmannia longicalycina, commonly known as the long calyx hoffmannia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and tall, branching stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Hoffmannia longicalycina is valued for its delicate foliage and extended flowering period, which can last from late spring to early autumn."
