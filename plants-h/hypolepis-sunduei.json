    "intro": "Hypolepis sunduei, commonly known as the Sundue's water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Dennstaedtiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that often form a rosette structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or swampy areas. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which aid in water absorption. The fronds are usually bipinnate, with a distinctive, almost lace-like appearance that contributes to its ornamental value."
