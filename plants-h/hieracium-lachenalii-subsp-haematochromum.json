    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. haematochromum, commonly known as the blood-red hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its striking red-tinged flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in dense, flat clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its vivid red coloration, which is more intense than in other members of the Hieracium genus."
