    "intro": "Haloscias scothicum monstr. phyllomana, commonly known as the Scottish leaf moss, is a rare and unique species of liverwort found in specific alpine and coastal environments. It exhibits a creeping growth habit with dense, overlapping foliage that forms a mat-like structure. The plant's leaves are small, ovate, and typically have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded areas with high humidity and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
