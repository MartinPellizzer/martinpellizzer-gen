    "intro": "Hedysarum arenarium, commonly known as sand clover, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Hedysarum arenarium is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought and poor nutrient conditions."
