It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval fruits. It is often used in water gardens and can help in water purification by absorbing nutrients."
