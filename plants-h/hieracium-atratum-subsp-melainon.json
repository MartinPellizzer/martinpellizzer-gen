    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. melainon, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosettes. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive black center, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
