    "intro": "Halimiphyllum eurypterum, commonly known as the coastal heath, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form. The plant features small, needle-like leaves that are covered in a thick, waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in sandy, coastal soils. Its flowers are typically white or pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Halimiphyllum eurypterum is well adapted to salt spray and wind, making it a common sight in dune and beach environments."
