    "intro": "Hieracium glacialiforme, commonly known as the glacier dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky areas. Its scientific name reflects its glacial habitat and its resemblance to the common dandelion. Hieracium glacialiforme is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions and is a symbol of resilience in high-altitude ecosystems."
