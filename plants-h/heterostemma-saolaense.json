    "intro": "Heterostemma saolaense, commonly known as the Saola vine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes approximately 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its climbing habit, with opposite, ovate leaves and small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems. Due to habitat loss and limited study, the botanical details of this rare species remain largely undocumented."
