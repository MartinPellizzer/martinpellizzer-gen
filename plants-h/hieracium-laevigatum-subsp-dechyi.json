    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. dechyi, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb with hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
