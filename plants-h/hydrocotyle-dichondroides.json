    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dichondroides, commonly known as swamp pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle dichondroides is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
