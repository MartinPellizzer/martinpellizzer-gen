    "intro": "Hemipilia kinoshitae, commonly known as the Kinoshita's hemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in a loose spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
