    "intro": "Helianthus annuus f. lenticularis, commonly known as the lenticular sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its unique, lens-shaped leaves. This form exhibits a compact growth habit with shorter stems compared to the standard sunflower. The leaves are thick and fleshy, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces large, yellow-orange flower heads that follow the sun's movement, a trait known as heliotropism. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
