    "intro": "Hedysarum violaceum, commonly known as violet vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive violet hue. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from violet to white, typically blooming in late spring. Its trifoliate leaves and papilionaceous flowers are typical of the Fabaceae family, and it is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. Hedysarum violaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
