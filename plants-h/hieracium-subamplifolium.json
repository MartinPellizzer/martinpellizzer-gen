    "intro": "Hieracium subamplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flower heads that resemble dandelions. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
