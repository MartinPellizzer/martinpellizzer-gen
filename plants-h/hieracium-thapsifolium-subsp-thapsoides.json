    "intro": "Hieracium thapsifolium subsp. thapsoides, commonly known as field hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, often with wavy margins, and stems that are usually unbranched. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, ribbed achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
