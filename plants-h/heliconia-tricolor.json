    "intro": "Heliconia tricolor, commonly known as the red ginger or the flame ginger, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that range from red to orange and yellow, which are not actual flowers but modified leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers inside the bracts, which are pollinated by birds and insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Heliconia tricolor is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
