It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, recurved shape. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires ample sunlight to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
