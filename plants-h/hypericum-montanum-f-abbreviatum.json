    "intro": "Hypericum montanum f. abbreviatum, commonly known as the compact St. John's wort, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly cultivated than other St. John's wort varieties. Its compact form makes it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
