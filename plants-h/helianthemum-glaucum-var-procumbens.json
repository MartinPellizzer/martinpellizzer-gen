    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically covered in a whitish, powdery coating called a bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
