    "intro": "Helianthemum viride, commonly known as green stonecress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, bright green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Helianthemum viride is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
