It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy, seed-filled heads that are often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its name comes from the Greek words \"helios\" meaning sun and \"chrysum\" meaning gold, reflecting its radiant appearance."
