It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with yellow and white markings. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for covering walls and trellises."
