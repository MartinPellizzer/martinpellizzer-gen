    "intro": "Hemibaccharis, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in South America, particularly in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with thick, rough bark and alternate, simple leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or red, followed by capsule fruits containing seeds. Hemibaccharis species are adapted to a variety of habitats, including dry forests and grasslands, and some are used in traditional medicine."
