    "intro": "Herbertia watsonii, commonly known as Watson's herbertia, is a striking evergreen perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color, with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland borders. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
