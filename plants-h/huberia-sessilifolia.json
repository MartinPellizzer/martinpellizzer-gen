    "intro": "Huberia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaved huberia, is a member of the Apocynaceae family. It is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa, typically found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features simple, opposite leaves that are sessile, meaning they lack a petiole and attach directly to the stem. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with five fused petals that are often pink or purple in color. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in rock gardens due to its compact growth habit."
