    "intro": "Hieracium limenyense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium limenyense is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a resilient wildflower."
