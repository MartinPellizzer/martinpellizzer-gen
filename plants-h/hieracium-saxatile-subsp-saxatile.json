It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in crevices and on rocky slopes, adapting to nutrient-poor soils and harsh climatic conditions. Its leaves are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its resilience and is often found in mountainous regions across the Alps and Carpathians."
