    "intro": "Henckelia calcarea, commonly known as the limestone henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the humid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, which is reflected in its common name. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it often grows in shaded, forested environments. Henckelia calcarea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
