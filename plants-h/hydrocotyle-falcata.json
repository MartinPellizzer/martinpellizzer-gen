    "intro": "Hydrocotyle falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it thrives in moist, sandy or muddy substrates. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often submerged, with some floating on the water surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters, and it produces small, smooth seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle falcata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic environments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
