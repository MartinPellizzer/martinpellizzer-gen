It produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its prolonged blooming period and subtle fragrance."
