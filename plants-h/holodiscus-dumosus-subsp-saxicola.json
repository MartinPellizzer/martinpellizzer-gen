    "intro": "Holodiscus dumosus subsp. saxicola, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and opposite, ovate leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with a Mediterranean climate."
