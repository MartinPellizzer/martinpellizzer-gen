    "intro": "Helianthemum ocymoides subsp. algarvense, commonly known as the Algarve rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
