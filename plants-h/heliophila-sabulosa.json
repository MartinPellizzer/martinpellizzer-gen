    "intro": "Heliophila sabulosa, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to sandy soils in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in well-drained, dry environments. It is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Heliophila sabulosa is a member of the Gentianaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar ecological adaptations."
