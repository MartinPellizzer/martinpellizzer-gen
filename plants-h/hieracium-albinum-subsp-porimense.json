    "intro": "Hieracium albinum subsp. porimense, commonly known as the Porimense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
