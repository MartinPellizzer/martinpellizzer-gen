    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subcillatum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
