    "intro": "Huperzia niligarica, commonly known as the Niligiri clubmoss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including the Himalayas and Southeast Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called synangia, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. Huperzia niligarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
