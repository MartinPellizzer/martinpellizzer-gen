    "intro": "Heracleum pedatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to North America. It features a thick, hollow stem with purple spots and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are hairy and have a distinctive, slightly toxic odor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clustered umbels, which are pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and can be harvested for use in traditional herbal medicine. Cow parsnip is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites."
