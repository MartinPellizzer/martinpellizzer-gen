    "intro": "Helianthus annuus mut. inornatus, commonly known as the \"inornate sunflower,\" is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its lack of ray florets, resulting in a predominantly disk-like appearance. This mutation leads to a more compact flower head with a dense arrangement of tubular florets. It is native to North America and typically grows in open fields and disturbed soils. The plant is an annual herb with a robust stem and large, broad leaves. Its botanical features make it a unique subject in both horticulture and botanical studies."
