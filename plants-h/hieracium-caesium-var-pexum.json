    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. pexum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and yellow disc flowers. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
