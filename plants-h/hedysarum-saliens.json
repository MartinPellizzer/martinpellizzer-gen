    "intro": "Hedysarum saliens, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. Its small, elongated pods contain several seeds, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. Hedysarum saliens is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
