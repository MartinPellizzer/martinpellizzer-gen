    "intro": "Hieracium epimedium subsp. laevipedunculum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish to reddish flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and relatively small, clustered flower heads. It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
