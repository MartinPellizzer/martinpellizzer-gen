    "intro": "Hosackia stolonifera var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features upright, branched stems covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pea-like purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, with oval leaflets that are also hairy, contributing to its overall textured foliage. This variety is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
