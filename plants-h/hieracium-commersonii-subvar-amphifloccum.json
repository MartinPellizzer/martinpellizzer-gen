    "intro": "Hieracium commersonii subvar. amphifloccum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern South America. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is hairy and often branched. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more robust florets compared to other varieties of Hieracium."
