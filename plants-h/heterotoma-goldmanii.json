    "intro": "Heterotoma goldmanii, commonly known as the Goldman's heterotoma, is a species of moth belonging to the family Tineidae. It is characterized by its distinctive wing patterns, which often feature intricate, iridescent markings. The plant associated with this species is not a true plant but rather a fungal substrate, as the moth feeds on fungi and lichens. Its larvae are typically found in moist, shaded environments where their food sources thrive. The species is of interest to entomologists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
