It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that collect water, creating a small pool that supports aquatic life. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with vibrant red and orange flowers that bloom in the early morning. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is a subject of interest for botanists and plant enthusiasts alike."
