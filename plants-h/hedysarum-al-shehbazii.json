It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with 5 to 7 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils.
