    "intro": "Hymenophyllum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant typically grows on rocks or trees in humid, shaded environments, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, round groups on the underside of the fronds. The species is known for its unique morphology and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
