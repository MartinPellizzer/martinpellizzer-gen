    "intro": "Hieracium paltinae subsp. bifidelliforme, commonly known as the bifidelliform hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with basal leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which are composed of many small florets. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
