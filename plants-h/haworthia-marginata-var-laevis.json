    "intro": "Haworthia marginata var. laevis, commonly known as the smooth-margin Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are fleshy and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its low maintenance and unique appearance in succulent collections."
