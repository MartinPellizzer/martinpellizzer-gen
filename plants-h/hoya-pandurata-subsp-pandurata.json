    "intro": "Hoya pandurata subsp. pandurata, commonly known as the \"Cup and Saucer Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. It is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements. The plant is also noted for its ability to form aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
