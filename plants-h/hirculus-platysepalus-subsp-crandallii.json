    "intro": "Hirculus platysepalus subsp. crandallii, commonly known as the Crandall's flat-sepal orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, broad, flat sepals that give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires a dry, sunny environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
