    "intro": "Hicriopteris glauca, commonly known as blue hickory, is a species of fern native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy green fronds that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are found on the underside of the fronds. Hicriopteris glauca plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
