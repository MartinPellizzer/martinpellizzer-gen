    "intro": "Hemerocallis littorea, commonly known as the marsh daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, fragrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is adapted to waterlogged soils and can tolerate periodic flooding, making it a common sight in riparian zones. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands, which can help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Despite its ornamental value, it is also considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread."
