    "intro": "Hieracium paragogiforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and has a sprawling, rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in clusters. It is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
