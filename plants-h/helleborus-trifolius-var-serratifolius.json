    "intro": "Helleborus trifolius var. serratifolius, commonly known as the serrated-leaved hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are deeply lobed and have serrated edges, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
