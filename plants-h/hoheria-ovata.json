    "intro": "Hoheria ovata, commonly known as the silver mist tree, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds like the silvereye. Hoheria ovata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to coastal and sunny environments. It is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife and its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
