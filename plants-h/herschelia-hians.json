It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Herschelia hians is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed."
