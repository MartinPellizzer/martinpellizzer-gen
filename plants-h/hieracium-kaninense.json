    "intro": "Hieracium kaninense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disc of tubular florets. Hieracium kaninense is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in its native range."
