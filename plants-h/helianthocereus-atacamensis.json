    "intro": "Helianthocereus atacamensis, commonly known as the Atacama night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive rib structure and spines that provide protection against herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, enabling it to survive in extremely dry environments. The plant is adapted to high-altitude desert conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience to drought and temperature extremes."
