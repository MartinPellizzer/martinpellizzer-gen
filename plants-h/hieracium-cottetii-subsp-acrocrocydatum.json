    "intro": "Hieracium cottetii subsp. acrocrocydatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are generally shorter than the leaves, and the plant is known for its compact growth habit. Hieracium cottetii subsp. acrocrocydatum is a relatively rare species, often found in specific microhabitats within its native range."
