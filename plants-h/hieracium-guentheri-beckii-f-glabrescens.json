    "intro": "Hieracium guentheri-beckii f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, though the 'glabrescens' form is distinguished by its reduced hairiness. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and often locally distributed species."
