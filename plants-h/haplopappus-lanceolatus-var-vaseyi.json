    "intro": "Haplopappus lanceolatus var. vaseyi, commonly known as the narrowleaf goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lanceolate, narrow, and often have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are surrounded by bracts, typical of the genus Haplopappus."
