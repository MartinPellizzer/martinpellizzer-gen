    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia var. albomarginata, commonly known as the White-edged Lanceleaf Hosta, is a cultivar characterized by its striking white margins on its lance-shaped, medium-green leaves. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is native to eastern Asia, particularly China. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and features fragrant, pale blue to lavender flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate, showy inflorescences."
