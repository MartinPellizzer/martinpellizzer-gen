It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters, with woody stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
