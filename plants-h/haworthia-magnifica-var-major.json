    "intro": "Haworthia magnifica var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
