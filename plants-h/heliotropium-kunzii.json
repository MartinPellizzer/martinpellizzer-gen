    "intro": "Heliotropium kunzii, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its leaves are typically opposite and have a velvety texture, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. Heliotropium kunzii is often found growing on rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in conditions of low rainfall and high temperatures."
