It is a perennial species characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is adapted to thrive in poor soils. Its subspecies distinction highlights its unique morphological and ecological traits compared to other hawkweed species."
