    "intro": "Hedysarum ramosum, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in spikes, which are followed by long, slender pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum ramosum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with Rhizobium bacteria in its root nodules."
