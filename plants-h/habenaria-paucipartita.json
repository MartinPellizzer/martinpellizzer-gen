    "intro": "Habenaria paucipartita, commonly known as the few-parted orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The orchid has a complex structure with a single leaf and a highly specialized reproductive system typical of the Orchidaceae family."
