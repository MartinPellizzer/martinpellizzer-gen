It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties.
