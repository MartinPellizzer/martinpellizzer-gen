It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
