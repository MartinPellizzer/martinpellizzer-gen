    "intro": "Hesperastragalus diphacus, commonly known as the two-seeded milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and compound leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, bean-like pods that contain two seeds, which is a distinguishing feature of the species. Hesperastragalus diphacus is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, contributing to nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
