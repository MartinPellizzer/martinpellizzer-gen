It is a low-growing shrub with grey-green, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ability to retain moisture in its leaves helps it survive in dry conditions."
