    "intro": "Hyacinthoides hispanica subsp. algeriensis, commonly known as Algerian bluebells, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It produces striking clusters of violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It thrives in woodland environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This subspecies is closely related to the common bluebell, but can be distinguished by its slightly different flower color and habitat preferences."
