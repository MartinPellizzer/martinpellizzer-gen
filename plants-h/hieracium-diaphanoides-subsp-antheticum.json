    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. antheticum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
