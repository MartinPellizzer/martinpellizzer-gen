    "intro": "Hevea pauciflora var. coriacea, commonly known as the rough bark rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, rugged bark and elliptical leaves that are dark green and glossy. The plant is part of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential future rubber production."
