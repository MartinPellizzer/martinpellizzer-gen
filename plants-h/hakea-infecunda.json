    "intro": "Hakea infecunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and clusters of bright red or pink flowers that appear in spring. The plant has a woody stem and produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep roots that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea infecunda is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance."
