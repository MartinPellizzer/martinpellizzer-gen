It features small, bright red or pink flowers that bloom in late summer, often in clusters along the stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptical in shape, with a distinctive woolly or pubescent texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a border plant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
