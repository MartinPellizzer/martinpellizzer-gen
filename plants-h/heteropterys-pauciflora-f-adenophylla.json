    "intro": "Heteropterys pauciflora f. adenophylla, commonly known as the\u817a\u53f6\u5f02\u5507\u8336, is a rare and unique variant of the species Heteropterys pauciflora. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, where the leaves are modified to have glandular structures, giving them a glandular appearance. This botanical feature is a key distinguishing trait of the form adenophylla. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphological adaptations, which may provide insights into evolutionary responses to environmental conditions."
