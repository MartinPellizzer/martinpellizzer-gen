    "intro": "Homalocenchrus virginicus, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. It has adapted to thrive in sandy, coastal environments with well-drained soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
