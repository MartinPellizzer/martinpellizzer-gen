It thrives in moist environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a wavy margin, which gives it its common name. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically arranged in spikes. Hygrophila undulata is valued in aquatic gardening for its ornamental appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
