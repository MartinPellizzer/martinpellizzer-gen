    "intro": "Hieracium euparyphum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
