    "intro": "Hieracium subprolatescens, commonly known as the subprolate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium subprolatescens is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
