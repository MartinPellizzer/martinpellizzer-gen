The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
