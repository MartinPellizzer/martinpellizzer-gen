    "intro": "Herniaria parnassica subsp. cretica, commonly known as Cretan sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native range."
