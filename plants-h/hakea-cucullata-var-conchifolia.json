    "intro": "Hakea cucullata var. conchifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and distinctive, cone-shaped inflorescences that produce yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This plant is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal habitats. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
