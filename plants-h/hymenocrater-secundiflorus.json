    "intro": "Hymenocrater secundiflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered hymenocrater, is a species of flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as under forest canopies, and has simple, alternate leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five petals that are arranged symmetrically, and it produces small, red berries as fruit. Hymenocrater secundiflorus is of interest to botanists due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution."
