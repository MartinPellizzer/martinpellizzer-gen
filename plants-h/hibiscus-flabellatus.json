    "intro": "Hibiscus flabellatus, commonly known as the fanleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the warm season. Hibiscus flabellatus thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
