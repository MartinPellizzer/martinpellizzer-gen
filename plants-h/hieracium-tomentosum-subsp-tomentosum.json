    "intro": "Hieracium tomentosum subsp. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are covered in dense, soft hairs, which give it a distinctive woolly appearance. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
