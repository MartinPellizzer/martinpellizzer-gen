It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its tuberous root system is a distinguishing feature, allowing it to store nutrients and water. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
