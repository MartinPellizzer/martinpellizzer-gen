    "intro": "Heteropterys neblinensis, commonly known as the misty heteropterys, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its habitat. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Heteropterys neblinensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
