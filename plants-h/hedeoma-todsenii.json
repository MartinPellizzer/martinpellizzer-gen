    "intro": "Hedeoma todsenii, commonly known as Todsens blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. It has hairy, branching stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. Hedeoma todsenii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
