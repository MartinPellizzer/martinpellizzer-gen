    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. elegans, commonly known as the slender hogweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white or greenish-white flowers, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can reach large sizes, often with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. This species is known for its potential toxicity, particularly due to the presence of phototoxic compounds in its sap."
