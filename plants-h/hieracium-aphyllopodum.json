    "intro": "Hieracium aphyllopodum, commonly known as the leafless hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its lack of leaves, with only a short stem and a cluster of yellow flowers at the top. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology, it is a subject of interest in botanical studies and ecological research."
