    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. peleterianum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more upright. Its flowers are yellow, with five petals, and are arranged in a loose cluster at the top of the stem. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
