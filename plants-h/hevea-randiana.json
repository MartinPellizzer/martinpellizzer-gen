    "intro": "Hevea randiana, commonly known as the African rubber tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape and have a smooth, glossy surface. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in panicles, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing a single seed. Its latex, while not as commercially valuable as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications. The plant is also noted for its ecological importance in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
