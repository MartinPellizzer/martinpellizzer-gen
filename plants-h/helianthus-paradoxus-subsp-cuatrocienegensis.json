    "intro": "Helianthus paradoxus subsp. cuatrocienegensis, commonly known as the Cuatrocienegas sunflower, is a rare and endemic species native to a small region in Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow-orange ray flowers and dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
