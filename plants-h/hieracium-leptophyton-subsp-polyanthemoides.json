    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. polyanthemoides, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, ribbed, and often hairy stems that bear the flowering heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flower heads compared to other members of the species."
