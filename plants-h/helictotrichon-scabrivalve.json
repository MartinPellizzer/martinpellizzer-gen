    "intro": "Helictotrichon scabrivalve, commonly known as the roughleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, sandpapery texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Helictotrichon scabrivalve is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
