    "intro": "Haplophyllum linifolium subsp. linifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved haplophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its linear, often slightly hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
