    "intro": "Heliotropium saltianum, commonly known as the saltbush heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant thrives in saline soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low water availability. Its leaves are typically small, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Heliotropium saltianum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
