    "intro": "Hebe buxifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that has a distinctive silvery-gray appearance due to a fine layer of pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or blue during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe buxifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
