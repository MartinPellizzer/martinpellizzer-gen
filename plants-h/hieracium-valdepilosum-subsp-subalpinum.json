    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the subalpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine vegetation, contributing to soil stabilization and biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
