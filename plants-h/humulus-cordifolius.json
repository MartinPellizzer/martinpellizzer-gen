    "intro": "Humulus cordifolius, commonly known as Chinese hops, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and cylindrical, hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in catkins. It is often cultivated for its use in traditional Chinese medicine and as a source of bioactive compounds. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more widely known hops used in brewing."
