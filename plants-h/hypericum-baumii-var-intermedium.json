    "intro": "Hypericum baumii var. intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, woody stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cymes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its medicinal properties are similar to those of other Hypericum species, with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes."
