    "intro": "Helichrysum ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-orange inflorescences that resemble daisies. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, moist climates of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid environment. Helichrysum ruwenzoriense is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its attractive, long-lasting flowers."
