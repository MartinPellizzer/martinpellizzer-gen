    "intro": "Harperocallis duidae, commonly known as the Duidae lily, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Harperocallis duidae is considered a botanically significant but endangered species."
