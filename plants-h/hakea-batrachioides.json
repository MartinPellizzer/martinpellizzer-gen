    "intro": "Hakea batrachioides, commonly known as the water hakea, is a shrub native to south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits that contain seeds. It is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Hakea batrachioides is an important plant in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
