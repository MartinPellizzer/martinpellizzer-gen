    "intro": "Hieracium grandifolium, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in sunny, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Hieracium grandifolium is known for its ability to spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it a potential invasive species in some regions."
