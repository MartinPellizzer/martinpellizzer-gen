    "intro": "Henckelia collegii-sancti-thomasii, commonly known as the San Thomas henckelia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories, where it relies on specific soil conditions for survival. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, with a distinct aromatic scent, and it produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
