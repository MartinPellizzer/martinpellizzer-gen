    "intro": "Hypericum empetrifolium, commonly known as the stonecrop St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, rocky environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are typical of the Hypericaceae family. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hypericum empetrifolium is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats."
