    "intro": "Hieracium appendiculatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and bloom from June to September, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium appendiculatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit."
