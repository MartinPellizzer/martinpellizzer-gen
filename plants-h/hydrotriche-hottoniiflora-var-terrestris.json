    "intro": "Hydrotriche hottoniiflora var. terrestris, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads that resemble dandelion fluff. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it store water, adapting to its harsh, dry environment. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its structure and growth patterns make it well-suited for survival in extreme desert conditions."
