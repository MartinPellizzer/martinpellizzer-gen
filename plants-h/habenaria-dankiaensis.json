It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences with a distinctive, spurred shape. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
