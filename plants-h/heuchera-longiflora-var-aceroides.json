It is characterized by its striking, heart-shaped foliage with deep red veins against a dark green background. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
