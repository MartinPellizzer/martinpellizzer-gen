    "intro": "Hydrangea schlimii, commonly known as the dwarf hydrangea or mountain hydrangea, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its unique, cone-shaped flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for small garden spaces or containers. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that provide an attractive backdrop to its blooms. Hydrangea schlimii prefers partial shade and well-draining soil, and it is relatively low maintenance once established."
