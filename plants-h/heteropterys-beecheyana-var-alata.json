    "intro": "Heteropterys beecheyana var. alata, commonly known as the winged bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually alternate and palmately lobed, while the varietal name \"alata\" refers to the wing-like structures on its bracts. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
