It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers.

Hemicarpha drummondii is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
