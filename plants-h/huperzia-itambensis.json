    "intro": "Huperzia itambensis, commonly known as the Itamb\u00e9 huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia itambensis is notable for its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its primitive features and ecological significance in its native habitat."
