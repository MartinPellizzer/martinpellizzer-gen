    "intro": "Helichrysum frigidum var. platylepis, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish or golden flowers that are often retained after flowering, giving the plant a dried appearance. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environmental conditions."
