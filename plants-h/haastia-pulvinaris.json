    "intro": "Haastia pulvinaris, commonly known as the tuatara plant, is a unique member of the Agavaceae family native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, spire-like growth habit and produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant has a thick, fibrous stem covered in a layer of scaly bark, which provides protection against environmental stress. Its flowers are typically green or yellowish-green, with prominent white tepals and stamens. Haastia pulvinaris is adapted to grow in dry, rocky environments and is considered a rare and protected species in its native habitat."
