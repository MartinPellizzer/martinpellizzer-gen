    "intro": "Hudsonia ericoides subsp. andersonii, commonly known as Anderson's heath, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It features dense, compact foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. This subspecies is often found in rocky outcrops and coastal dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
