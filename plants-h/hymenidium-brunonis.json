    "intro": "Hymenidium brunonis, commonly known as the black-horned fern, is a rare and unusual member of the Hymenidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, dark-colored, horn-like structures that emerge from the base of its fronds. The plant is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology includes a short, thick rhizome with clustered, leathery fronds that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Hymenidium brunonis is primarily valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized botanical collections."
