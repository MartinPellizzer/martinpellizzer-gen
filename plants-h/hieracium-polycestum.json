    "intro": "Hieracium polycestum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium polycestum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
