    "intro": "Haematoxylum brasiletto, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species in many regions."
