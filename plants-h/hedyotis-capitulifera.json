    "intro": "Hedyotis capitulifera, commonly known as the clustered dotweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers arranged in dense, compact clusters, which give it its species name \"capitulifera,\" meaning \"bearing heads.\" The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with slightly serrated edges, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Hedyotis capitulifera is valued in horticulture for its ornamental flowers and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
