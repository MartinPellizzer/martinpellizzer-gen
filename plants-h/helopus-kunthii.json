    "intro": "Helopus kunthii, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with small, thick leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helopus kunthii is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
