    "intro": "Hieracium strictoides, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has upright, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered with fine hairs. Hieracium strictoides is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
