    "intro": "Helichrysum riparium, commonly known as the sandplain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with well-drained conditions. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, papery seeds that are dispersed by wind. Helichrysum riparium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
