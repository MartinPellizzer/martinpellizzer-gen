    "intro": "Hypogynium foveolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hypogynium, is a rare and specialized plant species characterized by its unique botanical features. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forest understories. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its stem. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with distinctive foveolate structures on the hypogynium, which is a key identifying feature. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
