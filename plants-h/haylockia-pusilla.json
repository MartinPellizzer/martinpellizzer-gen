    "intro": "Haylockia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf haylockia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often overlooked. Haylockia pusilla is a low-growing species, rarely exceeding a few inches in height. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed, moist habitats."
