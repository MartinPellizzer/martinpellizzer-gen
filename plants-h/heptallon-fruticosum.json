    "intro": "Heptallon fruticosum, commonly known as the creeping lily or wild lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and usually pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Heptallon fruticosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
