    "intro": "Hetaeria whitmeei, commonly known as the dwarf hetaeria, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and green, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
