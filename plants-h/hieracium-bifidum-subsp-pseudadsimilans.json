    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudadsimilans, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It features upright stems with alternate, deeply lobed leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
