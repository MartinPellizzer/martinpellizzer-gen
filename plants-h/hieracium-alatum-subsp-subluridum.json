    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. subluridum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. Its inflorescence consists of ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help distinguish it from closely related hawkweed species."
