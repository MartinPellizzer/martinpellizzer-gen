    "intro": "Hedysarum reticulatum, commonly known as the net-veined milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along mountain slopes. The plant features compound leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, and its flowers are usually pink to reddish in color, arranged in clusters. Hedysarum reticulatum is part of the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with soil bacteria. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in restoration projects."
