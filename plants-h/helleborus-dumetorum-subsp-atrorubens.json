    "intro": "Helleborus dumetorum subsp. atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of deep red, purple, and black, which bloom in late winter or early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
