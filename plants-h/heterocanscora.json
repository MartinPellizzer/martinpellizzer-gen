    "intro": "Heterocanscora, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, especially when backlit. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and closely spaced, allowing for efficient moisture retention. Heterocanscora is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
