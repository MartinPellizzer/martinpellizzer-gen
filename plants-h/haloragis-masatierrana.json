    "intro": "Haloragis masatierrana, commonly known as the Masatierra willowherb, is a perennial herb native to South America, particularly Chile. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and riverbanks. It has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Haloragis masatierrana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
