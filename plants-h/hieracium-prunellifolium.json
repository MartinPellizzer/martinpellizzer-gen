    "intro": "Hieracium prunellifolium, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are bright purple or pink, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium prunellifolium is known for its robust growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
