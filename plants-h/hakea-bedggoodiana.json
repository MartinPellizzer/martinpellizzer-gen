    "intro": "Hakea bedggoodiana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well adapted to coastal and semi-arid conditions. Hakea bedggoodiana is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
