    "intro": "Hieracium cynanchoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central dark center. Hieracium cynanchoides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
