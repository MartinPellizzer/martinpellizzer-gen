    "intro": "Helicteres calcicola, commonly known as the limestone helicteres, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often found in areas with low rainfall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helicteres calcicola is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
