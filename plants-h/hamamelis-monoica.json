    "intro": "Hamamelis monoica, commonly known as the singleleaf witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its yellow, fragrant flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has simple, opposite, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces capsule fruits that release seeds in the spring. Hamamelis monoica is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
