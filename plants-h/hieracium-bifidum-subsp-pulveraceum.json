    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pulveraceum, commonly known as the powdered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, which gives it its common name and helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
