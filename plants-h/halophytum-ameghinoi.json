It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to store water. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it a halophyte, or salt-tolerant species. Due to its unique adaptations, it is of interest to botanists studying desert flora and plant resilience."
