    "intro": "Habenaria tosariensis, commonly known as the Tosari orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), adapted to retain moisture in its humid habitat. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
