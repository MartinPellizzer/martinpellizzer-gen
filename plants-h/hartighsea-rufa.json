    "intro": "Hartighsea rufa, commonly known as the red-harted sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking, spiky, red-tinged flower heads that resemble small holly berries. The plant thrives in saline and well-drained soils, often found in dunes and rocky shores. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. Hartighsea rufa plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and provides habitat for various insects and small marine life."
