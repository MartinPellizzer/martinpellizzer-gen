    "intro": "Hyperacanthus ravinensis, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid habitat.
