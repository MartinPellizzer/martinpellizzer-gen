    "intro": "Heliophila scabrida, commonly known as the rough heliophila, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name *scabrida*, and it blooms from June to August. Heliophila scabrida is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and ecological researchers."
