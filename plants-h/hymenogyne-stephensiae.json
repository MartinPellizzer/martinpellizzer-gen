    "intro": "Hymenogyne stephensiae, commonly known as the Stephens' hymenogynous plant, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive floral structure, featuring specialized bracts that enclose the flowers, a feature that sets it apart from other members of its family. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hymenogyne stephensiae is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to researchers studying plant evolution and ecology."
