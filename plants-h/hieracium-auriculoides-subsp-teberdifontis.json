It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
