    "intro": "Hieracium villosioides, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
