    "intro": "Hosta ventricosa, commonly known as the giant panda plant, is a striking perennial plant native to China. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The leaves are typically a deep green with a prominent white or light green margin, creating a striking contrast. It produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than its foliage. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
