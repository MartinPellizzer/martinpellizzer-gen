    "intro": "Hieracium rupicola var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in poor soils, often on limestone or rocky substrates, and thrives in full sun. Its compact growth habit and hairy stems help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The flowers, which are yellowish-green, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
