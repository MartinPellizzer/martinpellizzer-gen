It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium praecelsum is also known for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions as a garden plant."
