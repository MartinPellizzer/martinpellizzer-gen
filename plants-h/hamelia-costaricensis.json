    "intro": "Hamelia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican firebush, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright orange to red tubular flowers that bloom from spring to summer. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for tropical gardens."
