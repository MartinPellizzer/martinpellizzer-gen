    "intro": "Haitimimosa, commonly known as the \"Brazilian mimosa,\" is a deciduous shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features delicate, fern-like leaves that are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haitimimosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a native, low-maintenance plant."
