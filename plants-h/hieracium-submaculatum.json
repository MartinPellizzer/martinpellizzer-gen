It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
