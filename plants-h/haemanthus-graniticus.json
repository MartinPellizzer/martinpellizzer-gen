    "intro": "Haemanthus graniticus, commonly known as the granite haemanthus, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, umbellate inflorescence of bright red flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It features strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Haemanthus graniticus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
