    "intro": "Hieracium lineolatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium lineolatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
