    "intro": "Hylotelephium ettyuense, commonly known as the Ettyuense stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Hylotelephium ettyuense is relatively low-maintenance, requiring well-draining soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
