    "intro": "Hieracium coactile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can spread aggressively through its rhizomes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium coactile is also known for its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, leading to a variety of morphological forms."
