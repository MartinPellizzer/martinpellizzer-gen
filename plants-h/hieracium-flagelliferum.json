    "intro": "Hieracium flagelliferum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium flagelliferum is known for its aggressive growth and can form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation."
