    "intro": "Houstonia caerulea, commonly known as blue mistflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features delicate, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle yet striking visual appeal to woodland gardens. The plant has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a versatile choice for native plant gardens. Houstonia caerulea is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
