    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
