    "intro": "Helichrysum gossypinum, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid regions. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few days, but the plant is known for its ability to retain its color even after flowering. Helichrysum gossypinum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
