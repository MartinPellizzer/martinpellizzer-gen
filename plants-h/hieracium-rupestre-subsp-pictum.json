    "intro": "Hieracium rupestre subsp. pictum, commonly known as the painted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
