    "intro": "Hieracium djimilense subsp. violascens, commonly known as the violet-hued hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces showy, violet to purple composite flowers. The subspecies is native to specific regions in Eastern Africa, where it thrives in grassland and open habitats. It has small, hairy stems and is often found in dry, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Hieracium genus."
