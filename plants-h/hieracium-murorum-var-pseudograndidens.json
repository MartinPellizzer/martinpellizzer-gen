    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. pseudograndidens, commonly known as the giant mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of broad, hairy leaves and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can form dense mats, often in meadows or along roadsides. It is distinguished by its larger leaf size compared to other Hieracium species, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in certain regions."
