It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or purple in color. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia polyliria is adapted to salt spray and is an important part of coastal ecosystems."
