    "intro": "Heracleum viscidulum, commonly known as sticky hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. The plant has smooth, green leaves with a rough, sticky texture, which helps in identifying it. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the carrot family. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant that should be handled with care."
