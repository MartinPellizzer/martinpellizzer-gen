    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus f. repandus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved night blooming cactus, is a unique cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its sparsely branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often reduced to spines. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The f. repandus form is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of the species."
