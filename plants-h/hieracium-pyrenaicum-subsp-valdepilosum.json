    "intro": "Hieracium pyrenaicum subsp. valdepilosum, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
