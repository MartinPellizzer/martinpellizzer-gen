    "intro": "Hyparrhenia barteri, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that often have a reddish hue, especially when young. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodlands. Hyparrhenia barteri is valued for its use in livestock feed and for stabilizing soil in degraded areas."
