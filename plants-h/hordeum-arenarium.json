    "intro": "Hordeum arenarium, commonly known as sand barley, is a flowering plant species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescence. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into hard, straw-colored grains. Hordeum arenarium is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and can tolerate high levels of salinity and drought. It is sometimes used as a forage crop in marginal agricultural areas."
