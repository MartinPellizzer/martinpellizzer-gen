    "intro": "Hydrocotyle filipes, commonly known as slender water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often floating on the water. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in shallow water environments. Hydrocotyle filipes is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
