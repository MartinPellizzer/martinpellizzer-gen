    "intro": "Hymenasplenium latidens, commonly known as the broadleaf spleenwort, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance. It is a small, terrestrial liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. The plant has a thallus that is usually green and covered in tiny, leaf-like structures called phyllidia. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called soridia. Hymenasplenium latidens is often found in temperate regions and is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed ecosystems."
