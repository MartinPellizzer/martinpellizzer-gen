    "intro": "Hydrocotyle grumosa, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It features floating leaves that are broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots anchor it in muddy substrates. It plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms. Hydrocotyle grumosa is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds and marshes."
