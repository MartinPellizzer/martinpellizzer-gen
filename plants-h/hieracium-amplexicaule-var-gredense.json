    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule var. gredense, commonly known as the creeping oxeye daisy, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. The plant produces yellow flowers with white ray florets, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
