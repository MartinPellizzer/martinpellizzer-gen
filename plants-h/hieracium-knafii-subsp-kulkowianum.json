    "intro": "Hieracium knafii subsp. kulkowianum, commonly known as the Kulkowian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of leafy stems. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain areas. The species is characterized by its distinctive foliage and is often found in association with other flowering plants in grassland ecosystems."
