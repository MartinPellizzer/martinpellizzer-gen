    "intro": "Hypericum virgatum var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, lanceolate to oval-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, glandular dots. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous tiny petals and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its foliage and flowers contain compounds such as hypericin and pseudohypericin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland or open sandy soils."
