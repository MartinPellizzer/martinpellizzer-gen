    "intro": "Habenaria lucida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant produces delicate, white or pale green flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Its leaves are long, slender, and often curl around the stem, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Habenaria lucida is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
