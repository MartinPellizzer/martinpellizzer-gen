    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 stoloniferum nothovar. laurentianum, commonly known as the Laurentian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Laurentian region of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its spreading growth habit and stolons, which allow it to form dense mats. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It has finely dissected leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and open fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
