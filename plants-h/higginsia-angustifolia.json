    "intro": "Higginsia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf higginsia, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as carrots and parsley. The plant features slender, upright stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Higginsia angustifolia produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
