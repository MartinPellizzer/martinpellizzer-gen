    "intro": "Hieracium homalodermum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a hairy stem and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seed dispersal. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
