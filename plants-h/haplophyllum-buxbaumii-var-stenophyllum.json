    "intro": "Haplophyllum buxbaumii var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved haplophyllum, is a rare and unique plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its evergreen shrub form and adapted to rocky, well-drained soils. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a compact growth habit. It produces delicate white or pale pink flowers during the spring or early summer, which are clustered in inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
