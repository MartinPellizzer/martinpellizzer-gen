    "intro": "Huttonaea woodii, commonly known as the Hutton's woodii, is a rare and critically endangered flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It has small, narrow leaves and produces seeds in capsules that are dispersed by wind. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
