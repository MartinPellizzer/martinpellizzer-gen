It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-colored flesh and is typically found growing on trellises or in shaded areas. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit is edible, with a mildly sweet flavor, and is often consumed fresh or used in juices and desserts. The plant is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its nutritional and culinary uses."
