    "intro": "Hakea ericifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and distinctive, spike-like flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in coastal and sandy environments, showing high tolerance to salt and wind. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle, reducing water loss in arid conditions. Hakea ericifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
