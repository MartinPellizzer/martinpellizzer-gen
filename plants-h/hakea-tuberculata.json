    "intro": "Hakea tuberculata, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical branches and yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Hakea tuberculata is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
