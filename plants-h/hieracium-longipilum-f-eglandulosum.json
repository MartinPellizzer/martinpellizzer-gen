    "intro": "Hieracium longipilum f. eglandulosum, commonly known as the glandless hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Compositae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by the absence of glandular structures on its leaves, a key feature that sets it apart from other forms of Hieracium."
