    "intro": "Helichrysum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf everlasting, is a small, perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces papery, aromatic bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum pygmaeum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
