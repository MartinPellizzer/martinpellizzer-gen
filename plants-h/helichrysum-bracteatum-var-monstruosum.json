    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum var. monstruosum, commonly known as the African firecracker, is a striking evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bushy growth habit and its clusters of bright orange, flame-like flowers that resemble tiny firecrackers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that remain after the flowers fade, giving it a unique, long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is heightened by its ability to retain its vibrant color throughout the year."
