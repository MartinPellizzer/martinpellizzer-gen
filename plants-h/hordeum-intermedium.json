It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and other open habitats. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Hordeum intermedium is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its adaptability and ability to stabilize soil."
