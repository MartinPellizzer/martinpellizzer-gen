    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. australe, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters and is characterized by its milky, toxic sap containing phototoxic chemicals. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature and potential to cause severe skin reactions, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
