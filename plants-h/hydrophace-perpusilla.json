    "intro": "Hydrophace perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf waterwheel, is a small aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with small, white flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, allowing seeds to float and colonize new areas. Hydrophace perpusilla plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
