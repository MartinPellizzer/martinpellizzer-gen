    "intro": "Holodiscus saxicola, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Holodiscus saxicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens."
