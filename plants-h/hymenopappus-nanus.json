    "intro": "Hymenopappus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf hymenopappus, is a small annual herb native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact stature, typically growing to a height of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers in late spring. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. Hymenopappus nanus is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils."
