    "intro": "Hieracium nigrisrylum, commonly known as the black-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
