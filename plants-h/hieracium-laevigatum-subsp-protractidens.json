It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are narrowly lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is characterized by its slender stem and distinctive leaf morphology."
