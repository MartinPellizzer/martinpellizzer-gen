    "intro": "Haplopappus spinulosus subsp. glaberrimus, commonly known as the roughleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and sparsely hairy stems, which set it apart from other members of the species. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, facilitating wind pollination and seed dispersal."
