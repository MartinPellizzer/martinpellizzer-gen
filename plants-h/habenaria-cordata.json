It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit with a pseudobulb that supports its survival during dry periods. Its leaves are often heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and it produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The genus Habenaria is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a labellum that is often brightly colored and highly modified."
