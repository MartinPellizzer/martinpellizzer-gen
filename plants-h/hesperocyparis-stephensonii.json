    "intro": "Hesperocyparis stephensonii, commonly known as the Stephens' incense-cedar, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic foliage and reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain seeds, typical of the Cupressaceae family. Its leaves are scale-like and closely arranged, giving the tree a dense, compact appearance. This species is often found in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
