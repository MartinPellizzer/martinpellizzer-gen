    "intro": "Hydrosme seretii, commonly known as the water lily of Seret, is a rare aquatic plant found in the marshy regions of Southeast Asia. It has broad, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with a distinctive white and pink flower that blooms during the warmer months. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often near the edges of ponds and wetlands. Its root system helps stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in aquatic habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
