    "intro": "Hazardia enormidens, commonly known as the giant hazardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and bristly foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
