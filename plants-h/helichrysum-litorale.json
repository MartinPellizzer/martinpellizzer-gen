    "intro": "Helichrysum litorale, commonly known as coastal everlasting, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers, which are small and clustered in dense, rounded heads. The plant has silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to coastal and sandy habitats. Helichrysum litorale is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
