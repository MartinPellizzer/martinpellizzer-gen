    "intro": "Hemizonia paniculata subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the broad-leaved hemizonia, is a species native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive, often hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in paniculate inflorescences, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or open woodland habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
