    "intro": "Humata minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf humata, is a small flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Melastomataceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, clustered flowers. The plant typically features lance-shaped leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, star-shaped blossoms in shades of white and pink. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humata minuscula is considered a rare and endangered species."
