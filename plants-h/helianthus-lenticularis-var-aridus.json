    "intro": "Helianthus lenticularis var. aridus, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to harsh desert conditions. Its growth habit is typically low and sprawling, with stems that can reach up to 3 feet in length. This variety is valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
