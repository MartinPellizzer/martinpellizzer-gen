    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. wainioi, commonly known as the Wainio's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, with yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Native to specific regions of Europe, this subspecies is often found in grassy habitats and open areas. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
