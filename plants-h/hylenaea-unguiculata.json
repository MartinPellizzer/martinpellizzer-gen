    "intro": "Hylenaea unguiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Hylenaea unguiculata is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
