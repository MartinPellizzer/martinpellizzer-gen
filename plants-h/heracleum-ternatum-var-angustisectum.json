    "intro": "Heracleum ternatum var. angustisectum, commonly known as narrow-leaf hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often reddish-purple in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with narrow, elongated segments that give it its specific epithet. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
