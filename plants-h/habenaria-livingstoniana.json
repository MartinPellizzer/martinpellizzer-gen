    "intro": "Habenaria livingstoniana, commonly known as the Livingston's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow lips, typical of many Habenaria species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
