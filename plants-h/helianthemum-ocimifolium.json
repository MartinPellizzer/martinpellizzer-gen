    "intro": "Helianthemum ocimifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helianthemum ocimifolium is drought-tolerant and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
