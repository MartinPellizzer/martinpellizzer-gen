    "intro": "Hieracium trichocaulon, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
