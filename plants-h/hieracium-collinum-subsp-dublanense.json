    "intro": "Hieracium collinum subsp. dublanense, commonly known as the Dublan Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Eastern Mediterranean. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and arranged in a rosette or alternate pattern. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and is part of the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
