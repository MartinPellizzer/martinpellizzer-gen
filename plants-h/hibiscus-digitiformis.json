    "intro": "Hibiscus digitiformis, commonly known as the fingerleaf hibiscus, is a species native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its distinctive, digitate (finger-like) leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Hibiscus digitiformis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes in regions with mild winters."
