    "intro": "Hypericum exiguum, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It typically reaches a height of only a few inches, with small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value in rock gardens. Hypericum exiguum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than its larger relatives."
