    "intro": "Habracanthus putumayensis, commonly known as the Andean starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Onagraceae, which includes species such as willows and evening primroses. The plant is characterized by its star-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Habracanthus putumayensis is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its alpine habitat."
