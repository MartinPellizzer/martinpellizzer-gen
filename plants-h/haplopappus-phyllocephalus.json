    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplopappus phyllocephalus is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local pollinators."
