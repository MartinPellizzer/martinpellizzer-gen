    "intro": "Hieracium helenae, commonly known as Helen's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Helen's hawkweed is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
