    "intro": "Hoehnella, commonly known as the Mexican milkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to Mexico and are characterized by their showy, often orange or yellow flowers. Hoehnella species typically have milky sap, which is a common trait among plants in the Apocynaceae family. They are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value and others for their ecological importance to native pollinators."
