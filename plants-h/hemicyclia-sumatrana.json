    "intro": "Hemicyclia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Sumatra. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant produces cones, with male cones being cylindrical and female cones being more compact and woody. It thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is protected in its native range."
