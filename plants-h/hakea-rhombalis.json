    "intro": "Hakea rhombalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, red or yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal and semi-arid regions. Hakea rhombalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
