    "intro": "Hedysarum aucheri, commonly known as the Armenian bellflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features slender, upright stems that bear clusters of pink to lilac-colored flowers resembling small bells. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Hedysarum aucheri is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
