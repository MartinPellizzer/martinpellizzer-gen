    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cuneatum f. imbricata, commonly known as the imbricate shield fern, is a variant of the broad-leaved shield fern. It is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features narrow, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in a compact rosette. Its fronds are covered with a dense layer of fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety appearance. The spore-bearing structures, or sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family."
