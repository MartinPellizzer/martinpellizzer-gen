    "intro": "Hieracium fosnaense, commonly known as the Fosna hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets that are usually longer than the disk florets. Hieracium fosnaense is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat."
