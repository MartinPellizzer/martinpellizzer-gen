    "intro": "Hecistopteris pumila var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive, broad, and often lobed fronds. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that help it spread across moist soil. Its fronds are usually bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of pinnae and pinnules. This variety is notable for its adaptability to aquatic and semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
