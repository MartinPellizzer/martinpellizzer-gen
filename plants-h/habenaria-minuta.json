    "intro": "Habenaria minuta, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or mountainous regions. The plant has a slender, wiry stem with a single or few leaves, and its flowers are small, pale green to white, often with a slight purple hue. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its simple, sympodial growth habit. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
