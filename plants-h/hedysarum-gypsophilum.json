    "intro": "Hedysarum gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or sandy substrates. Its trifoliate leaves and stipitate stipules are typical of the Fabaceae family. Hedysarum gypsophilum plays a role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
