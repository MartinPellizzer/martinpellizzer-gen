    "intro": "Haplophyllum furfuraceum, commonly known as the hairy leaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy glands, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. It is typically found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Haplophyllum furfuraceum plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
