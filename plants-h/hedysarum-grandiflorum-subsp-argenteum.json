    "intro": "Hedysarum grandiflorum subsp. argenteum, commonly known as silver peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its silver-white, hairy foliage and clusters of pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its trifoliate leaves and erect, branching stems are typical of the Fabaceae family. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
