It belongs to the family Tortricidae, which includes many leaf-rolling moths. The larvae of this species are known to feed on various plants, including shrubs and trees, often rolling leaves to create shelters. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for these larvae, contributing to local biodiversity. Its life cycle and interactions with vegetation make it an interesting subject for ecological studies."
