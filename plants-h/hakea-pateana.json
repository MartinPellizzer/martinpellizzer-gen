    "intro": "Hakea pateana, commonly known as the Patean hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical branches and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hakea pateana is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common feature of coastal heathlands. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
