    "intro": "Hypolepis pteridioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypolepidae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically green and covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
