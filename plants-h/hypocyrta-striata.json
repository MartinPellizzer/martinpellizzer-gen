    "intro": "Hypocyrta striata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hypocyrta striata is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its hardy nature makes it a resilient species in woodland and scrub environments."
