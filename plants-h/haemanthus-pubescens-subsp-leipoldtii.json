    "intro": "Haemanthus pubescens subsp. leipoldtii, commonly known as the Leipoldt\u2019s haemanthus, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
