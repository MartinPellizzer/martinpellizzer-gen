    "intro": "Hakea repens, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, with woody stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically appearing in spring. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Hakea repens is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
