It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its semi-arid native environment."
