    "intro": "Helonias virginica, commonly known as the Virginia marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the eastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tall, erect flowering stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and other wetland habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
