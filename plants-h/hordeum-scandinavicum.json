It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces elongated, awned lemmas that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Hordeum scandinavicum is valued for its ecological role in supporting biodiversity and its historical use in traditional agriculture."
