    "intro": "Helichrysum setigerum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy texture. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, with the central disk being particularly prominent. Helichrysum setigerum is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
