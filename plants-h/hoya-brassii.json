    "intro": "Hoya brassii, commonly known as the Waffle Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often described as resembling waffles in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya brassii is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, and it thrives in bright, indirect light. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
