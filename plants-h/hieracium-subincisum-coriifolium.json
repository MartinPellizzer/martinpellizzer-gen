    "intro": "Hieracium subincisum coriifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, coriaceous (leathery) leaves that give it its specific epithet *coriifolium*. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is typically found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
