    "intro": "Hoya memoria, commonly known as the memory vine, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems and produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant's leaves are thick and leathery, often with a velvety texture, and are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Hoya memoria thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
