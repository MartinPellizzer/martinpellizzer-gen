It consists of several species, most notably Houlletia hirsuta, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. These plants are characterized by their large, palm-like leaves and showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. Houlletia species are often found in moist, shady habitats such as forests and riverbanks. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have traditional uses in some indigenous cultures."
