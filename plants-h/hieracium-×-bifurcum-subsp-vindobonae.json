    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. vindobonae, commonly known as the Vienna hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, composite flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
