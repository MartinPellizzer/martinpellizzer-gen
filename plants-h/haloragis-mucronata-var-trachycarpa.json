    "intro": "Haloragis mucronata var. trachycarpa, commonly known as the rough-seeded willowherb, is a flowering plant native to parts of Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or inland regions. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The variety trachycarpa is distinguished by its rough, ridged fruits, which are adapted for wind dispersal."
