    "intro": "Hakea kenneallyi, commonly known as the Cape York hakea, is a shrub native to the northern regions of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its unique, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to the arid and semi-arid climates of its native habitat. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hakea kenneallyi is also known for its ability to produce persistent, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals."
