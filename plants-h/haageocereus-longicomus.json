    "intro": "Haageocereus longicomus, commonly known as the long-stemmed night bloomer, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach several meters in height. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and striking floral display."
