It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and produces small, white or pale yellow blooms in the autumn season. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its roots are often used in traditional herbal medicine. Helenia autumnalis is valued not only for its ornamental qualities but also for its potential medicinal properties."
