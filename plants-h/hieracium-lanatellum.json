    "intro": "Hieracium lanatellum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has hairy, often woolly leaves and stems, which help to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, producing yellow to orange hues that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
