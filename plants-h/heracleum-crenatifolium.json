    "intro": "Heracleum crenatifolium, commonly known as the rough cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a biennial or perennial herb that can grow up to 2 meters tall, with large, serrated leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small white or greenish flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, which are followed by brown, dry fruits. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Due to its tall stature and distinctive appearance, it is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family."
