    "intro": "Hieracium erigescens, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium erigescens is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
