    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 derubellum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowering heads, which consist of numerous small tubular flowers surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe and parts of Asia. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
