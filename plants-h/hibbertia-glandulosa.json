The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, often appearing in late winter to early spring. It typically grows in heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Hibbertia glandulosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
