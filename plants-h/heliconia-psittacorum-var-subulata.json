    "intro": "Heliconia psittacorum var. subulata, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a bird's beak, with vivid red and yellow hues. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, bristly hairs. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding birds, making it an important component of tropical ecosystems. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a decorative plant in warm climates."
