    "intro": "Hypocistis kermesina, commonly known as the golden kermes, is a scale insect belonging to the family Kermesidae. It is native to regions of Europe and parts of Asia, where it infests various species of oak trees. The female adults are sessile and covered in a waxy, protective layer, while the males are mobile and have wings. The insect produces a sugary excretion called honeydew, which can lead to the growth of sooty mold on host plants. Hypocistis kermesina plays a role in both ecological interactions and has been studied for its potential in biological control."
