    "intro": "Hieracium setibifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to narrowly lanceolate, often with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are typically yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hieracium setibifidum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
