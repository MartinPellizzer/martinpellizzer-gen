It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with distinctive four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early summer. Its small, oval leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and the plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun.
