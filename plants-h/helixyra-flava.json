It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helixyra flava is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
