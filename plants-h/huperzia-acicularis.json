    "intro": "Huperzia acicularis, commonly known as the needle fern, is a species of clubmoss found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with long, slender, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a characteristic feature of many ferns. It is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in humid, forested areas. Huperzia acicularis is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded garden settings."
