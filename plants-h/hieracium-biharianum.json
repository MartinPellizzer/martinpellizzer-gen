    "intro": "Hieracium biharianum, commonly known as the Biharia hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, dry fruits called achenes. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
