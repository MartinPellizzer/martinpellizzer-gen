    "intro": "Hordeum murinum var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous mouse barley, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and hairy stems that often appear bluish-gray due to the presence of a waxy coating. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous two-rowed grains, which are typically pale yellow to brown in color. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. This variety is often found in grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields."
