    "intro": "Hedera sublutea, commonly known as the yellow ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green leaves, which are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along rocky outcrops. Hedera sublutea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to climb and cover structures in gardens."
