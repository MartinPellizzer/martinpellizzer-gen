    "intro": "Homalocephala polycephala subsp. xeranthemoides, commonly known as the desert star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun. This subspecies is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
