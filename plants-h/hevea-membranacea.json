    "intro": "Hevea membranacea, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and large, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been historically used for various industrial purposes. However, it is less commercially significant than other rubber-producing species."
