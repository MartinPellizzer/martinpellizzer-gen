    "intro": "Hymenophyllum eboracense, commonly known as the Yorkshire moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in temperate regions. The fronds are narrow, strap-shaped, and often have a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
