    "intro": "Hymenandra acutissima, commonly known as the sharp-pointed hymenandra, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, often with a distinct scent. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hymenandra acutissima is often found in shaded, moist forest understories where it thrives in humid conditions."
