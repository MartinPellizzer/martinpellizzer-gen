    "intro": "Hieracium alticeps, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium alticeps is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
