    "intro": "Hydrocotyle larranagii, commonly known as the Larranagii marsh penny, is a herbaceous plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its spreading growth habit and distinctive, palmate leaves. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and stream banks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels, and the plant is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hydrocotyle larranagii is also valued for its ornamental appeal in aquatic and bog gardens."
