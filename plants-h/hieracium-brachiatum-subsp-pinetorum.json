    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the pine forests of Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats within pine woodlands, often on well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers are borne in dense, flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, ovoid seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its native range, making it an important component of its forest ecosystem."
