    "intro": "Helleborine atropurpurea f. suboppositifolia, commonly known as the purple-flowered helleborine, is a rare orchid species characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and western Asia. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, and its flowers are typically borne on erect, leafless stems. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
