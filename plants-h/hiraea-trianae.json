    "intro": "Hiraea trianae, commonly known as the Tepuy cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged appearance. Hiraea trianae is adapted to grow in rocky, nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in high-altitude regions. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
