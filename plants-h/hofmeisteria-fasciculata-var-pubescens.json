It features small, scale-like leaves that are covered in fine, hairy structures, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, which are typically clustered at the tips of its stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. This variety is noted for its slow growth and is considered a rare and ancient plant species."
