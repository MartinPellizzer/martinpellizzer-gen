    "intro": "Herniaria pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean bladderwort, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Native to the Iberian Peninsula and the Pyrenees, it thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. The plant has a unique ability to store water in its leaves, which helps it survive in arid conditions. Its distribution is limited, making it a rare and specialized species in its native habitat."
