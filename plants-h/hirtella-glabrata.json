    "intro": "Hirtella glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features simple, elliptical leaves that are usually glabrous or only slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Hirtella glabrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
