    "intro": "Hedysarum polybotrys var. alaschanicum, commonly known as the Alaskan sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and parts of the Russian Far East. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, yellowish-green flower clusters that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
