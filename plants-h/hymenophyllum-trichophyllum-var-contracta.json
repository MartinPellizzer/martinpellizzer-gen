    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trichophyllum var. contracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lanceolate leaves with a serrated margin, and its fronds are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a dense, compact growth habit and produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical forest ecosystems."
