    "intro": "Hieracium flocciferum var. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white to pale yellow flower heads that resemble a cloud or a hawk's wing. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variant is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra."
