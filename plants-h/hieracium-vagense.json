    "intro": "Hieracium vagense, commonly known as the wandering hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Hieracium vagense is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
