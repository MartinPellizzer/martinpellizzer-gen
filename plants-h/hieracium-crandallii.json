    "intro": "Hieracium crandallii, commonly known as Crandall's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
