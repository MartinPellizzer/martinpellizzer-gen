    "intro": "Hypericum sherriffii, commonly known as Sherriff's St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. Its medicinal properties are derived from the presence of hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are bioactive compounds found in its flowers and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
