It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pinnatifidiforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many habitats."
