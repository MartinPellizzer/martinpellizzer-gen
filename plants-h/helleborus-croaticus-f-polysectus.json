It is characterized by its unique, deeply lobed leaves and striking, nodding flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant is native to specific regions in Croatia and is adapted to grow in shaded, moist woodland environments. Its foliage and flowers are often adorned with intricate patterns, enhancing its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
