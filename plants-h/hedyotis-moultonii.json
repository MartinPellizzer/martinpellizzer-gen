    "intro": "Hedyotis moultonii, commonly known as Moulton's pennywort, is a small herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and along stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that releases tiny seeds when mature. Hedyotis moultonii is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
