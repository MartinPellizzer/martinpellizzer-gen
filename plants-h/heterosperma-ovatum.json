    "intro": "Heterosperma ovatum, commonly known as the broadleaf water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, contributing to its ornamental value in ponds and water gardens. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, making it an effective indicator of water quality. Heterosperma ovatum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight."
