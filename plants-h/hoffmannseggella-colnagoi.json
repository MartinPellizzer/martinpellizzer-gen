It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in areas with limited sunlight. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
