    "intro": "Hemimeris coccinea, commonly known as the scarlet hibiscus, is a striking flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves, while the true flowers are small and yellow. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. Its leaves are ovate and glossy, with a smooth texture, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Hemimeris coccinea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its bold, colorful display."
