    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. veronense, commonly known as the yellow archangel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often hairy, and the leaves have translucent dots, a feature that gives it its scientific name \"perforatum.\" It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and meadows."
