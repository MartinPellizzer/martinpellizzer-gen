    "intro": "Hepatica americana f. cahnae, commonly known as the Cahnae hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully expand, making it a notable early indicator of the changing seasons. The f. cahnae form is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and flower structure compared to other hepatica varieties."
