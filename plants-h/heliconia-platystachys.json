    "intro": "Heliconia platystachys, commonly known as the broad-stemmed heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Heliconia platystachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
