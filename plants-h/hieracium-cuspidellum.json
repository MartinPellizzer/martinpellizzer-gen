    "intro": "Hieracium cuspidellum, commonly known as the sharp-tipped hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
