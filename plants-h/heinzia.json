    "intro": "Heinzia, commonly known as the heather or heinzia species, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their small, often evergreen leaves and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. Heinzia species are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Europe, Asia, and North America. They thrive in acidic, well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or sandy habitats. The flowers, which can range in color from white to pink and purple, are an important feature for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
