    "intro": "Helianthemum contortum, commonly known as the twisted rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has greyish-green, needle-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
