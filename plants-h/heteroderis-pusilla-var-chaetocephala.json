    "intro": "Heteroderis pusilla var. chaetocephala, commonly known as the small root knot nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Heteroderidae. It primarily infects the roots of a wide range of host plants, causing galls or knots to form as a result of its feeding activities. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, including egg, four juvenile stages, and an adult stage, with the second-stage juveniles being the infective stage. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in soil with high organic matter content. Due to its ability to cause significant damage to crops, it is a major concern in agricultural pest management."
