    "intro": "Heptapleurum obtusifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved stonecrop, is a species of flowering plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is native to parts of East Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan, where it typically grows in shaded, moist environments. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. It produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Heptapleurum obtusifolium is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
