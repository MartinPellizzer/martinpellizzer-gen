    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodollineri, commonly known as the Dolomite hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Eastern Alps. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium pseudodollineri is adapted to high-altitude conditions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
