    "intro": "Hieracium aurantellum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it has basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Hieracium aurantellum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
