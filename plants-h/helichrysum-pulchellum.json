    "intro": "Helichrysum pulchellum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, papery bracts give it a fluffy appearance, and it is often used in floral arrangements due to its longevity. Helichrysum pulchellum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
