    "intro": "Heuchera parviflora var. rugelii, commonly known as the Rugel's alumroot, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features attractive, mounded foliage that ranges from silver to deep red, depending on the variety and light conditions. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender stems above the foliage. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide color throughout the growing season."
