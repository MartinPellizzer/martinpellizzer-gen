    "intro": "Hieracium sericeum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets, and its leaves are typically hairy and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
