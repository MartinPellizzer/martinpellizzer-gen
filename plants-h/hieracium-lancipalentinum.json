    "intro": "Hieracium lancipalentinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
