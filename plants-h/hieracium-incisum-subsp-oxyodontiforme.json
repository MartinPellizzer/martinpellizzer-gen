    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. oxyodontiforme, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, serrated leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities."
