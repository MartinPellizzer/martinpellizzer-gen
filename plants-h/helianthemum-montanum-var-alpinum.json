    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine helianthemum, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
