    "intro": "Haplanthodes neilgherryensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its spiny stems and palmate leaves, which are adapted to its rocky and humid mountainous habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It is often found in dense undergrowth and is part of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
