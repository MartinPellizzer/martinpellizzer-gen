    "intro": "Hieracium thapsoides var. phlomidifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow disk flowers surrounded by narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. This variant is distinguished from other hawkweed species by its narrower foliage and specific floral morphology."
