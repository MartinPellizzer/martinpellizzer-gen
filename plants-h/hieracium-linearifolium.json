    "intro": "Hieracium linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads. Hieracium linearifolium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
