    "intro": "Hinterhubera harrietae, commonly known as the Harrieta's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the cloud forests of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals and a unique floral structure that resembles a ghostly apparition. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, making it highly dependent on ecological balance. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hinterhubera harrietae is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
