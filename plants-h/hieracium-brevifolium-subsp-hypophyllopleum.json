    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. hypophyllopleum, commonly known as the short-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the genus Hieracium. Its leaves are usually broad and slightly lobed, with a rough texture. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
