It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
