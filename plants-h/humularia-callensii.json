    "intro": "Humularia callensii, commonly known as the Callens' hummingbird vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in cymes, often attracting pollinators like bees and hummingbirds. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Humularia callensii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and unique growth habit."
