    "intro": "Hanseniella smitinandii, commonly known as the Smitinandii fern, is a rare and unique plant species belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a feature common among many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
