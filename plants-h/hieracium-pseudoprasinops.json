    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoprasinops, commonly known as the greenish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pseudoprasinops is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain regions."
