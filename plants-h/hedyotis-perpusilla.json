    "intro": "Hedyotis perpusilla, commonly known as the small dot spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. Hedyotis perpusilla is notable for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in M\u0101ori medicine."
