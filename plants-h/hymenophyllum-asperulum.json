    "intro": "Hymenophyllum asperulum, commonly known as the rough leathery fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often hairy fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the undersides of the fronds. Hymenophyllum asperulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and greenhouses."
