    "intro": "Hederorkis seychellensis, commonly known as the Seychelles sea hare, is a species of sea slug found in the coastal waters of the Seychelles. It belongs to the family Aeolidiidae and is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and vibrant coloration. The plant-like appearance of this organism is due to its ability to absorb and incorporate pigments from its environment, a feature known as chromatophore display. It feeds primarily on sponges and other marine invertebrates, using its radula to scrape food from surfaces. Hederorkis seychellensis plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to the trophic dynamics of its habitat."
