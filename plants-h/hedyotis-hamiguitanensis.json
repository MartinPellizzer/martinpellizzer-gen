    "intro": "Hedyotis hamiguitanensis, commonly known as the Hamiguitan geranium, is a flowering plant native to the Philippines, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Mindanao. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many ornamental and medicinal plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and its lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
