    "intro": "Humiria, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. Humiria species often grow in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The leaves are usually broad and heart-shaped, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
