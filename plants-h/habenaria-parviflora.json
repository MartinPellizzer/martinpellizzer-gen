    "intro": "Habenaria parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three petals and a distinctive lip. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short rhizome that helps anchor it in the soil. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
