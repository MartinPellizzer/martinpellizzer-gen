    "intro": "Hoya malata, commonly known as the Waffle Plant, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, waffle-like leaves that are dark green with a distinctive pattern of raised veins. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya malata thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its slow growth and air-purifying qualities make it both ornamental and beneficial for indoor environments."
