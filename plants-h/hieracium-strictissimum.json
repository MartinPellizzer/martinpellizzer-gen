It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium strictissimum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its extensive root system."
