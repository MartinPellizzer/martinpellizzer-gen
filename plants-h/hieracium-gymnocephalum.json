    "intro": "Hieracium gymnocephalum, commonly known as the naked-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its spread. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
