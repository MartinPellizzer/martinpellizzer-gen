    "intro": "Hyalocystis, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that are often blue or purple in color. These plants typically grow in coastal areas and are adapted to salty, windy environments. Hyalocystis species are often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal ecosystems."
