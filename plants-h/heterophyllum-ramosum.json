    "intro": "Heterophyllum ramosum, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, primarily small aquatic invertebrates. The plant has thin, branched stems and floating leaves that help it remain buoyant in water. Its flowers are typically small and greenish-white, appearing in clusters. Heterophyllum ramosum plays a role in its ecosystem by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling in aquatic habitats."
