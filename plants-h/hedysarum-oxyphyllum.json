It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a robust root system that helps in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable in soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its seeds are small and oval, typically dispersed by wind and animals."
