    "intro": "Hosackia leucophaea, commonly known as white prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hosackia leucophaea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
