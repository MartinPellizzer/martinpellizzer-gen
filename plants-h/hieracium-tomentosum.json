    "intro": "Hieracium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composed of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces seeds in a distinctive, flattened seed head. Hieracium tomentosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
