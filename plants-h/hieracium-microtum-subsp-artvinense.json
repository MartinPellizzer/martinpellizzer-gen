    "intro": "Hieracium microtum subsp. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
