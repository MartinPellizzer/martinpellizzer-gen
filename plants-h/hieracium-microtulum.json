    "intro": "Hieracium microtulum, commonly known as the small hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread vegetatively, it can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
