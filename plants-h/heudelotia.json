    "intro": "Heudelotia, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their alternate, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Heudelotia species typically grow in moist, well-drained soils and are often found in forest understories or along stream banks. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
