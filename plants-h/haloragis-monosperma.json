    "intro": "Haloragis monosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, linear leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or wet soils, often in estuaries and tidal zones. Its reproductive strategy involves producing a single seed per fruit, which is an adaptation to its specialized habitat. Haloragis monosperma plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and supporting local biodiversity."
