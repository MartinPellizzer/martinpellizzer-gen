    "intro": "Habenaria cualensis, commonly known as the Cual\u00e9n orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil, while its leaves are narrow and strap-like. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
