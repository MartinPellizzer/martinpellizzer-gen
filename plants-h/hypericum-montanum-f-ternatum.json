    "intro": "Hypericum montanum f. ternatum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
