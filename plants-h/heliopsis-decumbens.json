    "intro": "Heliopsis decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial that produces bright yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, silky hairs. Heliopsis decumbens is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinators."
