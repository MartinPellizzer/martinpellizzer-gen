    "intro": "Hydrangea serrata var. repens, commonly known as the climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that range from white to pink or blue, depending on soil pH. The plant has opposite, serrated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring to early summer, which develop into white or pink berries in the fall. This species is well-suited for climbing structures and can grow up to 30 feet in length, making it a popular ornamental plant."
