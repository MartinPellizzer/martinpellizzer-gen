    "intro": "Havilandia opaca, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the late summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an invasive species in some areas."
