    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. pseudopetiolatum, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish-green flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated petioles, which are longer than those of the typical H. nigrescens. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it adapts to cooler and more arid conditions."
