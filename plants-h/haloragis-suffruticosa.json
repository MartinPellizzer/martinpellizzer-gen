    "intro": "Haloragis suffruticosa, commonly known as the coastal flax or silver flax, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, often blooming in spring. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
