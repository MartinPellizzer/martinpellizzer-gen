    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. pallidiglaucinum, commonly known as the pale bluish-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are covered in a dense layer of pale blue or whitish hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture due to the presence of glandular hairs. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations."
