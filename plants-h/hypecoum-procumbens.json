    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens, commonly known as the spreading hellebore, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features basal rosettes of waxy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are known for their strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts flies rather than bees. Hypecoum procumbens is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun to partial shade conditions."
