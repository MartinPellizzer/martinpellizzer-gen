    "intro": "Hieracium angustatum subsp. amphiboloides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and finely divided leaves. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often associated with wetland or semi-aquatic environments."
