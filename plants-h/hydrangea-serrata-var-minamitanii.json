    "intro": "Hydrangea serrata var. minamitanii, commonly known as the Japanese mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental value make it a popular choice for smaller garden spaces. The flower color can vary depending on soil pH, with more acidic soils producing blue hues and alkaline soils resulting in pink tones."
