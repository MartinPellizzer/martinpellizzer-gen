    "intro": "Heliotropium romeroi, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, clustered flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, with five petals and a prominent central disk. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Heliotropium romeroi is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
