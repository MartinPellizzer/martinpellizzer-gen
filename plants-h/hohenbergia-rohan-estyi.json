    "intro": "Hohenbergia rohan-estyi, commonly known as the Esty's hohenbergia, is a species of bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and yellow flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in outdoor gardens in suitable climates."
