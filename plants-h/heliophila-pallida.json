    "intro": "Heliophila pallida, commonly known as the pale heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Heliophila pallida is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
