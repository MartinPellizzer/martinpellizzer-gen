    "intro": "Hieracium boreoapenninum, commonly known as the northern Apennine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dandelion-like composite flowers, which are typically yellow and surrounded by a pale green involucrum. The plant has serrated, hairy leaves that are basal and arranged in a rosette, with the stem becoming more upright as it matures. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
