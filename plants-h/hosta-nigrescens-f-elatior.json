    "intro": "Hosta nigrescens f. elatior, commonly known as the \"Black Knight\" hosta, is a variegated cultivar characterized by its striking dark green foliage with deep purple veins. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is native to the northeastern United States. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that grow in dense, mounded clumps, often reaching heights of 12 to 18 inches. It produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems in early summer, though the foliage is the primary ornamental feature. This variety thrives in shady, moist conditions and is prized for its dramatic color contrast."
