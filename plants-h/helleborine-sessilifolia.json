    "intro": "Helleborine sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, sessile leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces striking, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive, hood-like structure called the galea. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Helleborine sessilifolia is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations, which aid in nutrient absorption from the soil."
