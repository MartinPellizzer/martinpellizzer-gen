    "intro": "Hebeclinium jajoense, commonly known as the Jajo hebeclinium, is a rare plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
