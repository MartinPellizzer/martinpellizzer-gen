    "intro": "Helichrysum brachycladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are often clustered in heads, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum brachycladum is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
