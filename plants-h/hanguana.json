It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Hanguana is often found growing in rocky soils and can thrive with minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping and ornamental gardening."
