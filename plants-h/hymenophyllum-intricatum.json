It is a small, epiphytic plant that thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant's fronds are delicate and intricately veined, with a unique, lace-like appearance. Its sporangia are clustered in specialized structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum intricatum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to biodiversity and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
