    "intro": "Hieracium humidorifolium, commonly known as the wetland hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces, and its stems are often reddish in color. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in areas with consistently moist soil."
