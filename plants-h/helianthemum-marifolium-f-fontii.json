It features small, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are typical of the Cistaceae family. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
