    "intro": "Heliotropium vestitum, commonly known as the velvetleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils, often found in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its showy, violet-blue flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems, and they open in the morning, following the sun's movement. Heliotropium vestitum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
