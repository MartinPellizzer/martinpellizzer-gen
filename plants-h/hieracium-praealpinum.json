    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium praealpinum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
