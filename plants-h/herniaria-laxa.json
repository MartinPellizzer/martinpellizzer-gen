    "intro": "Herniaria laxa, commonly known as the common sand-stop, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to sandy coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dunes or coastal grasslands. Its unique ability to stabilize sand dunes makes it an ecologically important species in coastal ecosystems."
