    "intro": "Hieracium pimelophyllum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
