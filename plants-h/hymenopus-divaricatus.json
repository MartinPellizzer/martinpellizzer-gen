    "intro": "Hymenopus divaricatus, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread extensively across moist soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, greenish-white flowers that are wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a slightly hairy surface. Hymenopus divaricatus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
