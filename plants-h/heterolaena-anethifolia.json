It is characterized by its aromatic, anise-scented leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of anise. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, followed by small, fleshy fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its unique foliage and medicinal properties, it is of interest to botanists and herbalists alike."
