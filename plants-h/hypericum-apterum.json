    "intro": "Hypericum apterum, commonly known as the lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, woody stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum apterum is part of the Hippocastanaceae family and is known for its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
