    "intro": "Hierochloe repens, commonly known as mat grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It forms dense, mat-like clumps and has fine, hairless leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Hierochloe repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
