    "intro": "Hymenasplenium laterepens, commonly known as the broad-leafed spleenwort, is a member of the family Pterobryaceae and is a small, epiphytic liverwort. It typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions. The plant has a thallus that is dorsiventral, with a distinct upper and lower surface, and it produces gametes on specialized structures called gametophores. Its reproductive structures include antheridia and archegonia, which are located on separate shoots. Hymenasplenium laterepens is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that are often arranged in a rosette-like pattern."
