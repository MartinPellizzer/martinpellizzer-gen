    "intro": "Hippobroma longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered hippobroma, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, branching stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its most distinctive characteristic is its elongated, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hippobroma longiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
