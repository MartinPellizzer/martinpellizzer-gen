    "intro": "Helianthemum chamaecistus var. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for coastal and arid landscapes."
