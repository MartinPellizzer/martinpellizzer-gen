    "intro": "Hypoxis cavernicola, commonly known as the cave hypoxis, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often found growing in crevices or under rocks in shaded, humid microhabitats. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
