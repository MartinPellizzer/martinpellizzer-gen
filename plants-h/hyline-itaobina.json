    "intro": "Hyline itaobina, commonly known as the Itaobina hyline, is a rare flowering plant native to the dense rainforests of the Amazon Basin. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many toxic and ornamental plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from deep purple to bright red. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a glossy surface, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds enclosed in a gelatinous coating. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is rarely seen outside of its native region."
