    "intro": "Hieracium oblongatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets. Hieracium oblongatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
