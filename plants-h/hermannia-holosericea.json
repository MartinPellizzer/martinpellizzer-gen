It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange bracts that resemble flames, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-drained soil. Hermannia holosericea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and greenhouses."
