    "intro": "Histiopteris stipulacea var. stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical forests. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
