    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. eriocephaloides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver- or gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often in areas with strong winds and low temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species, often found in alpine meadows and mountain tundra."
