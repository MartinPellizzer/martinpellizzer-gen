    "intro": "Hierochloe pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and forest edges. The plant has slender, upright stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of loose, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-bearing flowers. Hierochloe pauciflora plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
