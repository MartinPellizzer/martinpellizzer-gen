It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. Native to the mountainous regions of southwest China, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Huperzia delavayi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
