    "intro": "Habenaria arenaria, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Australia and New Zealand. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as heathlands and coastal dunes. The plant produces slender, erect stems with a single or few flowers that are usually pale green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid environment. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in small colonies, making it a rare and ecologically significant plant."
