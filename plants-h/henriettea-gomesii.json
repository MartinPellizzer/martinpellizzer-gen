It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or blue in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are edible when ripe but contain toxic compounds when unripe. Henriettea gomesii thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
