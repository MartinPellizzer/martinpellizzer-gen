    "intro": "Hyacinthus orientalis subsp. chionophilus, commonly known as the snow-loving hyacinth, is a cold-hardy subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its blooming period typically occurs in late winter to early spring, adding early color to the garden. This subspecies is particularly valued for its ability to withstand colder temperatures compared to other hyacinth varieties."
