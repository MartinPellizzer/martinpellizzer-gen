    "intro": "Hemihabenaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow on trees rather than in soil. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its green, photosynthetic stems for nourishment. Hemihabenaria thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the canopy of longleaf pine forests. Due to its habitat specificity and declining population, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
