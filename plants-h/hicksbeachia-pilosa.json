    "intro": "Hicksbeachia pilosa, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Hicksbeachia pilosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
