    "intro": "Hoya pulchella, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or pink hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a subtle fragrance. Hoya pulchella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
