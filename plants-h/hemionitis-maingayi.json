    "intro": "Hemionitis maingayi, commonly known as the Maingay's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests or along stream banks. The plant has delicate, bipinnate fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds, a characteristic feature of the Hemionitaceae family. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered a threatened species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts for its survival."
