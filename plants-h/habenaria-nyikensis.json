    "intro": "Habenaria nyikensis, commonly known as the Nyik\u00e9nsis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, producing pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant features lanceolate leaves and produces elongated, fragrant flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
