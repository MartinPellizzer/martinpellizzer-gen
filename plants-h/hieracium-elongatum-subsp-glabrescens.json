    "intro": "Hieracium elongatum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with erect, branching stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with a dense layer of short, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
