It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves with a distinctive reddish or purplish underside, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and textural contrast."
