    "intro": "Hadrolaelia praestans, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to the high altitudes of South America. This perennial herb is characterized by its vibrant golden-yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. It features a sympodial growth habit with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchids. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its unique appearance and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts for its ornamental value."
