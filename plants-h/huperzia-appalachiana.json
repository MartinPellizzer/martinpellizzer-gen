It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores. Native to the eastern United States, particularly in forested areas of the Appalachian region, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically scale-like and arranged in whorls around the stem, contributing to its unique appearance.
