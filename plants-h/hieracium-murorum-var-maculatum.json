    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal rosettes of leaves and produces a taproot system, allowing it to thrive in disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This variant is distinguished by its distinctive reddish or purplish markings on the leaves, which give it its common name."
