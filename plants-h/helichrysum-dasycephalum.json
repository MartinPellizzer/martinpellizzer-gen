    "intro": "Helichrysum dasycephalum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, which has made it popular in floral arrangements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its hardy nature and visual interest."
