    "intro": "Huperzia phelpsii, commonly known as the Phleps' clubmoss, is a species of tropical fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, club-shaped sporophylls that bear spores. Native to the humid forests of Central and South America, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a ground cover in forest ecosystems. The plant exhibits a unique reproductive strategy, with spores dispersed by wind, contributing to its survival in diverse habitats."
