    "intro": "Harrisia, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. These plants are characterized by their spiny stems and large, showy flowers that typically open at night. The flowers are usually white or pale in color and emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators. Harrisia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and unique blooming habits. They thrive in well-draining soil and require minimal water, making them suitable for arid environments."
