    "intro": "Helianthemum levipes, commonly known as the creeping sunflower or stonecress, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows on rocky or sandy soils, often in sunny, well-drained areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
