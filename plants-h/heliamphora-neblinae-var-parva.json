    "intro": "Heliamphora neblinae var. parva, commonly known as the dwarf marsh pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its small, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete digestive enzymes to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Its compact size makes it well-suited for cultivation in small containers. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is a popular choice among carnivorous plant enthusiasts."
