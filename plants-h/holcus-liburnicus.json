    "intro": "Holcus liburnicus, commonly known as sheep's barley, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually bluish-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle of spikelets, which produce small, wind-pollinated flowers. Holcus liburnicus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
