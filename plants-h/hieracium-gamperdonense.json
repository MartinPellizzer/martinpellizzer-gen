    "intro": "Hieracium gamperdonense, commonly known as the Gamperdon hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
