    "intro": "Haemanthus cyrtanthiflorus, commonly known as the Natal grassblume, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences with bright red flowers. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. It blooms during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
