    "intro": "Hypolepis spectabilis, commonly known as the sword fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its large, lance-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinctive, often recurved shape. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and wiry, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a glossy, dark green appearance that makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
