    "intro": "Hepatica americana f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves and showy, early spring blooms. The flowers are typically purple or blue with five sepals that resemble petals, and they appear before the leaves fully unfold. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in shaded, rich soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for early pollinators."
