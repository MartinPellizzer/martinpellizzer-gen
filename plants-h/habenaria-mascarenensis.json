    "intro": "Habenaria mascarenensis, commonly known as the Mascarene orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in coastal or forested areas. It is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
