    "intro": "Hilliella rhombea, commonly known as the mountain bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh climates. Hilliella rhombea is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
