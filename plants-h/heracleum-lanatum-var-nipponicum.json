    "intro": "Heracleum lanatum var. nipponicum, commonly known as Japanese cow parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem that can grow up to 2 meters in height, often with a distinctive purple or reddish tinge. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly lobed, with a coarse texture and a strong, often unpleasant odor. The plant is known for its toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, and is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks."
