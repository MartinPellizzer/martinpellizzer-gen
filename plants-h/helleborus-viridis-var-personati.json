It is characterized by its broad, waxy, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of white or pale green flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short, sturdy stalks. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soils. This variety is noted for its cold hardiness and ability to naturalize in woodland gardens."
