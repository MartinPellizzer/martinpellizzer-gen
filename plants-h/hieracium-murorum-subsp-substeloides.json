It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in compact clusters. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. It has a hairy stem and is typically short-lived, completing its life cycle within one growing season. The subspecies substeloides is distinguished by its more compact growth form and smaller leaves compared to other members of the species."
