    "intro": "Hieracium subincisum, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed or incised, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens."
