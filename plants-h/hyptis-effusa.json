It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Hyptis effusa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
