    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. tenuistolonum, commonly known as the slender-stoloniferous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stolons that help it spread vegetatively. The species is often found in sunny, well-drained soils and is relatively drought-tolerant."
