    "intro": "Hieracium glossolbium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium glossolbium is also known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments."
