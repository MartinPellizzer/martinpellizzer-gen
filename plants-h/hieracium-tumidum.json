    "intro": "Hieracium tumidum, commonly known as the swollen hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive swollen base, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium tumidum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
