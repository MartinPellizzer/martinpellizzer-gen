    "intro": "Helianthemum viscarium, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its stems are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or coastal habitats."
