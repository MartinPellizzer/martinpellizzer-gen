It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding vibrant color to its arid habitat. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
