    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. trimmisense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. It is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings but plays a role in local ecosystems."
