    "intro": "Helichrysum globosum var. globosum, commonly known as the Globe everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, spherical shape and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny globes. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to retain color for extended periods."
