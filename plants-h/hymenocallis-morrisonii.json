    "intro": "Hymenocallis morrisonii, commonly known as the Morrison's spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to Mexico. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive spidery appearance. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and relatively low maintenance requirements."
