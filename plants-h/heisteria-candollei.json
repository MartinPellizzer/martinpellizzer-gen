    "intro": "Heisteria candollei, commonly known as the candolle's heisteria, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Primulaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink, typically during the spring and summer months. Heisteria candollei thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
