    "intro": "Homalobus woodruffii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the milkweed family (Asclepiadaceae) and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including mammals and birds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Homalobus woodruffii plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly certain species of butterflies."
