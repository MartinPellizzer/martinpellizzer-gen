    "intro": "Hieracium saxatile var. stupposum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variant is distinguished by its more compact growth form and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
