    "intro": "Helianthemum laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry slopes. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
