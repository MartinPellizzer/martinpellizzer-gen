    "intro": "Hieracium camkorijense subsp. onosmaceum, commonly known as the Karakoram hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
