    "intro": "Hemionitis fragillima, commonly known as the fragile hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of western China. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, finely divided leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This plant thrives in harsh, rocky environments where it can tolerate extreme temperature fluctuations and low moisture levels. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing clusters, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hemionitis fragillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
