    "intro": "Hypericum radicans, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are opposite on the stems and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
