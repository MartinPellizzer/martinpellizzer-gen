    "intro": "Hoya juhoneweana, commonly known as the Starry Wax Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Hoya juhoneweana is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
