    "intro": "Hieracium pangaeum, commonly known as the Pacific hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
