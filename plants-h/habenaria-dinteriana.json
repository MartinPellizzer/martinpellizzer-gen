    "intro": "Habenaria dinteriana, commonly known as the Dinter's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and produces a single, erect stem bearing a few lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its distinctive, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange with reddish markings. It blooms in late winter to early spring, and its growth is often associated with specific soil types and microclimates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
