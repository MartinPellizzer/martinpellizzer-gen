    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tripartita var. hydrophila, commonly known as water pennywort, is a aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, trifoliate leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the substrate in shallow water bodies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which aid in gas exchange and reduce water loss. It is commonly found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
