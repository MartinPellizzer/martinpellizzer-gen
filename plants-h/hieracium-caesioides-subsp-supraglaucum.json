    "intro": "Hieracium caesioides subsp. supraglaucum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. It produces small, dandelion-like composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Its subspecies designation reflects subtle differences in leaf and stem morphology compared to other hieracium species."
