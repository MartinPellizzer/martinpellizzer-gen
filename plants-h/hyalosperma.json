These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, translucent seeds that resemble glass. Hyalosperma species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, often found in dry, sandy soils. They produce small, white or pink flowers and have aromatic leaves. The genus is notable for its ecological importance in arid and semi-arid regions of Australia."
