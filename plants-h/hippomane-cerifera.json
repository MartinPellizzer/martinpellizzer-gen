    "intro": "Hippomane cerifera, commonly known as the rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and produces a milky latex sap that is used to make natural rubber. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its growth habit includes a tall, woody stem with broad, palmate leaves that can reach several feet in length. The rubber tree is an important species in both ecological and industrial contexts due to its latex production."
