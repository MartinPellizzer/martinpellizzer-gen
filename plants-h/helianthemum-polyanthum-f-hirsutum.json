    "intro": "Helianthemum polyanthum f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with woody stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its hairy leaves and stems are adaptations to its arid and rocky habitats. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
