    "intro": "Hoya parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth, glossy surface and a slight waxy coating. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
