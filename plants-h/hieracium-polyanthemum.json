    "intro": "Hieracium polyanthemum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
