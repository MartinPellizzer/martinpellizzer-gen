    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. semisilvaticum, commonly known as the wood hedgehog, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, glandular stems and leaves with a rough, hairy texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to more woodland conditions compared to the typical H. murorum."
