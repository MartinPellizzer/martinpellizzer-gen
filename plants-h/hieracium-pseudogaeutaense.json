    "intro": "Hieracium pseudogaeutaense, commonly known as the Gaeutal hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
