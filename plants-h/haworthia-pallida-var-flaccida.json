    "intro": "Haworthia pallida var. flaccida, commonly known as the pale haworthia or flaccid haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth pattern and fleshy, pale green to blue-gray leaves that are often adorned with white or pale markings. The leaves are typically shorter and more elongated compared to other Haworthia species, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
