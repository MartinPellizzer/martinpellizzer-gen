It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
