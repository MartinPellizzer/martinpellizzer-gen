    "intro": "Heliophila pusilla, commonly known as small heliophytes, is a small flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Heliophila pusilla thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and ditches. Its delicate appearance and ecological importance make it a valuable component of wetland ecosystems."
