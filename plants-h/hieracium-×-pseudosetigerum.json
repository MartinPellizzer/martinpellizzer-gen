    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pseudosetigerum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellow to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium auripigmentum. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in studies on plant hybridization and ecological adaptation."
