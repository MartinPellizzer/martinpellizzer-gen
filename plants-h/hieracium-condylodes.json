    "intro": "Hieracium condylodes, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Hieracium condylodes is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
