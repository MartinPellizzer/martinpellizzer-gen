It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at higher altitudes. This subspecies is noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
