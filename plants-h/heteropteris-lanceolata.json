    "intro": "Heteropteris lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. The fronds are usually evergreen, with a smooth, dark green surface and a leathery texture."
