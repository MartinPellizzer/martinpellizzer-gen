    "intro": "Hieracium subspeciosum subsp. melanophaeum, commonly known as the dark-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and yellowish to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a basal rosette of leaves with hairy surfaces, and its stems are usually unbranched. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker foliage compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
