    "intro": "Halesia diptera, commonly known as the white beech, is a deciduous tree native to eastern Asia, particularly China and Japan. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, oval berries that are edible for some bird species but not for humans. Halesia diptera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in temperate climates."
