    "intro": "Hoffmannseggella liliputana, commonly known as the dwarf dandelion, is a small flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its delicate, yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow it to colonize new areas easily. Due to its small size and widespread distribution, it is often overlooked but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
