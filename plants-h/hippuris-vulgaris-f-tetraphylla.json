    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris f. tetraphylla, commonly known as the four-leaf water plantain, is a variant of the water plantain characterized by its distinctive four-leaf structure. This subspecies is typically found in shallow, still waters such as ponds and wetlands, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, muddy substrates. Its leaves are broad, floating, and often have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikes, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
