    "intro": "Heteradelphia paulojaegeria, commonly known as the Brazilian water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to South America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant has broad, floating leaves that are usually green with a waxy surface, and it produces white or pink flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in the substrate while absorbing nutrients from the water. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate varying water conditions and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
