    "intro": "Heliotropium laxiflorum, commonly known as the laxiflorous heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, pink or violet flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its flowers open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism, which aids in pollination. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
