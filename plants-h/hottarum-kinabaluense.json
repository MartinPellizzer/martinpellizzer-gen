    "intro": "Hottarum kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu star orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that display a combination of white and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid microclimates and is often found growing on tree trunks or among moss-covered rocks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and limited natural propagation, it is considered a vulnerable species."
