    "intro": "Humea gracillima, commonly known as the slender Humea, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes many epiphytic and lithophytic species. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of microscopic scales. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Humea gracillima is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
