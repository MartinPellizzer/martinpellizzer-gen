    "intro": "Haplolobus glandulosus, commonly known as the sticky false heather, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving the plant its characteristic sticky texture. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands or rocky areas. The plant is noted for its ability to tolerate drought and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance."
