    "intro": "Haworthia reticulata var. subregularis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's pattern. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden displays."
