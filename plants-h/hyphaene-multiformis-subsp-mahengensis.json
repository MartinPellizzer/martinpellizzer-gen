    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. mahengensis, commonly known as the Maheng palm, is a species native to Madagascar. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants. The plant produces large, fan-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional crafts. Its inflorescences are clustered and can be quite showy, attracting various pollinators. The fruit is a fibrous, spiky structure that develops from the flowers and is an important food source for local wildlife."
