    "intro": "Hieracium conspurcans, commonly known as the stinking hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium conspurcans is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
