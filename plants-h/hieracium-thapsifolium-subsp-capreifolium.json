    "intro": "Hieracium thapsifolium subsp. capreifolium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in high-altitude environments where few other plants can survive."
