    "intro": "Helia amoena, commonly known as the golden sunflower, is a striking plant native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, bright yellow ray flowers that surround a central disk of smaller, dark orange florets. The plant produces slender, woody stems that can grow up to three meters in height, often branching out to form a bushy structure. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Helia amoena is well adapted to hot, dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
