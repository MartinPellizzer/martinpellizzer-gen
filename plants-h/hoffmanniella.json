    "intro": "Hoffmanniella, commonly known as the rock violet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, particularly in the Mediterranean region and parts of southern Europe. The plants are characterized by their small, showy flowers that often have a distinctive blue or violet hue. They usually grow as low-growing shrubs or herbs with hairy stems and leaves. Hoffmanniella species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate blooms."
