    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. aspreticola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and produces numerous small, daisy-like flowers from June to August. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
