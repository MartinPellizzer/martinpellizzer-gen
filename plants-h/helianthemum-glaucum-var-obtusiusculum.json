    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. obtusiusculum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in the spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
