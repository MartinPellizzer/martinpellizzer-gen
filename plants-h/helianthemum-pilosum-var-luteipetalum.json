It features small, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
