    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. sylvularum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas, preferring rich, loamy soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
