    "intro": "Helianthemum laevipes, commonly known as the rough stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe and northern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
