It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves and its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadside areas. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its spread across various habitats. The species is often found in open, sunny environments where it can compete effectively with other grasses and herbs."
