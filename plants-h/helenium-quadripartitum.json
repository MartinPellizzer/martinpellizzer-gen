    "intro": "Helenium quadripartitum, commonly known as the four-parted sneezeweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, daisy-like blooms. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical features include a robust root system and fibrous stems, which help it thrive in moist, well-drained soils. Helenium quadripartitum is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
