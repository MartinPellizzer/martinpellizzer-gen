It is a low-growing annual herb with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields and along roadsides. Hyoseris frutescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
