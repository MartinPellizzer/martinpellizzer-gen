    "intro": "Helleborine rubiginosa, commonly known as the spotted helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, pleated leaves and striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Helleborine rubiginosa is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora."
