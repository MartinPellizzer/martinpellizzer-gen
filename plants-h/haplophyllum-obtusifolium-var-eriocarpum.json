    "intro": "Haplophyllum obtusifolium var. eriocarpum, commonly known as the woolly bladder-leaf, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its thick, succulent leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a bladder-like capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
