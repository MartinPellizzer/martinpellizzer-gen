    "intro": "Hieracium inuloides subsp. pseudostriatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
