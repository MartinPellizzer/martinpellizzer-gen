    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among members of its family. Hymenophyllum dusenii is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in humid, high-altitude habitats."
