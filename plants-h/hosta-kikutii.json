    "intro": "Hosta kikutii, commonly known as the Japanese hosta, is a perennial plant native to Japan. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and yellow margins. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Hosta kikutii prefers partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
