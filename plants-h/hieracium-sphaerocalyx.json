    "intro": "Hieracium sphaerocalyx, commonly known as the globe hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellow flowers in late summer. The plant produces small, spherical flower heads that are surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
