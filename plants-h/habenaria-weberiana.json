    "intro": "Habenaria weberiana, commonly known as the Weber's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the undergrowth where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
