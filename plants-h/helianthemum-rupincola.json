    "intro": "Helianthemum rupincola, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum rupincola thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone-rich habitats."
