    "intro": "Hieracium obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly ovate, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various conditions."
