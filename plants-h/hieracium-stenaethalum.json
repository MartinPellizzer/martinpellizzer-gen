It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purple hues. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
