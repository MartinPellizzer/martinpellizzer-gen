    "intro": "Hippocastanum levigatum, commonly known as the velvet tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hippocastanaceae. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and ornamental leaves that turn a striking red in the fall. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late spring, followed by spiny capsules containing glossy, edible seeds. It is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
