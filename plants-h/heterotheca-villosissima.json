It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Heterotheca villosissima produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
