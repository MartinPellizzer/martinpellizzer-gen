    "intro": "Habenaria medusa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and captivating orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, bell-shaped flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
