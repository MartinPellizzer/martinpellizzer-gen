    "intro": "Hedysarum rufescens, commonly known as redstem milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by cylindrical, bean-like pods. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum rufescens is valued for its ability to thrive in arid conditions and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
