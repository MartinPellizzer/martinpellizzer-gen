    "intro": "Hemionitis calidirupium, commonly known as the hot rock fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of China. It thrives in rocky, arid environments and is adapted to high temperatures and low humidity. The plant has a compact, cushion-like growth form with small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss. Its spores are released in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is typically found on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
