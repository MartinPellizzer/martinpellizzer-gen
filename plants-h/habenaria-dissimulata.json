    "intro": "Habenaria dissimulata, commonly known as the hidden lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and a long, spiraled inflorescence bearing numerous small, white to pale purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors and rock crevices. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, dark brown seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
