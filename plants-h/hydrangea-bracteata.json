    "intro": "Hydrangea bracteata, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink or blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in cone-like structures called corymbs. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a glossy surface. Hydrangea bracteata thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
