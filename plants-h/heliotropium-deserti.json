    "intro": "Heliotropium deserti, commonly known as desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves adapted to conserve water in hot, dry environments. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium deserti plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and provides nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
