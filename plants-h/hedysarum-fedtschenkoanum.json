    "intro": "Hedysarum fedtschenkoanum, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
