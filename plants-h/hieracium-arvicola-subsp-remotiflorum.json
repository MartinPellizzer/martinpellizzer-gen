    "intro": "Hieracium arvicola subsp. remotiflorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, characterized by its low stature and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated flower head with ray florets, which are often sterile. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
