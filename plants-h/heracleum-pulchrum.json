    "intro": "Heracleum pulchrum, commonly known as the beautiful hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by oval, dry fruits. It is important to note that while not as toxic as its relative, giant hogweed, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with its sap."
