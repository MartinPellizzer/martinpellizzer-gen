    "intro": "Hieracium, commonly known as hawkweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers, which consist of ray florets and disk florets. Hieracium species are typically herbaceous, with upright or spreading growth habits, and they often have hairy stems and leaves. They are found in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. Many species are invasive in non-native areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to their rapid growth and prolific seed production."
