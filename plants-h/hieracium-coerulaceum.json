    "intro": "Hieracium coerulaceum, commonly known as blue hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its blue to purple flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium coerulaceum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes be considered an invasive species in non-native habitats."
