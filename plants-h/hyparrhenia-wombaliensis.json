    "intro": "Hyparrhenia wombaliensis, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green or reddish in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hyparrhenia wombaliensis is valued for its ornamental use and its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
