    "intro": "Hieracium proclivium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous small, yellowish to reddish flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Hieracium proclivium is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and extensive root system."
