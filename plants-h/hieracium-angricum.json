    "intro": "Hieracium angricum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It has been introduced to other regions and is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
