    "intro": "Hispidella hispanica f. tubuliflora, commonly known as the tubular-flowered hispidella, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
