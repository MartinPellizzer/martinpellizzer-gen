    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium var. venustum, commonly known as the showy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are often more showy than those of the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh growing conditions."
