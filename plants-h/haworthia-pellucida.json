    "intro": "Haworthia pellucida, commonly known as the glassy Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of pale green, translucent leaves that often appear glass-like due to their waxy coating. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers on short, upright stems during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
