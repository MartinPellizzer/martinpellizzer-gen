    "intro": "Hieracium grandescens, commonly known as the greater hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from June to September. Hieracium grandescens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
