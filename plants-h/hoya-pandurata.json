    "intro": "Hoya pandurata, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in response to changes in light and temperature. Hoya pandurata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
