    "intro": "Helenium nervosum, commonly known as the nervous helenium, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and showy, ray-like petals. The plant typically grows in wetlands and marshy areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its bright orange to red flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helenium nervosum is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological importance and adaptability to aquatic environments."
