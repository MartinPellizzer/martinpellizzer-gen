    "intro": "Hymenochilus wapstrarum, commonly known as the Wapstara orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, greenish-white to pale yellow blossoms with a distinctive lip that is often more brightly colored. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in the orchid world."
