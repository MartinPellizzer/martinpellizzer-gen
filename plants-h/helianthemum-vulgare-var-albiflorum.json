    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. It is closely related to other species in the genus Helianthemum, which are commonly referred to as rock roses. The white flowers of this variety distinguish it from the more commonly seen orange or yellow-flowered forms of the same species."
