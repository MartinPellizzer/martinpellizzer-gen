It typically grows in rocky or dry habitats, such as slopes and gravelly soils. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. It is often found in open, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
