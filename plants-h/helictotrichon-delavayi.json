    "intro": "Helictotrichon delavayi, commonly known as Delavay's goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Tibetan Plateau. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in alpine environments with cool, moist conditions. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude habitats. Helictotrichon delavayi is often found in meadows and rocky slopes, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
