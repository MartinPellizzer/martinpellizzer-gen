    "intro": "Helianthemum viscidum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps deter herbivores. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
