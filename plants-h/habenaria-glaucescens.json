    "intro": "Habenaria glaucescens, commonly known as the blue ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers emit a faint, sweet fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of beetles. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable and is often protected in conservation programs."
