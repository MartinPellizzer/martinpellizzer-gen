    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. argillaceum, commonly known as the clay hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils, often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with serrated edges, and produces small, yellowish flower heads in the summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and can reach heights of up to 50 cm. The species is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its distinctive leaf morphology."
