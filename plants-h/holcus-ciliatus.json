    "intro": "Holcus ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along streambanks. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions outside its native range."
