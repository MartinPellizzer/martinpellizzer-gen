    "intro": "Hieracium ceramotum, commonly known as the Ceramotum hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky areas. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
