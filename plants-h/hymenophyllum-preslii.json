    "intro": "Hymenophyllum preslii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are typically covered in a fine layer of silvery scales, giving it its common name. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and closely spaced, forming a dense, carpet-like structure. Hymenophyllum preslii is known for its high degree of vascular complexity and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
