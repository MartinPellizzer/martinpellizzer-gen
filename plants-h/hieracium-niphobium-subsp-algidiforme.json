    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. algidiforme, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal rosettes of dark green, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it well-suited for survival in harsh alpine conditions."
