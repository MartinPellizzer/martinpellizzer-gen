It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas and has small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers in early spring, and its stems are often prostrate or ascending. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Houstonia species."
