It is a perennial plant characterized by its tall, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers at the end of its stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
