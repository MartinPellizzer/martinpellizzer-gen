    "intro": "Hieracium foliolaceum, commonly known as the leafy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often damp habitat. Its flowers bloom from June to September, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
