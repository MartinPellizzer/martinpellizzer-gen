    "intro": "Hydrocotyle flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces tiny, bladder-like fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Hydrocotyle flexuosa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
