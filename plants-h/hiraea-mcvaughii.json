    "intro": "Hiraea mcvaughii, commonly known as the McVaugh's hiraea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and nutrient-poor soils. Its small, yellow flowers are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
