    "intro": "Hartwegia nimmonii, commonly known as the Nimmon's hartwegia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palm-like appearance, with large, spirally arranged leaves that can reach up to two meters in height. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with five petals and stamen, and it produces woody fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hartwegia nimmonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
