It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind.
