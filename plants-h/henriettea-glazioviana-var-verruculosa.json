    "intro": "Henriettea glazioviana var. verruculosa, commonly known as the Glaziov's henriettea, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its unique floral structures. The plant features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate with a hairy texture, and the stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
