    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum var. diversifloccum, commonly known as the diverse flocculent hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are accompanied by bracts that are often more prominent than the actual flowers. This variant is distinguished by its variable flocculence, which refers to the fluffy, woolly appearance of its bracts."
