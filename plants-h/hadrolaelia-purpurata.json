    "intro": "Hadrolaelia purpurata, commonly known as the purple orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, dark green leaves that help it store water in its native arid environment. It thrives in cool, shaded conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its beauty and rarity, it is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
