    "intro": "Hymenoclea sandersonii, commonly known as the sanderson's bladder nut, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces distinctive bladder-like fruits that encase its seeds, a feature that aids in seed dispersal. Its leaves are typically ovate with a velvety texture, and it blooms with yellow flowers. Hymenoclea sandersonii is often found in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in wetlands."
