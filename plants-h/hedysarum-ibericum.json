    "intro": "Hedysarum ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Hedysarum ibericum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
