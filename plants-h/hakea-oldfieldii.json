    "intro": "Hakea oldfieldii, commonly known as Oldfield's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching growth habit and its distinctive, woody, cone-like inflorescences. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Hakea oldfieldii is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
