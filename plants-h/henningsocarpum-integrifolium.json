    "intro": "Henningsocarpum integrifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leafed henningsocarp, is a rare member of the Rubiaceae family native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its slender stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round fruits that contain a single seed. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
