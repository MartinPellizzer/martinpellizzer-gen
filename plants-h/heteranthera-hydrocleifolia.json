    "intro": "Heteranthera hydrocleifolia, commonly known as water thyme, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features small, bright green leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread quickly, making it both a valuable aquatic plant and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
