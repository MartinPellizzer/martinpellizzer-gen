    "intro": "Hirculus confertifolius, commonly known as the dense-leaved hirculus, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has woody stems that become more branched with age, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitats."
