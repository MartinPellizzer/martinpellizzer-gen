It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, grass-like leaves that are often marked with striking white or yellow stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant typically grows in compact rosettes and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It requires minimal water and thrives in bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
