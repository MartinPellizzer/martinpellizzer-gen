    "intro": "Hieracium laggeri subsp. verguinii, commonly known as the Verguin's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in open areas with limited competition. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
