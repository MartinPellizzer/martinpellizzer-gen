    "intro": "Hieracium eurynotum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow-orange flowers from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium eurynotum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a valuable plant in ecological studies."
