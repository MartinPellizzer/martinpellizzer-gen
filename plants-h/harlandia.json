    "intro": "Harlandia, commonly known as the \"false arum,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants typically have large, showy leaves and distinctive spadices, which are the modified inflorescences that house the small, inconspicuous flowers. Harlandia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking foliage and unique floral structures. They prefer moist, well-drained soils and thrive in shaded to partially shaded environments."
