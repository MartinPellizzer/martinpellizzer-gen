It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. The plant is often found in sunny, open habitats and is known for its ability to colonize areas quickly."
