    "intro": "Hymenophyllum brachypus, commonly known as the broad-leafed filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are narrow, elongated, and covered with a dense layer of rhizoids that help in water absorption. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and indirect light."
