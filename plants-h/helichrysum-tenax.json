    "intro": "Helichrysum tenax, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, golden-yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, giving it a daisy-like appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry climates. Helichrysum tenax is often used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, dried floral form."
