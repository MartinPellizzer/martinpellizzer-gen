    "intro": "Hieracium nivaense, commonly known as the snow cinquefoil, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head and are surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium nivaense is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
