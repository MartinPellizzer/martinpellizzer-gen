    "intro": "Habenaria gibsonii var. foetida, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat needs, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation and study."
