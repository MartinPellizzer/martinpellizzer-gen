    "intro": "Hieracium pravum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. Hieracium pravum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
