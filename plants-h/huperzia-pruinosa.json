    "intro": "Huperzia pruinosa, commonly known as the silver fern, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that often appears silvery due to a waxy coating on its leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its structure consists of rhizomes and erect, branched shoots with small, scale-like leaves. Huperzia pruinosa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, attractive ground covers."
