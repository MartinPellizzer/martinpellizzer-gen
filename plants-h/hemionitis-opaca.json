    "intro": "Hemionitis opaca, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to the eastern United States. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands, where it attaches itself to submerged rocks or logs. The plant has a delicate, feathery appearance with small, lance-shaped fronds that are often translucent, giving it its ghostly nickname. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hemionitis opaca plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
