    "intro": "Hydrophyllum tenuipes var. viride, commonly known as greenleaf false nettle, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its finely toothed, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a bright green color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its wetland habitat, with rhizomes that help it spread and survive in saturated soils."
