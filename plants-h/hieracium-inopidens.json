It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium inopidens is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments."
