    "intro": "Hypecoum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a robust, upright stem with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hypecoum alpinum is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and visually appealing addition to alpine gardens."
