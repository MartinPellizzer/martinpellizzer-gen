    "intro": "Herniaria berlengiana, commonly known as the Berlingian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the rocky shores of the Azores. It thrives in coastal environments, characterized by its ability to tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters and blooming during the summer months. Herniaria berlengiana plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
