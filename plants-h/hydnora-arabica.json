    "intro": "Hydnora arabica, commonly known as the desert candle, is a parasitic plant found primarily in arid regions of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing within the stems of other plants. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a candle, which serves as a specialized flower. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators such as flies. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, Hydnora arabica is a rare and ecologically significant species."
