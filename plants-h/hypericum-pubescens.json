    "intro": "Hypericum pubescens, commonly known as the sticky St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features woody stems covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine pubescence. Hypericum pubescens is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
