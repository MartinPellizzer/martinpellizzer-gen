    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense, commonly known as the Reti\u017eat Alpine Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, flattened shape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
