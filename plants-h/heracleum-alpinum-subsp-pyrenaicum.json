It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, preferring moist, calcareous soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in complex clusters, and it produces distinctive, elongated fruits. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential as a medicinal plant."
