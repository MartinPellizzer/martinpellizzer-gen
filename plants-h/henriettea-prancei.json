    "intro": "Henriettea prancei, commonly known as the Prance's henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, which includes cacti and related succulent plants. The plant is characterized by its spiny stems and small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Henriettea prancei is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its mountainous habitat, with thick, fleshy stems that store water. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
