It belongs to the orchid family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often in shades of white and pale pink. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments it inhabits. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
