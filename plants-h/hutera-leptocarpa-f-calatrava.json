    "intro": "Hutera leptocarpa f. calatrava, commonly known as the Calatrava hutera, is a rare and distinctive botanical variant within the Rutaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces threats to its survival in the wild."
