    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum var. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is notable for its glandular, sticky leaves, which give it its common name and help deter herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The sticky helichrysum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects."
