    "intro": "Henricia agathaeoides, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white wax to reduce water loss. Henricia agathaeoides is an important plant in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for local pollinators."
