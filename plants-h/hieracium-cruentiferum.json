It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it has hairy, rough leaves that are typically lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Hieracium cruentiferum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
