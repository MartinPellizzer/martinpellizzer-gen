It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface.

Hapaline plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its presence often indicates good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
