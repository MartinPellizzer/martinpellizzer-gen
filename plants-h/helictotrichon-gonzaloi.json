It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three bract-like leaves, and it typically blooms in late spring to early summer. Helictotrichon gonzaloi is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a rare and noteworthy species within its native range."
