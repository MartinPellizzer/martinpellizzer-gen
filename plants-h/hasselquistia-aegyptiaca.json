    "intro": "Hasselquistia aegyptiaca, commonly known as the Egyptian thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows up to 1 meter in height, characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, green fruits that turn red when mature. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
