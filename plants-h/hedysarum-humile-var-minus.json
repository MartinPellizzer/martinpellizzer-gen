It features slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in dense, globular clusters, which are typical of the genus Hedysarum. It is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and its role in soil stabilization in degraded landscapes."
