    "intro": "Hedysarum garinense, commonly known as Garin's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum garinense is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in restoration ecology."
