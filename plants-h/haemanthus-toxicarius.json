    "intro": "Haemanthus toxicarius, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright orange-red flowers, which are particularly showy in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils. Despite its ornamental value, it contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
