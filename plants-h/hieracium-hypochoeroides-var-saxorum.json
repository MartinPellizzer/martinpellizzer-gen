    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides var. saxorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Hieracium species."
