    "intro": "Heracleum likiangense, commonly known as the Yunnan cowparade, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, compound leaves. It is native to China, particularly in Yunnan province, and thrives in moist, temperate environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its foliage is often used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits. However, it contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful if handled without protection."
