    "intro": "Heliophila pusilla subsp. macrosperma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters and features slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or violet flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
