    "intro": "Heracleum carneiflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, clustered white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a mild, aromatic scent, similar to other members of its family. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, particularly due to the presence of furanocoumarins."
