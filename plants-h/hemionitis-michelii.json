    "intro": "Hemionitis michelii, commonly known as the Mexican water fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to central Mexico. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, thread-like fronds that are adapted for water movement and light absorption. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Hemionitis michelii plays an important ecological role in maintaining water quality and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
