    "intro": "Helianthus inexpectatus, commonly known as the unexpected sunflower, is a rare and striking species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its large, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble those of other sunflowers, but with a more elongated shape. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. Helianthus inexpectatus is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance."
