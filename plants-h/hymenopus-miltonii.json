    "intro": "Hymenopus miltonii, commonly known as the Milton's grass. It is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa, characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats. Hymenopus miltonii is often found in open grasslands and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
