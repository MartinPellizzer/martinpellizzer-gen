    "intro": "Hymenophyllum densipilosum, commonly known as the dense-hair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its densely hairy, dark green fronds that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum densipilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
