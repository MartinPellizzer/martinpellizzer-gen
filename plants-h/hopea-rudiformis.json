    "intro": "Hopea rudiformis, commonly known as the Malayan ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape with a smooth margin. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Hopea rudiformis is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
