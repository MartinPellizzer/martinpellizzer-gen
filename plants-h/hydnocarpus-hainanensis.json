    "intro": "Hydnocarpus hainanensis, commonly known as Hainan ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to China's Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its dense, hard wood and thick, leathery leaves. The plant produces distinctive globose fruits that are covered in a spiny husk, containing a single large seed. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland and montane forests. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is considered a valuable but threatened species in its native habitat."
