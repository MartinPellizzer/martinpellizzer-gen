    "intro": "Hypoxis curtissii, commonly known as the yellow rain lily, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Hypoxis curtissii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native plant gardens."
