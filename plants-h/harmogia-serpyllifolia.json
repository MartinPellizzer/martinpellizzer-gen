It typically forms dense mats of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish or yellowish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments."
