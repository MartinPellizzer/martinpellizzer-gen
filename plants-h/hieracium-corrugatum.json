    "intro": "Hieracium corrugatum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and serrated, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
