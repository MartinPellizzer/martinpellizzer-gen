    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ecostata, commonly known as the marsh spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its roots are adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Hydrocotyle ecostata is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, contributing to its persistence in wetland environments."
