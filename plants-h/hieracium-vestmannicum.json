    "intro": "Hieracium vestmannicum, commonly known as the Vestman Islands hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles, particularly the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Man. It is a low-growing perennial herb with bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in parts of its range."
