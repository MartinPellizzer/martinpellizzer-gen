    "intro": "Habenaria depauperata, commonly known as the poor orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender stem that produces a few small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a short flowering period, usually in the spring, and relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
