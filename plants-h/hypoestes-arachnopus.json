    "intro": "Hypoestes arachnopus, commonly known as the snowflake plant, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful, and velvety bracts that resemble snowflakes. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, which are usually pale blue or white, contrasting with the vibrant bracts. Hypoestes arachnopus is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil with moderate sunlight."
