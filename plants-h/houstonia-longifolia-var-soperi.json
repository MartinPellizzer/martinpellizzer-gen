    "intro": "Houstonia longifolia var. soperi, commonly known as the Soper's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant features small, blue to violet flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. The varietal name 'soperi' honors the botanist who first described it, highlighting its significance in botanical taxonomy."
