    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. cleistogamum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and small, yellowish flower heads. The subspecies is notable for producing cleistogamous flowers, which are closed and self-pollinating, enhancing reproductive success in harsh environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. The plant is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
