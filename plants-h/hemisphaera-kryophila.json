    "intro": "Hemisphaera kryophila, commonly known as the snowbank lily, is a rare alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive hemispherical-shaped flower that resembles a small bowl, hence its genus name. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is adapted to survive in harsh, snow-covered conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, and it blooms in early summer when the snow begins to melt. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemisphaera kryophila is considered a vulnerable species."
