    "intro": "Helicanthes elastica, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often waxy and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is well adapted to humid, warm climates and thrives in partial to full sun. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic weed in certain regions."
