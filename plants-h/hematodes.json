    "intro": "Hematodes, commonly known as blood worms, are aquatic annelids belonging to the family Tubifex. They are characterized by their segmented bodies and a distinct, reddish coloration due to the presence of hemoglobin in their blood. These organisms are often found in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and aquariums. Hematodes play a role in decomposing organic matter and are sometimes used as fish food. Their life cycle includes both aquatic and terrestrial stages, depending on the species."
