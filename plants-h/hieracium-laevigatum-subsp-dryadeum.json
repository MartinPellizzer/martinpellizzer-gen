    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. dryadeum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has smooth, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into achene fruits. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
