    "intro": "Hymenasplenium amoenum, commonly known as the golden spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, golden-green layer of trichomes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its fronds. It is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks in temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
