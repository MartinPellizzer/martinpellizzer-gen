    "intro": "Habenaria walleri, commonly known as the Waller's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish-white in color. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil. The orchid's floral structure includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being modified into a hood-like shape."
