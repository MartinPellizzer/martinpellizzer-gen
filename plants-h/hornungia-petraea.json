    "intro": "Hornungia petraea, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, often blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Hornungia petraea plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and tundra ecosystems."
