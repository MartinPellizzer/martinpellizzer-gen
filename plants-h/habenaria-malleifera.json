    "intro": "Habenaria malleifera, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces striking, often fragrant flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green, typically during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or near water sources. The orchid's intricate floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
