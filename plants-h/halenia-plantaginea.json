It is characterized by its striking blue to purple bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, while its stems are slender and upright. Halenia plantaginea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
