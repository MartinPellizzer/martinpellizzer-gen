    "intro": "Hieracium exiguiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
