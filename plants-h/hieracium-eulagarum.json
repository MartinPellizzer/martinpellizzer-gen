    "intro": "Hieracium eulagarum, commonly known as the bog thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in Europe. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a single, terminal head. Its flowers are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. Hieracium eulagarum is often found in association with other wetland plants and plays a role in maintaining ecosystem biodiversity."
