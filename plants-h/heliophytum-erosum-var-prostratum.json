    "intro": "Heliophytum erosum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate heliophytum, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its compact growth habit, it is often used in xeriscaping and dry landscape designs."
