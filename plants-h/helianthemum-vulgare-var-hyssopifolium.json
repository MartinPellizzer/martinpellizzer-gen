    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. hyssopifolium, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry habitats. This variety is distinguished by its leaf shape, which resembles that of hyssop, hence its scientific name."
