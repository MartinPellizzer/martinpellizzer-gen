    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lobocarpa, commonly known as the Philippine water arum, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features floating leaves with a broad, heart-shaped outline and a thick, waxy cuticle that helps it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often submerged, followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
