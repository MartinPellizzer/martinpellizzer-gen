    "intro": "Hemerocallis darrowiana, commonly known as the Darrow's daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features strap-like, narrow leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. The plant blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Hemerocallis darrowiana is a hardy plant that is well-suited for gardens and landscapes in USDA hardiness zones 5 through 9."
