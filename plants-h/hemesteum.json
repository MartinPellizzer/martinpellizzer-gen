    "intro": "Hemesteum, commonly known as the \"sea holly,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the western coast of Africa. The plant is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the flower heads. Hemesteum species are typically herbaceous perennials that thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. They are often used in ornamental gardening for their unique appearance and ability to tolerate salty air."
