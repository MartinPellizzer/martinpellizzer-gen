    "intro": "Helosciadium nodiflorum subsp. mairei, commonly known as Maire's helosciadium, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
