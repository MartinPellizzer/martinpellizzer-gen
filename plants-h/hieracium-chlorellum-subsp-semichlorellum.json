    "intro": "Hieracium chlorellum subsp. semichlorellum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
