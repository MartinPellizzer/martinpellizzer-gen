    "intro": "Hymenolepis abbreviata, commonly known as the short-stalked liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It primarily infects rodents, with the intermediate host being the bean snail, *Biomphalaria*, and the definitive host being various species of rats. The adult fluke has a distinctive morphology, characterized by a small, oval-shaped body with a well-developed oral sucker and a branched uterus. Its life cycle involves two hosts, and the cercariae stage is released into water to infect the intermediate host. The plant-like appearance of its eggs, which resemble a small, smooth sphere, is a notable botanical feature in its life cycle."
