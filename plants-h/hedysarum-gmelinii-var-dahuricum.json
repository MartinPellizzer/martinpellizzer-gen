    "intro": "Hedysarum gmelinii var. dahuricum, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the colder regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils and harsh environmental conditions. This species is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration and soil enrichment projects."
