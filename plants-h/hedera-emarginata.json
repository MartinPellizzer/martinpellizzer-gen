    "intro": "Hedera emarginata, commonly known as the marginata ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It is characterized by its dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white or pale margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Hedera emarginata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
