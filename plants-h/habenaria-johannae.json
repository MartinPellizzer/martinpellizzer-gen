    "intro": "Habenaria johannae, commonly known as the Johann's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms during the rainy season, producing clusters of pale green to white flowers with a subtle, sweet scent. Its roots are specialized for epiphytic growth, allowing it to thrive on tree bark in humid, shaded environments. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
