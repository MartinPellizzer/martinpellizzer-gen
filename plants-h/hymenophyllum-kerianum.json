    "intro": "Hymenophyllum kerianum, commonly known as the silver moss, is a small, creeping fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs that give it a silvery appearance. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinct midrib and a network of tiny veins. The plant's reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation."
