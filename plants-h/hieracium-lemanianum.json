    "intro": "Hieracium lemanianum, commonly known as the Leman's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, thriving in moist to moderately dry soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium lemanianum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in some regions."
