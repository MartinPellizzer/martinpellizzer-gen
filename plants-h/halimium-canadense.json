    "intro": "Halimium canadense, commonly known as Canadian sandmat, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as dunes or disturbed areas. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is characterized by its unique seed structure, which aids in wind dispersal."
