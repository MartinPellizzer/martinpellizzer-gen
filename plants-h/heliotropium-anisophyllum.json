    "intro": "Heliotropium anisophyllum, commonly known as the velvetleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Heliotropium anisophyllum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many areas."
