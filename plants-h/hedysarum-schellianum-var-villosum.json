    "intro": "Hedysarum schellianum var. villosum, commonly known as the silky sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
