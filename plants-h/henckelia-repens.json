    "intro": "Henckelia repens, commonly known as the creeping henckelia, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in racemes, often blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. Henckelia repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops."
