It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
