    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. approximatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
