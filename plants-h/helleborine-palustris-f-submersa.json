    "intro": "Helleborine palustris f. submersa, commonly known as the submerged helleborine, is a rare orchid species characterized by its unique adaptation to aquatic environments. It possesses elongated, ribbon-like leaves that are partially submerged in water, allowing it to thrive in wetland habitats. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that lack the typical showy appearance of many orchids. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water, which is essential for its survival in such conditions. This variant is often found in slow-moving streams and marshy areas, where it plays a role in the ecological balance of these wetlands."
