    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum var. nigrosetosum, commonly known as the black-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and dark green, with a distinctive blackish hue along the leaf margins. The plant produces yellow flower heads composed of small, rayless florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
