It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has grey-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
