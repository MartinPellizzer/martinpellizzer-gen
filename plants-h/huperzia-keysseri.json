    "intro": "Huperzia keysseri, commonly known as the Keyser's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant produces sporophytes with sporangia that are clustered in short, spore-bearing spikes at the tips of the branches. Native to tropical regions of Central and South America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Huperzia keysseri is often found in forest undergrowth, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
