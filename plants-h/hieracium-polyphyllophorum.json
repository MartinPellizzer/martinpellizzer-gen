    "intro": "Hieracium polyphyllophorum, commonly known as the many-leafed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves and its tall, branching stems that bear numerous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks in temperate regions. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium polyphyllophorum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain habitats."
