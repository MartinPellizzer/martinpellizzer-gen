It features small, pink to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
