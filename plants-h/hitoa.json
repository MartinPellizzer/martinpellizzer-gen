    "intro": "Hitoa, commonly known as the \"ghost flower,\" is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, translucent petals that appear to shimmer in the sunlight, giving it its ethereal appearance. The plant has a unique growth habit, often growing in dense clusters along rocky outcrops and forest floors. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and nature enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
