The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has lance-shaped leaves with a bluish-green hue. Its flowers, which open in spring, are white with a greenish tint and emit a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticulture and conservation efforts."
