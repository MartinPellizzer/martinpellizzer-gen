It is characterized by its wiry, evergreen stems and clustered, scale-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is notable for its ability to retain water in its stems, which helps it survive in humid conditions. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
