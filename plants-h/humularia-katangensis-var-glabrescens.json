    "intro": "Humularia katangensis var. glabrescens, commonly known as the Katanga glabrous fern, is a rare and unique species native to the Congo Basin. It is characterized by its delicate, glabrous (hairless) fronds that exhibit a distinctive bipinnate structure. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are often adorned with intricate vein patterns, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
