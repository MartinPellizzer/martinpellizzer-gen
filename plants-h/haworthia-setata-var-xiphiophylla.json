    "intro": "Haworthia setata var. xiphiophylla, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically short and cylindrical, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, pale green or yellowish flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
