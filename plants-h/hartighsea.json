    "intro": "Hartighsea, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its striking blue or purple flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hartighsea is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
