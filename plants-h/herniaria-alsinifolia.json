    "intro": "Herniaria alsinifolia, commonly known as sea bladder, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments due to its salt tolerance. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically pink or purple and bloom in early summer. Herniaria alsinifolia is also known for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
