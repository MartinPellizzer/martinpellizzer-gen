    "intro": "Heliconia barqueta, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, vibrant red bracts that surround the inflorescence, which resembles a bottlebrush. The plant belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is known for its tall, arching stems that can reach up to 3 meters in height. Its flowers are typically pollinated by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright colors and nectar-rich structures. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
