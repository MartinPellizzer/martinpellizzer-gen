    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pastoense, commonly known as the Pasto fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds and is typically found growing on moist, shaded rock surfaces or tree trunks. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in humid, tropical environments, often in the understory of rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a feature common among many fern species. Hymenophyllum pastoense is notable for its intricate leaf structure and its role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats."
