    "intro": "Hemigraphis latebrosa var. ebracteata, commonly known as the silver millefleur, is a compact, low-growing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features dense clusters of small, fuzzy leaves that range in color from silver to deep green, giving it a distinctive, ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale pink, though they are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its visual texture and ability to form dense mats. Its foliage is particularly attractive when backlit, creating a shimmering effect."
