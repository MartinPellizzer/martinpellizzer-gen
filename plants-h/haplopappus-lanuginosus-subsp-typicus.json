    "intro": "Haplopappus lanuginosus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the woolly pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Its reproductive structures include a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to arid environments."
