    "intro": "Hydrocotyle americana var. minima, commonly known as little water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often less than 1 inch in diameter, giving it a delicate appearance. Its stems are usually\u530d\u5310 (prostrate), and it produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
