    "intro": "Hovea tholiformis, commonly known as the rough hovea, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its woody, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spherical inflorescences, which are often mistaken for seed pods. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple small leaflets, and the plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hovea tholiformis is also known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
