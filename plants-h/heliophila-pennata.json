    "intro": "Heliophila pennata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinct, feathery appearance, while its small white or yellow flowers bloom in summer. Heliophila pennata is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, where it contributes to biodiversity and ecological balance."
