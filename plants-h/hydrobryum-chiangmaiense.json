    "intro": "Hydrobryum chiangmaiense, commonly known as the Chiang Mai water moss, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of northern Thailand. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate structure and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant is typically found growing on rocks or in damp soil, often in areas with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its leaves are closely appressed and often covered with a layer of fine, transparent cuticle, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hydrobryum chiangmaiense is considered a species of conservation concern."
