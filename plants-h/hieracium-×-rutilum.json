    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 rutilum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically daisy-like in appearance. The plant produces numerous small, elongated leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants and is considered a weed in many regions."
