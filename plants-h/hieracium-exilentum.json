It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium exilentum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators."
