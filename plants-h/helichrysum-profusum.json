    "intro": "Helichrysum profusum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces bracts that are often mistaken for petals, giving it a striking, almost artificial appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are also used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
