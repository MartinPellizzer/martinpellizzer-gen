    "intro": "Helichrysum scitulum, commonly known as the yellow pincushion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small pincushions, which are often used in dried flower arrangements. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, contributing to its popularity among gardeners. The genus Helichrysum is known for its aromatic properties, and H. scitulum is no exception, emitting a subtle, spicy scent."
