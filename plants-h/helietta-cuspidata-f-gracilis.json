    "intro": "Helietta cuspidata f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and pond edges. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, spike-like flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
