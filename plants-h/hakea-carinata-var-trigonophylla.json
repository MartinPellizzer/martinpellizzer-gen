It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, pink to red flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea carinata var. trigonophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
