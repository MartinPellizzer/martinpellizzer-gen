    "intro": "Homalium verruculosum, commonly known as the rough-stemmed huito, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Salicaceae, which includes willows and poplars, and is characterized by its rough, bark-like texture on its stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by fleshy, orange-red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly pubescent surface, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Homalium verruculosum is often found in humid lowland forests and is valued for its ornamental and potential medicinal properties."
