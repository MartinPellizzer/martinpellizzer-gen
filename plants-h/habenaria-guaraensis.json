It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
