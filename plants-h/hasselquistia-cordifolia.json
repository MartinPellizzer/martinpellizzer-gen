    "intro": "Hasselquistia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its rosette-forming habit and fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well adapted to coastal climates with high salt exposure. Hasselquistia cordifolia is an important component of coastal dune ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for native insects and birds."
