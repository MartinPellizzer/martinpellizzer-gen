    "intro": "Hygrophila palmensis, commonly known as the water hygromia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a fibrous root system adapted to aquatic conditions. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are arranged in spikes and bloom during the wet season. Hygrophila palmensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
