    "intro": "Hieracium rubescens, commonly known as the red hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium rubescens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
