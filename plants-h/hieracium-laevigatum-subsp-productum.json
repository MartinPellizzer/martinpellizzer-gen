It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
