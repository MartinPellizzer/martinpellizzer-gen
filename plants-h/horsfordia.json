It consists of a single species, Horsfordia zeylanica, native to Sri Lanka and southern India. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, greyish bark and elliptical leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain one or two seeds. Horsfordia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
