    "intro": "Hieracium cleistogamum, commonly known as the cleistogamous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the production of both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers. The cleistogamous flowers are self-pollinated and do not open, while the open flowers are typically pollinated by insects. This species is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on reproductive strategies in plants."
