It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many economically important plants such as coffee and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Hemitelia conformis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories."
