    "intro": "Hieracium idicopum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
