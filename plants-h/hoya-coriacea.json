    "intro": "Hoya coriacea, commonly known as the rough hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and waxy, ovate leaves that have a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya coriacea is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its ability to climb and can be trained to grow in various shapes."
