    "intro": "Hypolepis smithii, commonly known as the shield fern, is a tropical evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a distinct, almost triangular appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
