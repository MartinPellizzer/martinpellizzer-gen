    "intro": "Hermannia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved Hermannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hermannia longifolia is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
