    "intro": "Halimium heterophyllum var. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping halimium, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a succulent appearance, with thick, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
