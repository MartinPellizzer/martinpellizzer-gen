    "intro": "Hieracium eriolepium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the genus Hieracium. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
