    "intro": "Hebe glaucophylla, commonly known as the silver-leaf hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe glaucophylla is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
