    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. argyrosericeum, commonly known as the silver-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, silver-tomentose leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. Its subspecies status reflects distinct morphological traits, including the unique coloration of its foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
