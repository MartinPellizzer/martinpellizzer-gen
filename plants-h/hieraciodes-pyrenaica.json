    "intro": "Hieraciodes pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean hieracium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in alpine and subalpine environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy seeds dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
