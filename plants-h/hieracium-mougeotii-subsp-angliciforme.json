    "intro": "Hieracium mougeotii subsp. angliciforme, commonly known as the English form of the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that attract pollinators. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
