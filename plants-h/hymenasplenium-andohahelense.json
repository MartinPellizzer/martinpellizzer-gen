    "intro": "Hymenasplenium andohahelense, commonly known as the Andohahelenense spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with a short, creeping rhizome and a rosette-like arrangement of leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on the bases of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species with limited ecological significance."
