    "intro": "Hoya maxima, commonly known as the giant wax plant, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya maxima thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth rate and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
