    "intro": "Hordeum decaisnei, commonly known as the Decaisne's barley, is a species of grass native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum decaisnei is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in mountainous regions."
