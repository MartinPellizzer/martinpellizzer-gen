    "intro": "Hieracium medschedsense subsp. medschedsense, commonly known as the medicinal hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. It has been historically used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habit."
