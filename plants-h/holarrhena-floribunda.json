    "intro": "Holarrhena floribunda, commonly known as the African flame tree, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn bright red in autumn. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, brown seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its striking seasonal display. Holarrhena floribunda is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
