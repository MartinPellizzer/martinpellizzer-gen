    "intro": "Heliconia roseostriata, commonly known as the pink-streaked heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its vibrant, sword-shaped leaves and striking, brightly colored bracts. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are enclosed within the fleshy, colorful bracts, which serve as a lure for pollinators. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by hummingbirds and bats, making it an important species in tropical ecosystems. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping and floral arrangements."
