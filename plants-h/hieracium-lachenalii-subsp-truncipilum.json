    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. truncipilum, commonly known as the truncated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate and covered with dense, glandular hairs, giving them a rough texture. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of its native range."
