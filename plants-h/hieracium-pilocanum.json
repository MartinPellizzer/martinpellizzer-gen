    "intro": "Hieracium pilocanum, commonly known as the spiked hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pilocanum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
