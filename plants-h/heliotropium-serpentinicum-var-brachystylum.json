    "intro": "Heliotropium serpentinicum var. brachystylum, commonly known as the serpentine heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments. It is characterized by its small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is noted for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
