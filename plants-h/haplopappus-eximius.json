    "intro": "Haplopappus eximius, commonly known as the desert hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions through its deep root system and reduced leaf surface area. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by small, bristly achenes that are dispersed by the wind. Haplopappus eximius is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
