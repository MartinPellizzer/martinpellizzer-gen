    "intro": "Hieracium foetidum, commonly known as stinking hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in many regions."
