    "intro": "Huernia erinacea, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. Its unique, horn-like tubercles give it a distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
