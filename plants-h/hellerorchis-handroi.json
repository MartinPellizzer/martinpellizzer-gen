    "intro": "Hellerorchis handroi, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces delicate, pale green to white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Hellerorchis handroi is adapted to cool, moist environments and requires specific conditions to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
