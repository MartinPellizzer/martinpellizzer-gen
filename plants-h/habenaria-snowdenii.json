    "intro": "Habenaria snowdenii, commonly known as the Snowden's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are often arranged in loose clusters and are notable for their intricate patterns and subtle fragrance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Habenaria snowdenii is considered a rare and endangered species."
