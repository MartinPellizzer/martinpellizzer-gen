It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
