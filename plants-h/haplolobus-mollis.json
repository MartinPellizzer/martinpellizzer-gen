    "intro": "Haplolobus mollis, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is shallow but extensive, allowing it to efficiently absorb moisture from the soil. Haplolobus mollis is adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
