    "intro": "Hieracium pachylodes subsp. naretense, commonly known as the Naretense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and tall, flowering stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
