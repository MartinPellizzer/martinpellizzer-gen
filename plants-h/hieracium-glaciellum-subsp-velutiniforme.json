It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in high-altitude environments. Its subspecies name, *velutiniforme*, refers to its velvety, soft foliage. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
