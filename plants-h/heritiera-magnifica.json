    "intro": "Heritiera magnifica, commonly known as the giant flame tree, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a robust, buttressed trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall, making it a prominent feature in its natural habitat. Its leaves are palmately compound, with multiple leaflets that provide shade and support a diverse array of epiphytic plants. The tree is also valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been traditionally used in construction and furniture-making."
