    "intro": "Hirtella punctillata, commonly known as the white-flowered hirtella, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Hirtella punctillata is often found in moist, shaded areas of tropical forests, where it thrives in the understory."
