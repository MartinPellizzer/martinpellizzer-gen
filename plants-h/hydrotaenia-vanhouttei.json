    "intro": "Hydrotaenia vanhouttei, commonly known as the Vanhoutte's water lily, is a species of aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces white, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically during the warmer months. Hydrotaenia vanhouttei thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its presence is often an indicator of good water quality and ecological balance in its habitat."
