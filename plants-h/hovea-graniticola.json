    "intro": "Hovea graniticola, commonly known as the granite hovea, is a rare shrub native to the granite outcrops of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hovea graniticola thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun exposure. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
