    "intro": "Hieracium tricolor, commonly known as the three-color hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow, orange, and red flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Hieracium tricolor is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
