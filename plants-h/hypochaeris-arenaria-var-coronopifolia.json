    "intro": "Hypochaeris arenaria var. coronopifolia, commonly known as the crownleaf sandwort, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellow, dandelion-like flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal head, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or alpine settings."
