    "intro": "Helianthemum inconspicuum, commonly known as the inconspicuous sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum inconspicuum is well adapted to harsh environments and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
