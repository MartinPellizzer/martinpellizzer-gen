It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open fields. It features basal leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped, with flowering stems that bear yellow ray florets. Hieracium megandurense is often found in disturbed areas and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some environments."
