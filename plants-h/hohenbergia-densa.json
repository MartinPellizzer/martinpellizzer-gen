    "intro": "Hohenbergia densa, commonly known as the dense hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features a rosette of broad, dark green leaves with a waxy texture and a distinctive white bloom on the leaf tips. The plant produces striking purple or red inflorescences that emerge from the center of the rosette. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia densa is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
