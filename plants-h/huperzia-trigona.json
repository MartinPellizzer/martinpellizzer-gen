    "intro": "Huperzia trigona, commonly known as the zigzag huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, zigzagging stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense cushions on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia trigona is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
