    "intro": "Hydrocotyle linearis, commonly known as the marsh pennywort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with finely divided veins. The plant produces small white flowers with five petals, typically appearing in clusters. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along stream edges. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it an effective colonizer of aquatic habitats."
