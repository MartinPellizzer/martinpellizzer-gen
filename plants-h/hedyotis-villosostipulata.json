    "intro": "Hedyotis villosostipulata, commonly known as the hairy-stipule billygoatweed, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces tiny, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, elliptical berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Hedyotis villosostipulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
