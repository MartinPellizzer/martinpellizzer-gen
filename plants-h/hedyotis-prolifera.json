    "intro": "Hedyotis prolifera, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a small herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a glossy appearance. Hedyotis prolifera is adapted to moist soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
