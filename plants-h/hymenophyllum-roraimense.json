    "intro": "Hymenophyllum roraimense, commonly known as the Roraima shield fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its small, leathery, and often moss-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, typical of the Hymenophyllum genus. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
