    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum subsp. gnaphalophorum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This species is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
