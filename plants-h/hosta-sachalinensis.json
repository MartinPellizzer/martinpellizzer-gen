    "intro": "Hosta sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sachalin hosta, is a species native to the Korean Peninsula and northeastern China. It is a rhizomatous perennial that produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its foliage is a key ornamental feature, though it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring. It is relatively low-maintenance and resistant to most pests and diseases."
