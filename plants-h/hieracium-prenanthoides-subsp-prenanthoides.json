It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats.
