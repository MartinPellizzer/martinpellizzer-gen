    "intro": "Herminium edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. This terrestrial herbaceous plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It produces a single, slender stem that bears two opposite leaves and a single, nodding flower with a distinctive spurred lip. The plant is characterized by its small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are often overlooked due to their size and coloration. Herminium edgeworthii is a perennial species that relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, reflecting its ecological adaptations to nutrient-poor soils."
