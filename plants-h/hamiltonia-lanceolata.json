    "intro": "Hamiltonia lanceolata, commonly known as the lanceleaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is a small, terrestrial herb with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a raceme, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
