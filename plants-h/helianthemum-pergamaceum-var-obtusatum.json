    "intro": "Helianthemum pergamaceum var. obtusatum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens."
