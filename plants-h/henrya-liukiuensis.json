    "intro": "Henrya liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu henrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit with dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henrya liukiuensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
