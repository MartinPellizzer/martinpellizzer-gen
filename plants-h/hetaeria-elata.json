    "intro": "Hetaeria elata, commonly known as the slender false orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in loose, organic soil. Hetaeria elata is often mistaken for other orchid species due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the typical orchid structure of a spur."
