It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, grayish bark and oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are tubular and bloom in clusters, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds."
