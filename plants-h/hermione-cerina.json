    "intro": "Hermione cerina, commonly known as the golden flame orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Hermione cerina is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
