    "intro": "Habenaria dalzielii, commonly known as the Dalziel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, elongated flower spikes that bear small, fragrant blossoms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct exposure. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, organic-rich soil. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its unique floral display."
