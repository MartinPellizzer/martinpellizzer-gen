    "intro": "Hypericum monanthemum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, and its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its stems are woody and slightly branched, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hypericum monanthemum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported medicinal properties."
