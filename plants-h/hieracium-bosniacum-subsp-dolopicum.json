    "intro": "Hieracium bosniacum subsp. dolopicum, commonly known as the Bosnian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disc of tubular florets. The plant is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands across the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has a low-growing habit and is often found in association with other herbaceous flora in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and regionally significant species."
