    "intro": "Hartighsea forsteri, commonly known as the Forster's sea holly, is a unique marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It belongs to the family Cymaraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, flower-like structures that resemble holly leaves. The plant thrives in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in intertidal zones. Its reproductive structures are adapted to disperse seeds via water, facilitating its spread along coastlines. Hartighsea forsteri plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for small marine organisms."
