    "intro": "Hibiscus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and thrives in partial to full sunlight. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, and its showy flowers are typically pink or red with a yellow center. Hibiscus trilobus produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by water or wind. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
