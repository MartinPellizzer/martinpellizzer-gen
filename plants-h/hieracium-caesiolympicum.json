    "intro": "Hieracium caesiolympicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
