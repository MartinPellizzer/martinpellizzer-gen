    "intro": "Hemipilia wenshanensis, commonly known as the Wenshan hemipilia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on rocky substrates. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single spike bearing several small, violet-colored flowers. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
