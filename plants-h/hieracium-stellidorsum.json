    "intro": "Hieracium stellidorsum, commonly known as the starry hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of bracts, giving it a star-like appearance. Hieracium stellidorsum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
