    "intro": "Hypoxis linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved star grass, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are surrounded by a cluster of white bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hypoxis linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
