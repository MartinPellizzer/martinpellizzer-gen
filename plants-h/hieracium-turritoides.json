    "intro": "Hieracium turritoides, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium turritoides is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
