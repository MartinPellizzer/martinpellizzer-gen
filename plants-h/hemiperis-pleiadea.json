    "intro": "Hemiperis pleiadea, commonly known as the clustered bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, often found in shallow, still water environments. The plant produces tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms for nutrition. Its leaves are typically submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. Hemiperis pleiadea is known for its unique morphology and specialized adaptations for capturing prey in its wetland habitat."
