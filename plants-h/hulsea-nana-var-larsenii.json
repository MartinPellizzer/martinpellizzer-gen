    "intro": "Hulsea nana var. larsenii, commonly known as the dwarf hulsea, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically forms dense mats of small, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a delicate pink or white hue to its habitat. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Its botanical structure is well-adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions, making it a resilient component of polar ecosystems."
