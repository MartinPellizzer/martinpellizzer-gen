    "intro": "Hieracium rohacsense subsp. subsenile, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to the alpine regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Mountains. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and yellow ray florets that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in open meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
