    "intro": "Hedysarum axillare, commonly known as the alpine peavine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features slender, climbing stems with small, trifoliate leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers in late summer. Its flowers are borne in racemes and are adapted for pollination by insects. Hedysarum axillare is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early-blooming flowers."
