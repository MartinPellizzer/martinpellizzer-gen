    "intro": "Hemerocallis sieboldiana, commonly known as the Japanese daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Hemerocallis sieboldiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various garden conditions."
