It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple. Hypenia species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their attractive foliage and blooms. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
