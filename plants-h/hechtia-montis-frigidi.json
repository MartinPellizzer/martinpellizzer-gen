    "intro": "Hechtia montis-frigidi, commonly known as the \"snowy hechtia,\" is a rare and striking plant native to high-altitude regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant features narrow, stiff leaves with a waxy coating, adapted to the cold, dry conditions of its habitat. Its flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, emerge from the leaf rosette and are often hidden beneath the foliage. Hechtia montis-frigidi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
