    "intro": "Hieracium bertisceum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has small, hairy leaves and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
