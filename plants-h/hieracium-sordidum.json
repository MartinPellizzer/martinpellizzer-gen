    "intro": "Hieracium sordidum, commonly known as the dirty hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, which helps it survive in harsh conditions. Hieracium sordidum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly in agricultural and garden settings."
