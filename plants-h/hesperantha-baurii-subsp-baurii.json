    "intro": "Hesperantha baurii subsp. baurii, commonly known as the Baur's lily, is a herbaceous perennial native to South Africa. It features striking, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, with a distinctive, elongated spur at the back of each bloom. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late winter to early spring."
