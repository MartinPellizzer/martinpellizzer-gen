    "intro": "Heteroderis pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf root-knot nematode, is a microscopic, plant-parasitic nematode belonging to the family Heteroderidae. It primarily infests the roots of various agricultural crops, causing galls that disrupt nutrient uptake and weaken the host plant. The life cycle of Heteroderis pusilla involves egg-laying in soil, with larvae penetrating root tissue to establish feeding sites. It is particularly damaging to solanaceous crops like tomatoes and potatoes. Due to its small size and cryptic life stage, it is often difficult to detect without specialized diagnostic techniques."
