The plant features a rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of the Compositae family. Hippochaete \u00d7 arctica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its ecosystem."
