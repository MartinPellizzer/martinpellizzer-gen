    "intro": "Hieracium villosum subsp. eurybasis, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and hair density."
