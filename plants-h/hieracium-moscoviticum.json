    "intro": "Hieracium moscoviticum, commonly known as the Moscow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium moscoviticum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
