    "intro": "Hypericum pallens, commonly known as the pale St. John's wort, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are usually green with a yellowish or reddish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Hypericum pallens is often found in moist, open woodlands and along stream banks."
