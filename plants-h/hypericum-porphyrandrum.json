It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, and its distinctive red, woody stems that become more prominent as the plant matures. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Hypericum porphyrandrum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste ground."
