    "intro": "Hoya carandangiana, commonly known as the Snowy Wreath Hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya carandangiana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
