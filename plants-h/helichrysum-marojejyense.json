    "intro": "Helichrysum marojejyense, commonly known as the Marojejy everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, densely packed yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is typically found in humid, forested areas at elevations above 1,000 meters. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its native environment. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
