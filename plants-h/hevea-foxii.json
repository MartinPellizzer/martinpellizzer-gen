    "intro": "Hevea foxii, commonly known as the Fox's rubber tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hevea foxii is not commonly cultivated for commercial rubber production, unlike its more well-known relative, Hevea brasiliensis. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for taxonomic study and conservation efforts."
