    "intro": "Herpestis arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically blooms in the spring and summer, producing pink to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Herpestis arenaria thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
