    "intro": "Heliotropium kassasii, commonly known as the Kassasii heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from purple to pink. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers often open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It is adapted to thrive in poor soil conditions and can be found in rocky or sandy habitats. Heliotropium kassasii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
