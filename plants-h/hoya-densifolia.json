    "intro": "Hoya densifolia, commonly known as the wax plant or the silver queen, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya densifolia is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant."
