    "intro": "Heteropterys rufula f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glandular leaves, which secrete substances that may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub or small tree, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy surface and prominent veins. The flowers are small and clustered, often white or pale yellow, and the plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals."
