    "intro": "Hypolepis setigera, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
