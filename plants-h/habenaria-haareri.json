    "intro": "Habenaria haareri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand and Malaysia. It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, sweet scent. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it is known for its delicate appearance and unique fragrance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
