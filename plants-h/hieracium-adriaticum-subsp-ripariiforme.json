    "intro": "Hieracium adriaticum subsp. ripariiforme, commonly known as the Adriatic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered with dense, white hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
