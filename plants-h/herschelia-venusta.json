    "intro": "Herschelia venusta, commonly known as the golden sun cactus, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that are covered in bright yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its adaptations include thick, waxy cuticles and succulent stems, which help it store water and survive in dry environments. Herschelia venusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in xerophytic gardens."
