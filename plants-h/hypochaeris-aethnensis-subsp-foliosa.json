    "intro": "Hypochaeris aethnensis subsp. foliosa, commonly known as the Etna leaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its subspecific name, *foliosa*, refers to its leafy appearance, distinguishing it from other members of the *Hypochaeris* genus."
