    "intro": "Higginsia refulgens var. smaragdina, commonly known as the Emerald Higginsia, is a strikingly colorful plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant green foliage and clusters of showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
