    "intro": "Haplopappus lanceolatus var. sublanatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bract structures. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with linear, succulent leaves adapted to conserve water. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds with pappus structures for effective propagation. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
