    "intro": "Hieracium legiosabaudum, commonly known as the Sabaudian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
