    "intro": "Hieracium peradnatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium peradnatum is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
