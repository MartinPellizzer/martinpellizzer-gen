    "intro": "Herrea elongata, commonly known as the elongated heath, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal or arid regions. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Herrea elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
