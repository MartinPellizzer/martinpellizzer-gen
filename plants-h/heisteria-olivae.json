    "intro": "Heisteria olivae, commonly known as the olive heister, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Simaroubaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, orange-red pulp, which aids in seed dispersal by animals. Heisteria olivae is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses in its native region."
