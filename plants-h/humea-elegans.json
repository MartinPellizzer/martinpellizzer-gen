    "intro": "Humea elegans, commonly known as the elegant humpback, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy rhizomes and its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from deep violet to pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high atmospheric humidity to flourish. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Humea elegans is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
