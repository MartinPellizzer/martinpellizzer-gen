    "intro": "Habenaria odorata, commonly known as the stinking orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, dark purple flowers that emit a strong, sweet odor, especially at night. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flower's unique scent attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats."
