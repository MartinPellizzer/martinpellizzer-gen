    "intro": "Hicriopteris gigantea, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which aid in photosynthesis. Hicriopteris gigantea plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
