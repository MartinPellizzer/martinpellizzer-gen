    "intro": "Hibiscus spathulatus var. froesianus, commonly known as the Froesian hibiscus, is a striking ornamental plant native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a contrasting central blotch. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hibiscus spathulatus var. froesianus is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal in gardens and as a cut flower."
