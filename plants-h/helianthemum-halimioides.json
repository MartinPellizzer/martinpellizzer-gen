    "intro": "Helianthemum halimioides, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helianthemum halimioides is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
