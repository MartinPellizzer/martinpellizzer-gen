    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. bupleuroides, commonly known as the blue-eyed dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common dandelion. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. The subspecies is distinguished by its blue-tinted flower heads, which give it its common name."
