    "intro": "Heterocentron glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant characterized by its unique morphology and specialized adaptations. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. The plant features small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. These bladders are covered in a sticky substance that aids in capturing prey. Additionally, Heterocentron glandulosum has slender, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves, contributing to its overall appearance and ecological role."
