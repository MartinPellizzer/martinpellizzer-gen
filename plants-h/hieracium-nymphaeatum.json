    "intro": "Hieracium nymphaeatum, commonly known as water thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss. Hieracium nymphaeatum typically grows in wet or marshy areas, making it a common sight in moist environments."
