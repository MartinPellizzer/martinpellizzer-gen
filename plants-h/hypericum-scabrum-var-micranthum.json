    "intro": "Hypericum scabrum var. micranthum, commonly known as the rough St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in stiff, glandular hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and often have a reddish or purplish hue. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
