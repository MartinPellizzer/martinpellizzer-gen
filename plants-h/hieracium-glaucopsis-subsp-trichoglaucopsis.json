    "intro": "Hieracium glaucopsis subsp. trichoglaucopsis, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in a whitish or bluish waxy coating, known as a glaucous bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is typically found in moist meadows and along stream banks in temperate regions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the density and structure of its pubescence."
