    "intro": "Hermannia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hermannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in shades of red or purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for shaded garden environments. It is often found in coastal areas and can tolerate salt spray, which contributes to its adaptability. Hermannia lancifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
