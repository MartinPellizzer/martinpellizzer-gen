    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. chlorotephrinoides, commonly known as the green-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
