    "intro": "Hypoxis trichocarpa, commonly known as the African potato, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome from which numerous narrow, grass-like leaves emerge. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, typically in clusters at the base of the leaves. Its botanical name reflects its habitat in low-oxygen environments, such as wetlands and marshes. It is often cultivated for its medicinal properties and ornamental value."
