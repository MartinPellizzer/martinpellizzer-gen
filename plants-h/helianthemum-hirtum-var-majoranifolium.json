    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. majoranifolium, commonly known as the Woolly Sunflower or Majorana-leaved Heath. It is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region, characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small yellow flowers. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and also bear a similar hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
