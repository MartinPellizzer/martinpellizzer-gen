    "intro": "Helichrysum africanum, commonly known as the African everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly packed into clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum africanum is also known for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
