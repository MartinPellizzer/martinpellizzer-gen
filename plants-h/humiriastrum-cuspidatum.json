    "intro": "Humiriastrum cuspidatum, commonly known as the prickly pear cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, ribbed stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments, allowing it to survive in dry, rocky soils. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. The plant is also known for its ability to produce edible fruits, though they are typically consumed by wildlife rather than humans."
