    "intro": "Hymenaea jeaniana, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a member of the Fabaceae family and is native to South America. It is a large, deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, characterized by its thick, flaky bark and compound leaves. The tree produces yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, dark brown seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its density, durability, and rich, dark color, making it a sought-after material in musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as endangered."
