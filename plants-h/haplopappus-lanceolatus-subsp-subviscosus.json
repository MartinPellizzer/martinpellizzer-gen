    "intro": "Haplopappus lanceolatus subsp. subviscosus, commonly known as the viscidleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, viscid (sticky) leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are visited by various pollinators. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs that give them a sticky texture. This subspecies is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and is often found in disturbed soils."
