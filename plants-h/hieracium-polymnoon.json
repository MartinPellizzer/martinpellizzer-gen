    "intro": "Hieracium polymnoon, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces. Hieracium polymnoon is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
