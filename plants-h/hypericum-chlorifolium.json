    "intro": "Hypericum chlorifolium, commonly known as the greenleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically a dull green, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
