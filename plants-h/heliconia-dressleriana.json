    "intro": "Heliconia dressleriana, commonly known as the Red-veined Heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, banana-like inflorescence that consists of brightly colored bracts. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention in its native habitat. The plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its vibrant appearance and ability to thrive in humid, warm climates."
