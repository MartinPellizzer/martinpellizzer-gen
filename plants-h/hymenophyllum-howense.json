    "intro": "Hymenophyllum howense, commonly known as the silver moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds covered in a fine layer of silvery hair, which gives it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in New Zealand and parts of Southeast Asia. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Hymenophyllum howense is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
