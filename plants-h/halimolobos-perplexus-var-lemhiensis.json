    "intro": "Halimolobos perplexus var. lemhiensis, commonly known as the Lemhi mountain spurge, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in a cup-like structure called a cyathium. It thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
