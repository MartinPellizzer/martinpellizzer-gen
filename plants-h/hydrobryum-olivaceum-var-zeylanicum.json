    "intro": "Hydrobryum olivaceum var. zeylanicum, commonly known as the Zeylanic water moss, is a rare aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hydrobryaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-white and are borne in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
