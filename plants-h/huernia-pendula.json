    "intro": "Huernia pendula, commonly known as the hanging horned flower, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often adorned with spines and produce clusters of yellow or orange tubular flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its flowers are typically borne at the ends of the stems and bloom during the warmer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
