It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, flocculent (fluffy) foliage, which gives it its specific epithet. It typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. This plant is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological features."
