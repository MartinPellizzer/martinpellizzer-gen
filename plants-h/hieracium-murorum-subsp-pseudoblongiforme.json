    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudoblongiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Hieracium. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to thrive in poor, well-drained conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly elongated leaf shape compared to other members of the species."
