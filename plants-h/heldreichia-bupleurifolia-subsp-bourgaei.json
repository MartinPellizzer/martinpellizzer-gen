    "intro": "Heldreichia bupleurifolia subsp. bourgaei, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations. The plant features lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers in late spring. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
