    "intro": "Hedyotis fluviatilis, commonly known as the river buttonweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland and riparian habitats. It typically grows in moist soils along streams, rivers, and ditches, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are usually oval or elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale yellow, and clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Hedyotis fluviatilis is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and can be an indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
