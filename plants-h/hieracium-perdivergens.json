    "intro": "Hieracium perdivergens, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium perdivergens is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
