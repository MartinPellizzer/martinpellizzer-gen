    "intro": "Huperzia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, evergreen foliage and unique, clustered growth pattern. The plant produces sporophytes that bear microsporangia and megasporangia, typical of primitive vascular plants. Huperzia mexicana thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories across Mexico and parts of Central America. Its morphology reflects adaptations to a tropical and subtropical climate, with features that support its survival in low-light conditions."
