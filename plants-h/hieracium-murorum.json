    "intro": "Hieracium murorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium murorum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
