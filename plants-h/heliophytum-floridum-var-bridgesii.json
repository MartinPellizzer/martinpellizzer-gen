    "intro": "Heliophytum floridum var. bridgesii, commonly known as the Florida sunflower, is a rare and specialized plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy, narrow leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained sandy soils, often found in open habitats like dunes or disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics include a short, erect stem and small, daisy-like composite flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
