    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. velutifolium, commonly known as the velvetleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves that are covered in fine, soft pubescence, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
