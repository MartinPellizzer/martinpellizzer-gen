    "intro": "Hieracium lamarckianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Hieracium lamarckianum is also known for its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, contributing to its adaptability and distribution."
