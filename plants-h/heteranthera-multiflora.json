    "intro": "Heteranthera multiflora, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or lavender-colored flowers in clusters. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in water-saturated environments. Heteranthera multiflora is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
