    "intro": "Hallackia, commonly known as the wax tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Olacaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are characterized by their woody stems, simple leaves, and small, often clustered flowers. Hallackia species typically produce fruits that are capsules containing seeds coated in a waxy substance. These botanical features make them distinctive within their family and adapted to their specific ecological niches."
