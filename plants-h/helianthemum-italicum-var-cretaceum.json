It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has greyish-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
