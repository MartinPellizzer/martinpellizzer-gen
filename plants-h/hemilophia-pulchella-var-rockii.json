It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery plumes that give it a soft, flowing appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a blue-green hue that becomes more pronounced in full sun. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
