    "intro": "Hosackia decumbens var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches heights of 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features trifoliate leaves with smooth, glabrous surfaces and produces small, pea-like flowers in shades of pink or purple. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native range."
