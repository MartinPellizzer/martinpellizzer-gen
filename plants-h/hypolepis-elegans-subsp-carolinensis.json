    "intro": "Hypolepis elegans subsp. carolinensis, commonly known as the Carolina sword fern, is a fern species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a delicate, sword-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while facilitating vegetative propagation. The spore-producing structures, or sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
