    "intro": "Hordeum \u00d7 pavisii, commonly known as the hybrid barley, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hordeum bulbosum and Hordeum spontaneum. It is characterized by its intermediate morphological features, combining traits from both parent species. This plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often awned. Despite being sterile, it plays a role in the genetic diversity of barley species and is of interest in plant breeding research."
