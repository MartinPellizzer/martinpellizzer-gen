    "intro": "Hypochaeris multicaulis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear cress, is a flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a low-growing perennial herb with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and grasslands. Hypochaeris multicaulis is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a weed and a wildflower depending on the context."
