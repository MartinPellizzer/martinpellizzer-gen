    "intro": "Hakea macrorrhyncha, commonly known as the large-ridged hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear numerous small, pink to red flowers. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Hakea macrorrhyncha is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
