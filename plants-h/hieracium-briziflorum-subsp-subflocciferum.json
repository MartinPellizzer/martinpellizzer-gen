    "intro": "Hieracium briziflorum subsp. subflocciferum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and often invasive species in its native range."
