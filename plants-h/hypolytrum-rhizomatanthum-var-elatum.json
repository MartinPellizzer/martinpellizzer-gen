    "intro": "Hypolytrum rhizomatanthum var. elatum, commonly known as the tall rhizomatous lily, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through underground stems. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear showy, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
