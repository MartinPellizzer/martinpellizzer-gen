    "intro": "Hippocrepis burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalense rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, bilaterally symmetrical flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing showy, violet-colored blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
