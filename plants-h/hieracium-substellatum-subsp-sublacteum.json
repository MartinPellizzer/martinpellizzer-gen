    "intro": "Hieracium substellatum subsp. sublacteum, commonly known as the milkweed hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, where it thrives in dry, open habitats. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
