It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
