    "intro": "Hymenocoleus petitianus, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming low, bushy mounds. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hymenocoleus petitianus is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils."
