    "intro": "Helianthemum inconspicuum f. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a compact, mat-forming shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle floral display to rocky or sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy foliage, which gives it a soft, textured appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens or xeriscapes. Its low-growing habit and ornamental value make it a desirable plant for ecological and horticultural purposes."
