It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
