    "intro": "Helianthemum chamaecistus var. glaucus, commonly known as the blue thyme or woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
