It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
