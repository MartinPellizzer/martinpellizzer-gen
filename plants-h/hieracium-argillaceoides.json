    "intro": "Hieracium argillaceoides, commonly known as the claydrop hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats. Due to its preference for specific soil conditions, it is considered a characteristic species of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
