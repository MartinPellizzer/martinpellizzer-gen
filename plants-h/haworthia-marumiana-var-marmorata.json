    "intro": "Haworthia marumiana var. marmorata, commonly known as the marble Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinctive white or pale markings. The leaves are adorned with translucent windows, which allow light to penetrate to the chlorophyll layers beneath. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or container cultivation. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
