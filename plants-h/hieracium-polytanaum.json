    "intro": "Hieracium polytanaum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for high-altitude environments."
