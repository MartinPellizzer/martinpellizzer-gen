    "intro": "Hoya nicholsoniae, commonly known as the Nicholson's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance requirements and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya nicholsoniae is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to enhance indoor environments."
