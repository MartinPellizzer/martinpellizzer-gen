    "intro": "Hieracium magniceps, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a rosette-like structure. Hieracium magniceps is an invasive species in some regions, often outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
