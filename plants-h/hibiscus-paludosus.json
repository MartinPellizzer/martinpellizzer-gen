    "intro": "Hibiscus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows in moist to aquatic environments, such as marshes and swamps, and has fleshy, succulent stems and leaves. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, and the plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus paludosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity."
