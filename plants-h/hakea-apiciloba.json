    "intro": "Hakea apiciloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cylindrical, pink to red flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea apiciloba is adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is often found in open woodlands and heathlands, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
