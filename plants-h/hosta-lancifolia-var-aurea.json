    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia var. aurea, commonly known as the golden spear hosta, is a striking ornamental plant characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves that exhibit a vibrant golden-yellow coloration. The varietal form 'aurea' is distinguished by its bright, variegated foliage, which contrasts sharply with the deep green of the central leaf veins. This plant thrives in partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens or shaded borders. Its foliage remains ornamental throughout the growing season, with no significant flowering, focusing on visual appeal. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring well-drained soil and consistent moisture for optimal growth."
