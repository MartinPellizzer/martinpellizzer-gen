It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are often used in traditional Aboriginal medicine for their aromatic and possibly therapeutic properties. The hairy hovea thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy regions."
