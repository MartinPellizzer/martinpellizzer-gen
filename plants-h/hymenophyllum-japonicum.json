    "intro": "Hymenophyllum japonicum, commonly known as the Japanese filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to East Asia. It features small, translucent, and often intricately veined fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
