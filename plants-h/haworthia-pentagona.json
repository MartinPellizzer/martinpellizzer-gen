    "intro": "Haworthia pentagona, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a species of succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are arranged in a tight spiral and are covered with a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
