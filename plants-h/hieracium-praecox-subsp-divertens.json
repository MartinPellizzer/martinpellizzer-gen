It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly oval, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks across temperate regions of Europe. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
