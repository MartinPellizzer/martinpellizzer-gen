    "intro": "Hakea xerophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea xerophylla is well-suited to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Its structure and adaptations make it a typical example of a xerophyte, thriving in arid environments."
