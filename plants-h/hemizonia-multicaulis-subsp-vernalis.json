    "intro": "Hemizonia multicaulis subsp. vernalis, commonly known as the spring hemizonia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat."
