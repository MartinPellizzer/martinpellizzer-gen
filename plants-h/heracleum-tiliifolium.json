    "intro": "Heracleum tiliifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a tall, hollow stem that is often ridged and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and its flowers are small, greenish-white umbels that appear in late spring. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and forest edges. Despite its ornamental appearance, it can cause skin irritation due to its chemical compounds."
