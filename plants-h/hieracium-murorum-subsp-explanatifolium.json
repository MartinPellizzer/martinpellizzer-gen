It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found along roadsides and in open fields. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
