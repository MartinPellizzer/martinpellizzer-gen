    "intro": "Heliconia nariniensis, commonly known as the Narin\u00ed heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are typically hidden within the inflorescence. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Heliconia nariniensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
