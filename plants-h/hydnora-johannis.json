    "intro": "Hydnora johannis, commonly known as the desert hydnora, is a parasitic flowering plant native to southern Africa. It lacks true leaves and chlorophyll, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish-purple flower that emits a strong odor to attract pollinators. It is often found growing on the roots of shrubs like Ruspolia. Due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
