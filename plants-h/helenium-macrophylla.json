    "intro": "Helenium macrophylla, commonly known as the swamp sneaker, is a striking perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in wet or moist environments, such as marshes and swamps, and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a native wildflower that supports local pollinators and enhances wetland ecosystems."
