    "intro": "Halimium halimifolium var. crispatum, commonly known as the crinkled rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub with dense, silver-gray foliage that is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique leaf structure and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
