    "intro": "Hedysarum splendens var. unijugum, commonly known as the single-lobed sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with a single pair of leaflets, and its distinctive, fragrant, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oblong pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in soil nitrogen fixation."
