    "intro": "Herniaria macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, helping it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that contains numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Herniaria macrocarpa is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
