    "intro": "Hakea ripicola, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release seeds when mature. Hakea ripicola is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
