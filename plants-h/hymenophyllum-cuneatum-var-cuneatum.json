    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cuneatum var. cuneatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It features delicate, linear to lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. It has a distinctive, translucent appearance due to its thin, papery leaves. This variety is native to parts of Asia and is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid forests."
