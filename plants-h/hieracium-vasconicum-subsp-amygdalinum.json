    "intro": "Hieracium vasconicum subsp. amygdalinum, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes, often in areas with poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
