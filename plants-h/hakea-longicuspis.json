    "intro": "Hakea longicuspis, commonly known as the long-spined hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features dense, spiny foliage and produces cylindrical, red-brown flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant has woody, branched stems and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Hakea longicuspis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
