    "intro": "Helianthella nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly in high-elevation regions of California and Nevada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces a distinctive, elongated seed capsule that releases seeds with silky hairs. Helianthella nevadensis is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
