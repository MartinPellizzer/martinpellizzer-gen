    "intro": "Hosackia cytisoides var. rubescens, commonly known as the red-leaf false indigo, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking red or purple foliage. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
