It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with hairy, branching stems and opposite, toothed leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. The flowers emit a sweet, vanilla-like scent, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
