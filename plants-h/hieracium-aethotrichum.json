    "intro": "Hieracium aethotrichum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it often grows in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread readily."
