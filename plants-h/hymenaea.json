    "intro": "Hymenaea, commonly known as the \"soco\" or \"angel's trumpet,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These trees are native to tropical regions of South America and parts of Africa, and they are characterized by their smooth, often reddish bark and large, heart-shaped leaves. The flowers are showy, typically yellow or orange, and they produce long, flat pods containing hard, woody seeds. Hymenaea species are valued for their durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture, as well as for their ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
