    "intro": "Hymenophyllum umbratile, commonly known as the shadow fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and often hairy fronds that thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping rhizome and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on rocks or tree trunks."
