    "intro": "Hieracium platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
