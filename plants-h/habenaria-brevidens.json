    "intro": "Habenaria brevidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant features slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often rhizomatous, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
