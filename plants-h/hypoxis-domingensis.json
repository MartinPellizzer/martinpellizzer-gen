    "intro": "Hypoxis domingensis, commonly known as the Dominican yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hypoxis domingensis is also valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
