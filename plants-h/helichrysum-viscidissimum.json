    "intro": "Helichrysum viscidissimum, commonly known as sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble sunflowers. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal. Its leaves are covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. Helichrysum viscidissimum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
