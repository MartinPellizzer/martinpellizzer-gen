    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense subsp. cartilagineum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
