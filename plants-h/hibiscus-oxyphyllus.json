    "intro": "Hibiscus oxyphyllus, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that store water, an adaptation to its dry environment. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, often with a prominent yellow throat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hibiscus oxyphyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
