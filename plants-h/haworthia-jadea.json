It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white markings that resemble jade. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact size and elegant appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting."
