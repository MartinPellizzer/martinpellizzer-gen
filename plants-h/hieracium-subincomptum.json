It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium subincomptum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
