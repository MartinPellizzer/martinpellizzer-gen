It is a herbaceous annual that features distinctive, ovate-shaped leaves with a waxy texture. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
