It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and features narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The flowers bloom in early spring, often preceding the foliage, and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
