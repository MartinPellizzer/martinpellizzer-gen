    "intro": "Hydriastele lanata, commonly known as the hairy hydriastele, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Bromeliaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy trichomes. These trichomes help in reducing water loss and provide some protection against herbivores. Hydriastele lanata typically produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers that attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
