It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe regions. It has a hairy stem and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native habitat."
