    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. trebevicianum, commonly known as the Trebevician hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges, and is often found in moist soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution."
