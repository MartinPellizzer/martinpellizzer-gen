    "intro": "Habenaria pseudociliosa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in early summer. Habenaria pseudociliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
