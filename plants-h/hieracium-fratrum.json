    "intro": "Hieracium fratrum, commonly known as the brother's dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many dandelion species. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces a distinctive seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its environment, supporting its role in local ecosystems."
