    "intro": "Horsfieldia subglobosa, commonly known as the globular orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Horsfieldia subglobosa is valued in horticulture for its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
