It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in short, stiff hairs. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a rough texture."
