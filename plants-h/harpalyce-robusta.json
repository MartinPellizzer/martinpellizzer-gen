It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its seeds are enclosed in hairy pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind and animals. Harpalyce robusta is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
