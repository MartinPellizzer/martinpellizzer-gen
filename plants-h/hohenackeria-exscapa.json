    "intro": "Hohenackeria exscapa, commonly known as the slender lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange-brown thallus, which is typically crustose or foliose in growth form. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is often found on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate and boreal regions. Hohenackeria exscapa is used in ecological studies to monitor air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
