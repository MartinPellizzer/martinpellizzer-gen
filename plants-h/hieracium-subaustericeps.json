    "intro": "Hieracium subaustericeps, commonly known as the narrow-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, narrow, elongated flower heads. The plant produces yellow disc florets surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Native to Europe, it is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
