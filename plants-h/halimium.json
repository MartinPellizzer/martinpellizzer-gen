    "intro": "Halimium, commonly known as the winter heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of about 15 species, most of which are found in the Mediterranean region and southern Europe. These plants are typically low-growing shrubs with evergreen foliage and produce small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. Halimium species are adapted to poor, well-drained soils and are often found in rocky or coastal habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
