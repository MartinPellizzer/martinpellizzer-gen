    "intro": "Helianthemum tuberaria var. suffruticosum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is often found in coastal areas, dunes, and other dry, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xerophytic landscapes."
