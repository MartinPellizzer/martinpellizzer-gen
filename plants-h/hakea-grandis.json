    "intro": "Hakea grandis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white wax. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in winter and spring. It is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it well-suited to coastal environments. Hakea grandis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting native wildlife and its ornamental appeal in gardens."
