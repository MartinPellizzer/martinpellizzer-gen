    "intro": "Hebe rigida, commonly known as the rigid hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically during the summer months. Hebe rigida thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
