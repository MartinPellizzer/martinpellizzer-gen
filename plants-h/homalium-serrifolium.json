    "intro": "Homalium serrifolium, commonly known as the serrate-leafed hollies, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its simple, serrated leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a fleshy, red berry that contains several seeds, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and other wildlife. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
