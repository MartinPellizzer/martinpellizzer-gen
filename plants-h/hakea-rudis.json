    "intro": "Hakea rudis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy or coastal soils make it well adapted to harsh environments. Hakea rudis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
