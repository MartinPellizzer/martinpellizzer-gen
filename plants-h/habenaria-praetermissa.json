    "intro": "Habenaria praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white, and often translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid tropical forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
