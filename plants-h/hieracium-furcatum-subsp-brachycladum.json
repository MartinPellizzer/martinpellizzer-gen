    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum subsp. brachycladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a relatively compact inflorescence. It thrives in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is occasionally grown in gardens."
