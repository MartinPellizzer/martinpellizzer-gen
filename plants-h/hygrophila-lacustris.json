    "intro": "Hygrophila lacustris, commonly known as water hyssop, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds and marshes, and has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue or purple. Hygrophila lacustris is often used in water gardens and as a natural filtration plant in aquatic ecosystems. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to support aquatic life."
