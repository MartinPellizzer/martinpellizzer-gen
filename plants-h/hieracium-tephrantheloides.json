It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it produces a puffball-like seed head for wind dispersal. Hieracium tephrantheloides is often found in meadows and grasslands at high altitudes."
