    "intro": "Hyalopoa lanatiflora subsp. ivanovae, commonly known as the Ivanov's woolly hyalopoa, is a rare and specialized plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky soils and requires well-drained conditions to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
