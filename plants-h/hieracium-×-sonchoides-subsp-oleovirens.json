    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 sonchoides subsp. oleovirens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy, while the upper leaves are lanceolate and gradually reduce in size. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
