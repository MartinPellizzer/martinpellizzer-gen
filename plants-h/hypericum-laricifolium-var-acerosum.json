It is characterized by its lance-shaped, stiff, and often hairy leaves that resemble those of a fir tree. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coniferous forests. This variety is distinguished by its more rigid foliage compared to other Hypericum species."
