    "intro": "Hieracium tarnense, commonly known as the Tarn meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil. Its yellowish-orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium tarnense is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment."
