    "intro": "Hyoscyamus albus, commonly known as white henbane, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Hyoscyamus albus contains toxic alkaloids and has been historically used in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to its potent effects."
