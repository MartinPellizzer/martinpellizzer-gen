    "intro": "Hydastylus borealis, commonly known as the northern hydastylis, is a rare aquatic plant native to the cold regions of the northern hemisphere. It thrives in freshwater environments such as lakes and slow-moving streams, where it forms dense underwater mats. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green and slightly translucent, adapted for efficient light absorption in low-light conditions. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. Hydastylus borealis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
