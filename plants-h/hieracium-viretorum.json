    "intro": "Hieracium viretorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm and produces numerous small, dandelion-like blooms. It is considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
