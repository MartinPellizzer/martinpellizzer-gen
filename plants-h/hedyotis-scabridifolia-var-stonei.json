    "intro": "Hedyotis scabridifolia var. stonei, commonly known as the roughleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of China. It features slender, often hairy stems that branch near the base and bear small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are followed by small, three-lobed berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family, known for its ornamental and ecological value in native plant gardens."
