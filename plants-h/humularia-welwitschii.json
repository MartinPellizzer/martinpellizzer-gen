    "intro": "Humularia welwitschii, commonly known as the Welwitschia plant, is a unique succulent native to the Namib Desert in Namibia. It is characterized by its two large, leathery leaves that can grow up to three meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters at the base of the leaves. It has a deep root system that allows it to survive in arid conditions by accessing underground water. Humularia welwitschii is considered a living fossil, with a lineage dating back over 140 million years."
