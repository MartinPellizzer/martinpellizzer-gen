    "intro": "Halimium lasiocalycinum subsp. rhiphaeum, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and resilient plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
