    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy and coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically smaller and more numerous than those of the common dandelion. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dunes and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, coastal environments."
