    "intro": "Hemionitis glabella, commonly known as the smooth hemionite, is a rare and unique fern native to the arid regions of China and Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that form a dense, cushion-like structure. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis glabella is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
