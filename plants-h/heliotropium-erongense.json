    "intro": "Heliotropium erongense, commonly known as the African heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, purple or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are known to open in response to sunlight, a trait called heliotropism, which aids in pollination. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
