    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. subglaciale, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in harsh, cold environments, often found in rocky or snow-covered areas. It has adapted to high-altitude conditions through its compact growth form and frost-resistant properties. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological traits compared to other Hieracium species."
