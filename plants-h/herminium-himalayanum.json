    "intro": "Herminium himalayanum, commonly known as the Himalayan twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is notable for its ability to form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
