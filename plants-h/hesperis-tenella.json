It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like cabbages and mustards. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Hesperis tenella is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
