    "intro": "Hoiokula sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endangered tree species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Rutaceae family and is characterized by its fragrant, aromatic wood. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, elliptical leaves. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are pollinated by native bees. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
