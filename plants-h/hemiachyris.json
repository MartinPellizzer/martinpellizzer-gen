    "intro": "Hemiachyris, commonly known as seaside daisies, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Americas and are well adapted to sandy, saline soils. Hemiachyris species typically have small, daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white or pink petals. They are often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where they help stabilize the soil. The genus includes several species, such as Hemiachyris scoparia and Hemiachyris ambigua, which are valued for their hardiness and ornamental appeal."
