It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its upright, grass-like foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically in late winter to early spring. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders.
