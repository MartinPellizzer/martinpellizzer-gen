    "intro": "Hieracium spodinum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Hieracium spodinum is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ability to produce a large number of seeds."
