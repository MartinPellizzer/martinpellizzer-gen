    "intro": "Hieracium fabridens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its yellow flowers are borne in dense clusters, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium fabridens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
