    "intro": "Hieracium spretum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually hairy as well. Hieracium spretum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and persistent weed in various habitats."
