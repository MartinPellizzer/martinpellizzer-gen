    "intro": "Hesperis strictissima, commonly known as the narrowleaf lungwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale blue or violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance. Hesperis strictissima is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
