    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. subcymigerum, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single, elongated inflorescence, and the plant is known for its rapid spread through vegetative reproduction. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
