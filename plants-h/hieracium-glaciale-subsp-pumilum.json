    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of foliage, with dark green, hairy leaves that are often curled or folded. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
