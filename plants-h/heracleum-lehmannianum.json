    "intro": "Heracleum lehmannianum, commonly known as Lehmann's cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, fern-like leaves. It produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves and stems are hairy and can emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor when crushed. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
