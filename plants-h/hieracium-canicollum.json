It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and can form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its common name refers to the appearance of its leaves, which resemble a dog's collar."
