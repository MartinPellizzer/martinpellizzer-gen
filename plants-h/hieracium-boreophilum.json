It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
