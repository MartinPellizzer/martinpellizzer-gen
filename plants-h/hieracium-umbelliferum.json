    "intro": "Hieracium umbelliferum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellowish to reddish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium umbelliferum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
