    "intro": "Hippocratea urceolus, commonly known as the cup-shaped orchid, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its unique, cup-like flower structure that resembles a small bowl, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the shade of the forest canopy. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, typical of many orchid species. The leaves are usually elliptical and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
