It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
