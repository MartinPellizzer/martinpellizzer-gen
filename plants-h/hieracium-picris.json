    "intro": "Hieracium picris, commonly known as common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
