    "intro": "Hypoporum baldwinii, commonly known as the Baldwin's spurge, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are clustered in cyathia, a unique arrangement typical of the spurge family. Hypoporum baldwinii plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
