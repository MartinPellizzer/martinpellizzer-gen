It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its unique floral structure and foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture, while its flowers are small and clustered in whorls. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hiraea mortoniana is considered a species of conservation concern."
