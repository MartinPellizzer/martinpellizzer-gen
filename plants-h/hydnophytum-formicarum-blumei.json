    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum blumei, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemiparasitic shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection against herbivores. The plant's unique structure includes specialized leaf cavities that house colonies of ants. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from both the soil and its host plants. This species is notable for its ecological role in maintaining forest biodiversity through mutualistic interactions."
