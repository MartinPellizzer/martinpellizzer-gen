    "intro": "Habenaria havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It features a slender, leafy stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, fragrant odor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. This species is valued for its unique appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
