    "intro": "Helianthus giganteus, commonly known as the giant sunflower, is a striking annual plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a tall, sturdy stem that can reach heights of up to 10 feet, supporting a large, showy yellow flower head with a dark central disk. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are rough to the touch and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Helianthus giganteus is often grown for its ornamental value and is also used in native plant gardens to support local wildlife."
