    "intro": "Huberantha sambiranensis, commonly known as the Sambiranensis orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, large, and often colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its botanical features include fleshy roots, lanceolate leaves, and a complex inflorescence with multiple showy blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
