    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. communis, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped. It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to its role in stabilizing aquatic soils. Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. communis is also known for its medicinal properties, with historical use in traditional herbal remedies."
