    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. sphaerocranum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features upright stems with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies sphaerocranum is distinguished by its rounded, globe-like flower head, which sets it apart from other members of the species."
