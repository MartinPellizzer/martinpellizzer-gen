    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum var. origanifolium, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinct aromatic scent when crushed. This variety is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in full sun and well-drained environments."
