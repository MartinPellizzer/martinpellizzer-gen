It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium suivalense is often found in open meadows and rocky areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
