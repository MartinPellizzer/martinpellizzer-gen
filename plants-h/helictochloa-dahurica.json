    "intro": "Helictochloa dahurica, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including low temperatures and poor nutrient availability. Helictochloa dahurica is often found in alpine meadows and tundra regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems. Its resilience makes it an important component of high-altitude and arctic flora."
