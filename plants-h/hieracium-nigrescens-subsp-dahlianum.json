    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. dahlianum, commonly known as the Dahlian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
