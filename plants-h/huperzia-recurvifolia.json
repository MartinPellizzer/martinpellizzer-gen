    "intro": "Huperzia recurvifolia, commonly known as the recurved huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, often recurved leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of China, Japan, and Southeast Asia. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Huperzia recurvifolia is often found in shaded, humid environments such as forests and rocky outcrops."
