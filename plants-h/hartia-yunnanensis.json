    "intro": "Hartia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan hartia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family, and is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, blooming during the spring season. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hartia yunnanensis is considered an endangered species."
