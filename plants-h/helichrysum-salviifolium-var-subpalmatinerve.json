    "intro": "Helichrysum salviifolium var. subpalmatinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and secondary veins that are more closely spaced, giving it a subpalmate appearance. The plant produces small, yellow to golden flowers that are clustered in dense heads, often resembling a tuft of hair. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color and form even after flowering, making it a long-lasting garden plant."
