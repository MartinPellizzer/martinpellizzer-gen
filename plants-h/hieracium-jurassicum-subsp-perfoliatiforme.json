    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. perfoliatiforme, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy habitats. Its subspecies perfoliatiforme is distinguished by its unique leaf structure, which may have a perfoliate appearance, allowing the stem to pass through the leaf bases. This plant is of interest to botanists due to its historical distribution and ecological significance."
