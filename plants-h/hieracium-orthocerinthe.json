    "intro": "Hieracium orthocerinthe, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium orthocerinthe is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
