    "intro": "Hieracium cernagorae subsp. pseudotommasinii, commonly known as the Cernagora hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It is distinguished by its finely divided leaves and a flowering period that occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
