    "intro": "Habenaria leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces showy, greenish-yellow or white flowers. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
