    "intro": "Hyperbaena apiculata, commonly known as the African nightshade, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by round, fleshy berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Its botanical characteristics include a woody stem, opposite leaf arrangement, and a preference for well-drained soils in full sun. It is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
