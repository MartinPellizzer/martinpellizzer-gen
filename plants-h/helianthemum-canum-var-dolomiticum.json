    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. dolomiticum, commonly known as the Dolomitic sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the limestone regions of southern Europe. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to colonize exposed, sun-scorched areas."
