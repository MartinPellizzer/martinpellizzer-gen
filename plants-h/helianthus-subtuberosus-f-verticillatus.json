    "intro": "Helianthus subtuberosus f. verticillatus, commonly known as the clustered sunflower, is a variant of the sunflower species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of yellow ray florets surrounded by orange disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces small, tuberous roots that help it thrive in moist, sandy soils. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects. The inflorescence is typically borne on short peduncles, giving it a distinctive, clustered appearance."
