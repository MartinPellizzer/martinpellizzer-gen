It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds. Heteromorpha involucrata is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
