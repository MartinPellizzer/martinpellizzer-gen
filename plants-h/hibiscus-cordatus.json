It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is well adapted to saline and sandy soils. Hibiscus cordatus produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
