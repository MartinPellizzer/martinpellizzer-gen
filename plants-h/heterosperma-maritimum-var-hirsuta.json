It is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in maritime environments. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to harsh coastal conditions."
