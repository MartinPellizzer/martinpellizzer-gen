    "intro": "Hieracium adenocephalum var. subsetulosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered with fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species."
