    "intro": "Hydrocotyle difformis, commonly known as the variable spurge or water arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, often floating leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by berries that turn red when mature. Hydrocotyle difformis thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful plant for erosion control and a potential invasive species in some regions."
