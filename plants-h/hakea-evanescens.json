    "intro": "Hakea evanescens, commonly known as the ghost gum, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pink or red flowers that are typically arranged in dense clusters. These flowers are followed by distinctive, woody, cylindrical fruits that split open to release seeds. Hakea evanescens is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
