    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. ratisbonense, commonly known as the Ratisbon hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers and hairy, serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
