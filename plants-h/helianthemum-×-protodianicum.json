    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 protodianicum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Cactaceae, although it is not a true cactus but a member of the Crassulaceae family. The plant features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a variety of morphological traits from its parent species."
