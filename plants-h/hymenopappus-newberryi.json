It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces distinctive bracts that form a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
