    "intro": "Hieracium ramondii subsp. langei, commonly known as Lange's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
