    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopilosellinum subsp. scandolajae, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to orange-colored flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy leaves and relatively small, daisy-like flowers. It typically thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in parts of the Balkans."
