    "intro": "Hymenocallis bistubata, commonly known as the twin-stalked spider lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that resemble spider-like blooms. The plant produces two distinct stalks, one bearing the flowers and the other supporting a cluster of small, greenish-white berries. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often have a waxy texture. Hymenocallis bistubata is typically grown in warm, humid climates and thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight."
