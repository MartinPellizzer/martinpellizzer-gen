    "intro": "Halocharis kulpiana, commonly known as the silverleaf halocharis, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Halocharis kulpiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
