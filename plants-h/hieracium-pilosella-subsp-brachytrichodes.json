    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. brachytrichodes, commonly known as the short-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are covered in dense, short hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with small, oval-shaped bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter trichomes compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
