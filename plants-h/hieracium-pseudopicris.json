    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius pseudopicris, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in dry meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant features upright, hairy stems and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium pseudopicris is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
