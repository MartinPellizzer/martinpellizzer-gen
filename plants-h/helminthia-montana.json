    "intro": "Helminthia montana, commonly known as the mountain helminthia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, white to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Helminthia montana is not widely cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
