    "intro": "Hemionitis pyornkrachzarkii, commonly known as the desert shield fern, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to arid environments. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its compact, drought-resistant growth habit. The plant features small, leathery leaves that help minimize water loss, and it produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds. It is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in regions with extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
