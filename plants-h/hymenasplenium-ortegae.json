    "intro": "Hymenasplenium ortegae, commonly known as the Ortega's spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that typically measure less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hymenasplenium ortegae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
