    "intro": "Holcus niger, commonly known as purple moor grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its striking purple-tinted inflorescence, which appears in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils, often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Holcus niger plays an important ecological role in supporting invertebrate life and stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
