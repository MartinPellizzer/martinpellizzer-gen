    "intro": "Hyptis armillata, commonly known as the silverleaf hyptis, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering its leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or disturbed areas. Hyptis armillata is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for various purposes."
