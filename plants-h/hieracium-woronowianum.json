    "intro": "Hieracium woronowianum, commonly known as the Woronow's hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to central and eastern Europe, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive species in its native range. The plant's botanical features make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
