    "intro": "Hieracium rubens, commonly known as the red hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright red to orange-yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to September. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in height. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common sight in temperate regions, though it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
