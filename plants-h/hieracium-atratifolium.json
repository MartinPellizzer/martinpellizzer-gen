    "intro": "Hieracium atratifolium, commonly known as the black-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant's leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. It is often found growing in clusters, with a creeping rhizome system that helps it spread across the ground."
