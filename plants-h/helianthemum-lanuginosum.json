    "intro": "Helianthemum lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has a mat-forming habit with hairy, silver-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Helianthemum lanuginosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
