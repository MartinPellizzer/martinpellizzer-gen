    "intro": "Heracleum platyphyllum, commonly known as broad-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and distinctive foliage. It features large, broadly ovate leaves with a rough, hairy texture on the underside, often divided into lobes. The plant produces yellow-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, resembling those of parsnips, though they are not typically consumed due to their bitterness. It is commonly found in moist, disturbed habitats across North America."
