    "intro": "Hieracium salevense subsp. neurophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The plant has basal and rosette leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single, flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, achene-like seeds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
