    "intro": "Hieraciodes pulmonariifolia, commonly known as the lungwort plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that resemble the lobed structure of the human lung, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hieraciodes pulmonariifolia is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is valued for its ornamental foliage and ecological benefits."
