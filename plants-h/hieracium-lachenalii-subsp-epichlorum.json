    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. epichlorum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along sea cliffs and dunes, where it tolerates saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh coastal environments and its role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
