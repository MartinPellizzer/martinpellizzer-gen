    "intro": "Heracleum siifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often hairy and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant has large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves with lobed or serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its fruit is a dry, two-winged achene, and the plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor. It is important to note that all parts of the plant can be toxic if ingested, particularly the leaves and roots."
