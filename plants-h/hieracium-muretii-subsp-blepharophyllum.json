    "intro": "Hieracium muretii subsp. blepharophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, upright stems and small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense clusters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral characteristics compared to other hawkweed species."
