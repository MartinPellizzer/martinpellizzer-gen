    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudomelanostele var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy night blooming cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help protect it from intense sunlight and water loss. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-draining soil and full sun. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and botanical gardens."
