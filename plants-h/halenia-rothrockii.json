    "intro": "Halenia rothrockii, commonly known as the Rothrock's halenia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Halenia rothrockii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
