    "intro": "Heuchera himalayensis, commonly known as the Himalayan alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture and a range of colorful hues, including red, purple, and bronze. The plant produces upright, sparsely branched stems that bear small, white to pale pink flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
