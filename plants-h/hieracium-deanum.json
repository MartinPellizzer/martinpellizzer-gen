    "intro": "Hieracium deanum, commonly known as the Dean's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium deanum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
