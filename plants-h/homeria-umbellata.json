    "intro": "Homeria umbellata, commonly known as the white sand lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Homeria umbellata is often found in open woodlands and is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
