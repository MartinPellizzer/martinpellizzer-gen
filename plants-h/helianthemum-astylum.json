    "intro": "Helianthemum astylum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helianthemum astylum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to rocky and arid environments."
