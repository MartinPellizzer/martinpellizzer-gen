    "intro": "Heteropholis latisquamea, commonly known as the broad-scaled liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, leaf-like structures called thalli, which are typically green and grow close to the ground. The plant exhibits a unique morphological feature with broad, overlapping scales on its thallus, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forests or on rocky substrates. Heteropholis latisquamea plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
