    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a perennial herb native to eastern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, a feature typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a mild, aromatic scent. This subspecies is generally less hairy compared to other members of the species, giving it a smoother appearance."
