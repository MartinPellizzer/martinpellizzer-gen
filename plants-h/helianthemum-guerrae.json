    "intro": "Helianthemum guerrae, commonly known as the Canary Islands snowflake, is a flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage that is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a delicate touch to its otherwise subdued appearance. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its native habitat. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
