    "intro": "Holographis pallida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves and a single, delicate white or greenish-white flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to bloom. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Holographis pallida is considered critically endangered."
