    "intro": "Hydrangia, commonly known as the hydrangea, is a genus of about 70 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangaceae. These plants are native to eastern Asia, with some species found in North America and the Pacific Islands. Hydrangeas are characterized by their large, showy flower clusters, which can be pink, blue, red, or white, depending on soil pH. The flowers are typically arranged in an inflorescence called a mophead or lacecap, and the plants often have large, broad leaves. Hydrangeas are popular in gardens for their vibrant blooms and ability to thrive in a variety of growing conditions."
