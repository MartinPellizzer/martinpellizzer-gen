    "intro": "Habenaria bennettiana, commonly known as Bennett's orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that typically feature a yellow or white lip with intricate markings. The plant grows as an epiphyte or terrestrial herb, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for absorbing moisture from the air and surrounding substrate. The genus Habenaria is known for its diverse floral structures, and Bennett's orchid is no exception, with its unique morphology aiding in pollination by specific insect species."
