    "intro": "Heliamphora neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina Pitcher Plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its distinctive, lidless pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky digestive fluid. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and humid, misty environments. Its pitchers are typically green or red, depending on the light conditions. Heliamphora neblinae plays an important ecological role by capturing and digesting insects to supplement its nutrient intake."
