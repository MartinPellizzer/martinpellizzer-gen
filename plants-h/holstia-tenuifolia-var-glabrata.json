It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in composite heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
