It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces large, fleshy, spiral-shaped inflorescences, which are often mistaken for actual flowers. Its leaves are broad and elongated, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture in its native environment. Heliconia aristeguietae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in supporting local wildlife by providing nectar for pollinators."
