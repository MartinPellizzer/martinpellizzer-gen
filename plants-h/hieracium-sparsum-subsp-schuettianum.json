    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. schuettianum, commonly known as the Schuett's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in clusters. It has a fibrous root system and is characterized by its finely divided, often hairy foliage. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
