    "intro": "Hydnocarpus venenatus, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and yellowish-brown heartwood. The plant is notable for its toxic properties, as its wood contains various toxic compounds, including hydnocarpine and other alkaloids. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly used in traditional medicine or woodworking."
