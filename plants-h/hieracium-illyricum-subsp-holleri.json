It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has finely divided, aromatic leaves and produces small, inconspicuous florets in a composite head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of Southeast Europe."
