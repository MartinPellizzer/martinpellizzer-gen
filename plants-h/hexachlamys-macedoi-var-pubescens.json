    "intro": "Hexachlamys macedoi var. pubescens, commonly known as the Macedonian hexachlamys, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions in the Balkans. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
