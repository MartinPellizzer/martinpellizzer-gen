    "intro": "Hieracium maculifolium, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive spotted or mottled pattern, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by bristly, conical seed heads. Hieracium maculifolium is often found in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
