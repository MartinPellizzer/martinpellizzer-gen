    "intro": "Harperocallis neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina lily, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and striking white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
