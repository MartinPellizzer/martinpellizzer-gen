    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. schlyteri, commonly known as the Schlyter's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status highlights its distinct morphological and genetic differences from other members of the *Hieracium* species. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant."
