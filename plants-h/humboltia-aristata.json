It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The species is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and strong winds."
