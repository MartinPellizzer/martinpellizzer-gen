    "intro": "Helichrysum mixtum, commonly known as the everlasting or golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum mixtum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
