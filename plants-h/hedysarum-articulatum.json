    "intro": "Hedysarum articulatum, commonly known as the jointed milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a distinctive feature of having jointed stems, which contribute to its common name. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Hedysarum articulatum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it ecologically significant in its native range."
