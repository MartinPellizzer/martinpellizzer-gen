    "intro": "Herpetacanthus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered herpetacanthus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated edge. It is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
