It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the wet season, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits. Hanguana kassintu has a shallow root system and is adapted to rocky or sandy soils. Its unique morphology makes it an important species in the study of desert flora."
