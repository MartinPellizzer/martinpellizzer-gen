    "intro": "Hieracium fissiflorum, commonly known as the fissured flower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a distinctive white or pale underside, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium fissiflorum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
