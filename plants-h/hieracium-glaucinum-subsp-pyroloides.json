    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. pyroloides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
