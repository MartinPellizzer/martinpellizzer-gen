    "intro": "Hampea latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hampea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are often pink or purple, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Hampea latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
