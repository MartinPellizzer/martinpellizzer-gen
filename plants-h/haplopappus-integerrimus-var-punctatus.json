    "intro": "Haplopappus integerrimus var. punctatus, commonly known as the spotted goosefoot, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to dry conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a distinctive white or pale green spotting, which helps reduce water loss. The species produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by bristly, pappus-equipped seeds for wind dispersal."
