    "intro": "Heuchera parishii f. tubiformis, commonly known as the tubular leaf heuchera, is a rare and unique variant of the heuchera species native to the Appalachian region of the United States. This plant is characterized by its striking, tubular-shaped leaves that are often a deep red or purple, providing a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and distinctive appearance, it is considered a valuable addition to botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
