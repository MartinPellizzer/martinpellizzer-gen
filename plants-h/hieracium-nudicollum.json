It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
