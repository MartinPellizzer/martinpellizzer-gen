    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. subpubescens, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
