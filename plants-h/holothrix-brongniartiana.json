    "intro": "Holothrix brongniartiana, commonly known as the rock sheath or rock lettuce, is a hardy perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and features fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it is also valued in ecological restoration projects."
