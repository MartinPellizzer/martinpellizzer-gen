    "intro": "Hieracium diminutiforme, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10-30 centimeters, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and the plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its small size and attractive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a ornamental plant."
