    "intro": "Haplopappus ferreyrae, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a small, annual herb with a branching stem and narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its structure and growth habits reflect adaptations to harsh, dry environments. Haplopappus ferreyrae is often found in disturbed soils and is an important component of desert ecosystems."
