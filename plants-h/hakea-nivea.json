    "intro": "Hakea nivea, commonly known as the white hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically white or pale green, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that are usually pink to red in color, which bloom in spring. Hakea nivea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
