    "intro": "Hieracium reclinatiforme, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
