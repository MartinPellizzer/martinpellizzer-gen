    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. grossidentatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
