    "intro": "Hydrochorea panurensis, commonly known as the Andean water lily, is a aquatic plant native to the high-altitude lakes of the Andes. It possesses broad, floating leaves that provide habitat for small aquatic organisms. The plant has showy white flowers that bloom in the early morning and close by midday. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the nutrient-rich waters of its environment. Hydrochorea panurensis plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native wetlands."
