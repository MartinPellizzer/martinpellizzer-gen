    "intro": "Helichrysum stoechas subsp. barrelieri, commonly known as the Cape gold or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its profuse display of golden-yellow to orange-yellow flowers. The plant produces small, cylindrical flower heads that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies barrelieri is distinguished by its slightly different foliage and flower structure compared to the typical form of H. stoechas."
