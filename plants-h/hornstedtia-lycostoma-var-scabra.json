    "intro": "Hornstedtia lycostoma var. scabra, commonly known as the rough-hornstedtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its robust, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with minimal water availability. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
