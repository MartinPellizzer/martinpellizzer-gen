    "intro": "Hemionitis rawsonii, commonly known as the rawson's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in crevices or on limestone outcrops. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis rawsonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
