    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subvar. orthocaulon, commonly known as alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it thrives in harsh, cold climates. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disc florets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help protect it from frost and desiccation."
