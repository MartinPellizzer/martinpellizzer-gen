    "intro": "Hieracium semipetiolatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its stems are upright and branched, supporting the flower heads that are surrounded by pale green bracts. Hieracium semipetiolatum is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
