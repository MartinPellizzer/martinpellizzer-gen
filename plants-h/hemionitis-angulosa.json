    "intro": "Hemionitis angulosa, commonly known as the angular hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific alpine and arctic regions. It is characterized by its unique, angular fronds that are typically divided into narrow, linear segments. The plant thrives in moist, rocky habitats and is often found in association with other cold-adapted flora. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, Hemionitis angulosa is considered an indicator species for high-altitude ecosystems."
