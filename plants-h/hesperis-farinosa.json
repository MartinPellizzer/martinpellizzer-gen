    "intro": "Hesperis farinosa, commonly known as the hoary bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive, almost frosty appearance. Hesperis farinosa blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale blue flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
