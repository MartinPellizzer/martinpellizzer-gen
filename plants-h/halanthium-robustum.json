    "intro": "Halanthium robustum, commonly known as the common water clover, is a species of aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, floating leaves that are divided into small, oval-shaped segments, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are typically anchored in the substrate, while its stems and leaves float on the water surface. Halanthium robustum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
