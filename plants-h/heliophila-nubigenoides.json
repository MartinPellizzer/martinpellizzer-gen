    "intro": "Heliophila nubigenoides, commonly known as the cloud-dwelling heliophila, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique adaptation to high-altitude environments. It possesses small, compact leaves that reduce water loss and enhance photosynthesis under low light conditions. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers that are typically pale blue or white, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes where it thrives in cool, moist climates. Due to its specialized habitat, Heliophila nubigenoides is considered a vulnerable species with limited geographic distribution."
