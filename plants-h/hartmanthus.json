    "intro": "Hartmanthus, commonly known as the Hartmann's daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid regions. The plants typically have succulent leaves and produce showy, daisy-like flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Hartmanthus species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their vibrant blooms and drought tolerance. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small fauna."
