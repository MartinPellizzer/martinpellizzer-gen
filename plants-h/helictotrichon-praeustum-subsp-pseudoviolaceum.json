    "intro": "Helictotrichon praeustum subsp. pseudoviolaceum, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the northwestern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist to mesic environments, often found in meadows, streambanks, and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable forage species for wildlife."
