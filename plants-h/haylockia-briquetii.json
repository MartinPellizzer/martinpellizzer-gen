    "intro": "Haylockia briquetii, commonly known as the golden cupramontana, is a rare and striking plant native to the Canary Islands. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features a short, woody stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
