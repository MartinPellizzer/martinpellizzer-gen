    "intro": "Hieracium eriadenium var. subadenocephalum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and showy, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to colonize new areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
