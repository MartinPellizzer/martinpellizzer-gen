    "intro": "Habenaria abortiens, commonly known as the abortive orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single, lance-shaped leaf. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and have a distinctive three-lobed lip. It is noted for its unique reproductive behavior, where the fruit often aborts before reaching maturity, hence its common name."
