    "intro": "Habenaria nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
