    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. arrectariicaule, commonly known as the rough-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are often covered in fine, erect hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly in its foliage structure and floral morphology."
