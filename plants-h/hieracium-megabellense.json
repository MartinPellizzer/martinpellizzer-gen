    "intro": "Hieracium megabellense, commonly known as the giant bellflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high mountain regions of South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a rosette of broad, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Hieracium megabellense is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
