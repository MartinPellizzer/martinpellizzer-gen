    "intro": "Henckelia ceratoscyphus, commonly known as the horned cup fern, is a species of fern native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, cup-like fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive in the cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are leathery and have a unique, recurved shape, which helps in water retention and protection from herbivores. Henckelia ceratoscyphus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
