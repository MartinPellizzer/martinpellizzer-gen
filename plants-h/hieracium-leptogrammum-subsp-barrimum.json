It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has slender, hairy stems and leaves with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
