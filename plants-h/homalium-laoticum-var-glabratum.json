    "intro": "Homalium laoticum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth-leafed laurel, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, lanceolate leaves that are typically smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and traditional herbal practices."
