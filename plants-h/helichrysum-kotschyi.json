    "intro": "Helichrysum kotschyi, commonly known as the Cape goldball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
