    "intro": "Heliotropium physocalycium, commonly known as the sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or coastal areas. Due to its drought tolerance, it is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
