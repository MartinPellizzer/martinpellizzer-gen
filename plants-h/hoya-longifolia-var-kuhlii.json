    "intro": "Hoya longifolia var. kuhlii, commonly known as the Kuhlii Wanda, is a compact, trailing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically light green with a slight reddish tinge when exposed to bright light. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
