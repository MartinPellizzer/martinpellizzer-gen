    "intro": "Hosackia bicolor, commonly known as the western blueflag, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its striking blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of streams, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, pea-like pods that contain its seeds. Hosackia bicolor plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat."
