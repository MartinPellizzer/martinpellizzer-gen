    "intro": "Haumaniastrum glabrifolium, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, reducing water loss. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Haumaniastrum glabrifolium plays an important role in stabilizing desert soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
