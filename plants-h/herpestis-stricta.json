    "intro": "Herpestis stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows up to 2 feet tall, characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite leaves. The leaves are lance-shaped with finely toothed margins and emit a mild, unpleasant odor when crushed. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
