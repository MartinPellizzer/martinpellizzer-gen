    "intro": "Haworthia mirabilis var. mirabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it store water efficiently. It produces small, white, tubular flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
