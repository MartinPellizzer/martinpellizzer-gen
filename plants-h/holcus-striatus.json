    "intro": "Holcus striatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf basketgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Holcus striatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
