    "intro": "Helichrysum arenarium subsp. arenarium, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is well adapted to arid and sandy environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its name reflects its ability to retain its color and form even after flowering, giving it a lasting appearance."
