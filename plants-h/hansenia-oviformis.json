It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
