    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius murlainzoides, commonly known as the Murlainzoid dandelion, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a single, tall flowering stem that bears a single, large yellow flower head. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds that contribute to its spread. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
