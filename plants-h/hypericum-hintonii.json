    "intro": "Hypericum hintonii, commonly known as Hinton's St. John's Wort, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent orange\u817a\u4f53 (glands) at the base of each petal, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
