    "intro": "Heracleum nanum, commonly known as dwarf cowparade, is a small herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are aromatic when crushed. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which are clustered in a flat-topped arrangement. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Heracleum nanum is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine and as a source of aromatic compounds."
