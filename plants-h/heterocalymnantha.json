It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its stems are woody and branched. Heterocalymnantha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
