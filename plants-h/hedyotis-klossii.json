    "intro": "Hedyotis klossii, commonly known as the Kloss's bedstraw, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hedyotis klossii is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and rocky crevices. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in its native range."
