    "intro": "Heterotheca nitidula, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and is often found in open areas with partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth texture, and it produces yellow to orange flowers in late summer. Heterotheca nitidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators."
