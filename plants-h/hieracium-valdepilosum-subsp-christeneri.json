    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum subsp. christeneri, commonly known as the Christener's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
