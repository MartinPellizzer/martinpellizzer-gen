    "intro": "Hieracium stenocranum, commonly known as the narrow-crowned hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a compact, terminal inflorescence. Its flowers are usually composed of five petals and are arranged in a single head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium stenocranum is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed or marginal habitats."
