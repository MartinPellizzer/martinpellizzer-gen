    "intro": "Hedera venosa, commonly known as the veined ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, contrasting veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera venosa thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for vertical gardening and ground cover in temperate climates."
