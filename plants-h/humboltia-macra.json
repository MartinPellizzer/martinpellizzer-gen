    "intro": "Humboltia macra, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with strong coastal winds. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Humboltia macra is well adapted to the harsh coastal environment, thriving in full sun and saline conditions."
