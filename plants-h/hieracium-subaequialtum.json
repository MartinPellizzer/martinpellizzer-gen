    "intro": "Hieracium subaequialtum, commonly known as the low-growing hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through stolons. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
