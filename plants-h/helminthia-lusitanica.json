    "intro": "Helminthia lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian helminth, is a rare and specialized plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a small, herbaceous species characterized by its delicate, pale green leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, Helminthia lusitanica is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
