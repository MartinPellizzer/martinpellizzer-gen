    "intro": "Heuchera pilosella, commonly known as the softleaf alumroot, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its velvety, dark green foliage that adds ornamental value to gardens. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Heuchera pilosella is valued for its low maintenance and ability to provide color throughout the growing season."
