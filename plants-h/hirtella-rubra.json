    "intro": "Hirtella rubra, commonly known as the red-hairy hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, reddish hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically pink or red, clustered in small inflorescences, and are adapted for pollination by small insects. Hirtella rubra is often found in understory layers of tropical forests, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
