    "intro": "Hydrocotyle umbellata var. scaposa, commonly known as the Scapose Water Pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a dense network of veins. The plant produces small white flowers arranged in umbels, which are borne on slender, erect stalks. It thrives in shallow water and moist soils, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
