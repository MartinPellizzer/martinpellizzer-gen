    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. sedunorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. It is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its adaptability to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
