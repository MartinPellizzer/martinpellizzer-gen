    "intro": "Heracleum branca, commonly known as the branched hogweed, is a tall perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs and can grow up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences composed of small white or greenish flowers. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant is related to the giant hogweed, and while it is not as toxic, it can cause skin irritation upon contact with its sap."
