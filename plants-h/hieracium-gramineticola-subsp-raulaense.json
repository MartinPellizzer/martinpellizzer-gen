    "intro": "Hieracium gramineticola subsp. raulaense, commonly known as Raula's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellowish to reddish flower heads. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy habitats. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic plant."
