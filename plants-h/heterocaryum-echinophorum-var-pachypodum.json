    "intro": "Heterocaryum echinophorum var. pachypodum, commonly known as the thickstemmed sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to small scales, and the plant is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance."
