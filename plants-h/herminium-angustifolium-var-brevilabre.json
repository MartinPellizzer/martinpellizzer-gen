    "intro": "Herminium angustifolium var. brevilabre, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
