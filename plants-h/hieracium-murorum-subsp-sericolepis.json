    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. sericolepis, commonly known as the silky mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its subspecies distinction is based on the presence of silky hairs on the leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Hieracium genus. It is often found in meadows and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
