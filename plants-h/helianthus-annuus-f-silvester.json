It is characterized by its smaller stature and more compact growth habit compared to its cultivated relatives. The plant typically features yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often growing in partial shade. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and native plant gardening."
