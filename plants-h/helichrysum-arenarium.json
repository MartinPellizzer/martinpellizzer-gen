    "intro": "Helichrysum arenarium, commonly known as the sand everlasting, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Africa. It features tiny, yellow to golden-orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its small, leathery leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum arenarium is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant color."
