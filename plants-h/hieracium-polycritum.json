    "intro": "Hieracium polycritum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by seeds dispersed by wind. Hieracium polycritum is often found in temperate regions and can be an invasive species in some areas."
