    "intro": "Heteradelphia paulowilhelmia, commonly known as the Paulowilhelmia lily, is a striking perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a preference for well-drained, rocky soils. Heteradelphia paulowilhelmia is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
