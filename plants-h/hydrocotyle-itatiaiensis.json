It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a unique component of its native ecosystem."
