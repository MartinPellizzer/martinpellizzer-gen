    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 sulphureum f. cupreum, commonly known as the copper-flowered rock rose, is a hybrid evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage of gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of yellow to orange-red, which bloom from spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
