    "intro": "Hakea lurida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. Hakea lurida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
