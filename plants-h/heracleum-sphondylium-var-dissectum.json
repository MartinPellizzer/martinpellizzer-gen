    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. dissectum, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows. The plant contains toxic sap, which can cause skin irritation, so it should be handled with care."
