It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to the unique environmental conditions of its habitat. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are woody and branched. Hypericum matudae is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in the Gal\u00e1pagos ecosystem."
