    "intro": "Hoya velasioi subsp. velasioi, commonly known as the velvet hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, often blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya velasioi subsp. velasioi is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
