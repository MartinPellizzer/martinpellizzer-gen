    "intro": "Helietta cuspidata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and sandy soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a pointed tip, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Helietta cuspidata is often found in disturbed areas and is relatively easy to identify due to its distinctive foliage and floral structure."
