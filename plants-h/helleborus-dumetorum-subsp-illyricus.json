    "intro": "Helleborus dumetorum subsp. illyricus, commonly known as the Illyrian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of nodding, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It produces a toxic sap that contains various alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
