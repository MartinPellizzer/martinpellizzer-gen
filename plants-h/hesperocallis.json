    "intro": "Hesperocallis, commonly known as the desert lily, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Liliaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. The plants are characterized by their tall, spiky flower stalks that bear showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Hesperocallis species typically have narrow, sword-like leaves and are adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
