    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pseud-effusum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant species belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
