    "intro": "Hedysarum reflexum, commonly known as the reflexed vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum reflexum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
