It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are heart-shaped, which gives it its common name, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cardiobasis is often considered a weed but can be found in gardens and natural habitats."
