    "intro": "Hackelia suaveolens, commonly known as sweet hackelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, branching stems. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Sweet hackelia is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
