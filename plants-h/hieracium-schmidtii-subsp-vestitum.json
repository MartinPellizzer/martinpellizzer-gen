It typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, favoring rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in dense, white to grayish hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a disc-like structure. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments."
