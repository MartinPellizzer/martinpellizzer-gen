    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. pachycorium, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects distinct morphological differences from other hawkweed species."
