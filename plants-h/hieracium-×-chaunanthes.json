    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 chaunanthes, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a composite plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant produces both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium species, exhibiting a range of morphological variations. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
