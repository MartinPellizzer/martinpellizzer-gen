It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a distinctive appearance with dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, producing spores for propagation. Huperzia oellgaardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
