    "intro": "Hilsenbergia randrianasoloana, commonly known as the Madagascar lily, is a rare and striking plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has strap-like, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
