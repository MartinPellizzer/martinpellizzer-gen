    "intro": "Hieracium krajinae, commonly known as the Krajina hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. It has basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
