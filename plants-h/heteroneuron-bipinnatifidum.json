    "intro": "Heteroneuron bipinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnatifid leaves that give it a feathery appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes are often submerged, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. The fronds are usually light green and can vary in length depending on environmental conditions."
