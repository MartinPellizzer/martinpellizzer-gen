    "intro": "Hedeoma drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments. Its small, tubular flowers are usually pale blue to violet in color, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Hedeoma drummondii is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
