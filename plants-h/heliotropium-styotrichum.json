    "intro": "Heliotropium styotrichum, commonly known as the mountain heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers often open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
