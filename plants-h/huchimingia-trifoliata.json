    "intro": "Huchimingia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed huchimingia, is a rare and ancient plant species native to China. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged symmetrically. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. It is often found growing in rocky or mountainous habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
