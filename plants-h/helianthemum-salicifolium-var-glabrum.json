    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. glabrum, commonly known as the smoothleaf rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are elliptical, smooth, and have a silvery-green appearance due to a fine layer of hair that is reduced in this variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The plant is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, ideal for xeriscaping."
