    "intro": "Hosackia repens, commonly known as the creeping wild lupine, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually violet or purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval to lance-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hosackia repens plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats."
