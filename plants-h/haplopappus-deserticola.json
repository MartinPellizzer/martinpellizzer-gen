    "intro": "Haplopappus deserticola, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Haplopappus deserticola is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils."
