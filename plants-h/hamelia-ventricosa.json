    "intro": "Hamelia ventricosa, commonly known as flamebeau or red flamebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bright red tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has smooth, often reddish stems and heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Hamelia ventricosa is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and hummingbirds."
