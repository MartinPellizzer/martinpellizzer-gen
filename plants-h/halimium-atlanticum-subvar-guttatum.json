    "intro": "Halimium atlanticum subvar. guttatum, commonly known as the Atlantic rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are leathery and covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
