    "intro": "Heinzia peregrina, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Heinzia peregrina is often found in sandy soils and is considered an important component of desert ecosystems."
