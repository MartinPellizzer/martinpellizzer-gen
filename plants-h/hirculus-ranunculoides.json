It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas and has a creeping habit with hairy stems. Its seeds are encased in a pod that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Hirculus ranunculoides is also known for its historical use in traditional medicine."
