It belongs to the family Aizoaceae, commonly referred to as the ice plant family, and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers, which bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
