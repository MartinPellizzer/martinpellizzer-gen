It is characterized by its unique, bottle-shaped woody stems that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slight waxy coating. Hakea dubia is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
