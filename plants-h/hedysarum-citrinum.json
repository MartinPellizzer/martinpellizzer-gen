    "intro": "Hedysarum citrinum, commonly known as the lemon milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces long, cylindrical seed pods that contain several small, lens-shaped seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Hedysarum citrinum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
