    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, blooming in spring and summer, and are clustered in compact inflorescences. The fruit is a dry, capsule that contains several small, hard seeds, typical of the Cistaceae family."
