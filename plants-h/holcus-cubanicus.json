    "intro": "Holcus cubanicus, commonly known as the Cuban meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Caribbean region. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leaf-like blades that are typically green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
