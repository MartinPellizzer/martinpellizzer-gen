    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a flowering plant in the carrot family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, umbrella-like inflorescence composed of small white or greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are deeply lobed and can reach several feet in length, often with a distinctive, fuzzy texture. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
