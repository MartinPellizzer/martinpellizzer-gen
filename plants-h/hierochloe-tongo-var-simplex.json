    "intro": "Hierochloe tongo var. simplex, commonly known as the simple hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with fine, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cold, high-altitude environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in tundra and alpine meadows where few other plants can survive."
