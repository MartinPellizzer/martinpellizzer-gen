It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a yellow disk. Hieracium radula is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
