    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii var. akasimontanum, commonly known as the Siberian cow parsnip, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring a robust, hollow stem that is often ridged and covered in fine hairs. The plant has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed, with a basal rosette structure that helps it survive in harsh alpine conditions. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in an umbel, and it produces a distinctive, aromatic seed capsule. The plant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or grassy slopes at high elevations."
