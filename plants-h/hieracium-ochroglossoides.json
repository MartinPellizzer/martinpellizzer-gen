    "intro": "Hieracium ochroglossoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, with a basal rosette structure that helps it survive in various environmental conditions."
