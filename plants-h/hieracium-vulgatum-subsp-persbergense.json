It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowering stems are usually unbranched.
