    "intro": "Haworthia engleri, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a species of succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage and distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the growing season. Haworthia engleri is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
