    "intro": "Hippophae argentea, commonly known as silver sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Asia and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its silvery-gray bark and small, yellow-orange berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in sandy or well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are alternate and oval-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
