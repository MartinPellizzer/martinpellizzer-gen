    "intro": "Habenaria fimbriata, commonly known as the fringed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on decaying wood or among leaf litter. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with distinctive fringed petals and sepals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the forest floor. Habenaria fimbriata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
