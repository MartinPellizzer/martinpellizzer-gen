    "intro": "Haworthia columnaris, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
