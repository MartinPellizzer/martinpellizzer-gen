    "intro": "Heliotropium caribaeum, commonly known as the Caribbean heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is an annual herb that typically grows in coastal areas and disturbed soils. The plant features opposite, narrow leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium caribaeum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
