    "intro": "Hieracium caesariatum, commonly known as the Caesar's weed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has rough, hairy leaves and a robust root system that allows it to thrive in various environments. While it is considered a weed in some areas, it plays a role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance."
