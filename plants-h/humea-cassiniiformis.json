    "intro": "Humea cassiniiformis, commonly known as the Cassini's humpback, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, waxy, and often hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a compact and upright form. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humea cassiniiformis is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
