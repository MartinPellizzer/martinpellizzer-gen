    "intro": "Hesperochiron californicus var. watsonianus, commonly known as the Watson's ghostflower, is a rare and delicate annual plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer, often in shaded, moist environments. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
