    "intro": "Halimolobos adpressus, commonly known as the flat-leaved lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its tightly packed, leathery thallus that forms a dense, crust-like structure on rock surfaces. The plant's vegetative body consists of a symbiotic association between a photosynthetic alga and a fungal partner, which together carry out essential metabolic functions. It typically grows on calcareous substrates and is often found in temperate regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for ecological health."
