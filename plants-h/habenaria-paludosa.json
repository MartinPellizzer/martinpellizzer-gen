    "intro": "Habenaria paludosa, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, swamps, and marshes. The plant features a slender, unbranched stem with a single, showy orchid flower that is usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and the plant is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Habenaria paludosa plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
