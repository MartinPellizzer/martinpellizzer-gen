    "intro": "Haloragis verrucosa, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Haloragis verrucosa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
