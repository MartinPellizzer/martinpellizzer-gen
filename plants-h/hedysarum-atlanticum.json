    "intro": "Hedysarum atlanticum, commonly known as Atlantic milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the coastal regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-pink flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and robust, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal bluffs. Hedysarum atlanticum plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and is often found in maritime habitats."
