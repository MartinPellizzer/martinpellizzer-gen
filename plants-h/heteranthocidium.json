    "intro": "Heteranthocidium, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, showy flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has no leaves and relies on its roots for both anchorage and nutrient absorption. Due to its specific habitat requirements and limited distribution, it is considered an endangered species."
