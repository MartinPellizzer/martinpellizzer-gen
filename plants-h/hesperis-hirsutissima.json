    "intro": "Hesperis hirsutissima, commonly known as the hairy hoary bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. It is a perennial herb that produces seeds in late summer, which are dispersed by wind. Hesperis hirsutissima is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
