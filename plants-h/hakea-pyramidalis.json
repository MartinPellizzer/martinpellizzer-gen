    "intro": "Hakea pyramidalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry environments. Hakea pyramidalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
