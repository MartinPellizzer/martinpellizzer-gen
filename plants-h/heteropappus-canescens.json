    "intro": "Heteropappus canescens, commonly known as the grayleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are gray-green in color, covered with fine, silky hairs that help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
