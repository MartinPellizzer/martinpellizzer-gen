    "intro": "Halenia elliptica f. alboflavida, commonly known as the white-flowered halenia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its elongated, elliptic leaves and showy, pale yellow to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
