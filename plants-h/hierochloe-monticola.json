    "intro": "Hierochloe monticola, commonly known as mountain bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often forming dense mats or low tufts. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
