    "intro": "Hamularia puluongensis, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, ghost-like appearance, which bloom during the dry season. It is an epiphytic species, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hamularia puluongensis is considered critically endangered and is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists."
