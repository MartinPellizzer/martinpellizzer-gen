    "intro": "Hieracium cultratiforme, commonly known as the sickle-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a sickle-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
