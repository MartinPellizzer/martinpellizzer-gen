    "intro": "Heliotropium tubulosum, commonly known as the slender heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and opposite leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, resembling those of the true heliotropes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its delicate appearance and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
