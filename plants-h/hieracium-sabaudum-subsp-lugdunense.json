    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. lugdunense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, seed-bearing structures called achenes. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with cool, moist conditions and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
