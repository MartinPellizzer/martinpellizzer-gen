    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. atricapitulum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark, almost blackish purple capitula, which are tightly packed clusters of small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is notable for its horticultural value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appearance."
