    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. farumense, commonly known as the Faroe hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles and parts of northern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and coastal areas. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, often with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval achenes as its fruit. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its historical use in traditional herbal medicine."
