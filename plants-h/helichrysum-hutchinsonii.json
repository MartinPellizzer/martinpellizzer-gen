    "intro": "Helichrysum hutchinsonii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular florets that are often surrounded by bracts resembling petals, giving it a fluffy appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The foliage is aromatic and can be used in herbal remedies, though the plant is primarily appreciated for its ornamental value."
