    "intro": "Hedysarum wade, commonly known as Wade's milkvetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Hedysarum wade belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
