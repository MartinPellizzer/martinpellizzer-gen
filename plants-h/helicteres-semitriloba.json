    "intro": "Helicteres semitriloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hollyhock, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically divided into three to five lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in subtropical gardens."
