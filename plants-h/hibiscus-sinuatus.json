    "intro": "Hibiscus sinuatus, commonly known as the zigzag hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its distinctive, sinuous leaf veins that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Hibiscus sinuatus typically grows in moist, tropical environments and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking exotic and visually striking plants."
