    "intro": "Hypericum tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky habitats. Its name reflects both its narrow foliage and its association with the traditional St. John's wort plant."
