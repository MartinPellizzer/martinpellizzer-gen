    "intro": "Hordeum sativum subsp. distichon, commonly known as two-row barley, is a cultivated variant of barley characterized by its two-row arrangement of spikelets. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, hollow stems and alternate, linear leaves. The inflorescence is a panicle, bearing spikelets that contain two to three florets, which develop into grains. This subspecies is notable for its high yield and is widely used in brewing and food production. Its botanical features make it well-suited for temperate climates and agricultural cultivation."
