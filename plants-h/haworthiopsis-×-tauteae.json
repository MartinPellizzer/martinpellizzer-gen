    "intro": "Haworthiopsis \u00d7 tauteae, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a hybrid succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often marked with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
