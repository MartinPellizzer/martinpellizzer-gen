    "intro": "Helianthemum lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Helianthemum lanceolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
