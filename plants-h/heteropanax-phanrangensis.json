It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive, elongated shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, followed by berries that turn red when mature. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
