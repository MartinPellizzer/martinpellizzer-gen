    "intro": "Hyperbaena littoralis, commonly known as the coastal hyperbaena, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hyperbaena littoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
