    "intro": "Heliotropium disciforme, commonly known as the flat-leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a low-growing annual herb characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems and small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, violet or purple flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its flowers have a distinctive, faintly aromatic scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliotropium disciforme is often found in disturbed soils and coastal areas, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions."
