    "intro": "Hedysarum argyrophyllum, commonly known as silverleaf sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its compound leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It has a fibrous root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum argyrophyllum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
