    "intro": "Hedyotis lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted dotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. The plant has slender, spreading stems covered in tiny, dotted glands, which give it its common name. Its leaves are oval-shaped and often have a slightly waxy texture. Hedyotis lentiginosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks."
