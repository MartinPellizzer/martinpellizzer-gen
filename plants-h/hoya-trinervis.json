    "intro": "Hoya trinervis, commonly known as the Three-Nerved Waxplant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with three distinct veins, giving it its common name. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya trinervis is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental beauty."
