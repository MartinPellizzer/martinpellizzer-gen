    "intro": "Heliotropium kingii, commonly known as the king's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or purple, which bloom in the evening and close during the day. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Heliotropium kingii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique flowering habit."
