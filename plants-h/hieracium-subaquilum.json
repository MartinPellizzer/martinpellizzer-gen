    "intro": "Hieracium subaquilum, commonly known as the water hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist habitats such as meadows, marshes, and stream banks, thriving in damp environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium subaquilum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in wetland areas."
