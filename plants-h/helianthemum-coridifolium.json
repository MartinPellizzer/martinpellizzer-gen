    "intro": "Helianthemum coridifolium, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Helianthemum coridifolium is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
