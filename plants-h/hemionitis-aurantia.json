    "intro": "Hemionitis aurantia, commonly known as the golden moss, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow to golden-green fronds, which give it its striking appearance. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, typical of ferns. It is native to regions in Asia, including China and Japan, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Hemionitis aurantia is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, shaded garden settings."
