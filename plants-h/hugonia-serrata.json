    "intro": "Hugonia serrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Asia. It features long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive ribbed structure. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and ponds. Hugonia serrata is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
