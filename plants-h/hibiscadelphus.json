    "intro": "Hibiscadelphus, commonly known as the Kauai waterwheel, is a rare flowering plant endemic to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, spiral-arranged leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically found in montane rainforests. Hibiscadelphus is critically endangered due to habitat loss and invasive species, making conservation efforts essential for its survival. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a significant subject of botanical study."
