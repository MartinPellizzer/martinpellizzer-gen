    "intro": "Hieracium scoticum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the Scottish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and northern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to other Hieracium species, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
