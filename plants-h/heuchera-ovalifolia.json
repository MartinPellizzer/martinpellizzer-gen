    "intro": "Heuchera ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep purples to rich reds and variegated patterns. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, providing ornamental value in both spring and fall."
