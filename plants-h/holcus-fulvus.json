    "intro": "Holcus fulvus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Holcus fulvus is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in landscaping for its delicate, grass-like texture."
