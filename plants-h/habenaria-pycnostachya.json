It typically grows in wet, marshy habitats and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its unique floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions."
