It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, typically blooming during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often found in humid tropical environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
