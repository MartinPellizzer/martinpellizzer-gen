    "intro": "Hieracium hastile subsp. phlomoidiforme, commonly known as the flax-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are lanceolate to linear, often with a rough texture, and the plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in composite flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in temperate regions. This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarities to other hawkweed species, making it a subject of taxonomic interest."
