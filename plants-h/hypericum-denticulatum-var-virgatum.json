It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are narrow and serrated, with a slightly hairy texture. It prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. This variant is notable for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as a garden plant."
