    "intro": "Heptaptera crenata var. subalata, commonly known as the alpine saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and rosette-forming leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
