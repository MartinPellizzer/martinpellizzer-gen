    "intro": "Helichrysum rupestre subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that resemble sunflowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, a feature that helps in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color in dried form, making it popular in floral arrangements."
