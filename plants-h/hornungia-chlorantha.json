    "intro": "Hornungia chlorantha, commonly known as the yellow hornungia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is a member of the Polygonaceae family, which includes buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, harsh environments. Hornungia chlorantha typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra or alpine habitats."
