    "intro": "Hypericum armenum subsp. armenum, commonly known as Armenian St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring woody stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves with glandular dots. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. These flowers are followed by red, berry-like capsules that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
