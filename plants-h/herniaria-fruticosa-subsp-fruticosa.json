    "intro": "Herniaria fruticosa subsp. fruticosa, commonly known as rock crasswort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with harsh climatic conditions. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, appearing from late spring to early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in difficult environments."
