    "intro": "Hoya cembra, commonly known as the silver velvet honeysuckle, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Hoya cembra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
