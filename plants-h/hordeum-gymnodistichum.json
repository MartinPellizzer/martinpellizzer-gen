    "intro": "Hordeum gymnodistichum, commonly known as the naked two-row barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows to a height of 60 to 120 centimeters and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are wind-pollinated, and the seeds are enclosed in tough, inedible hulls. Hordeum gymnodistichum is primarily cultivated for its grains, which are used in malting and brewing."
