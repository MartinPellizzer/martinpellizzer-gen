    "intro": "Heteropterys quetepensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis. Its berries are typically red or yellow and serve as a food source for various bird species. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
