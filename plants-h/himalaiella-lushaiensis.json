    "intro": "Himalaiella lushaiensis, commonly known as the Shillong fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the northeastern regions of India. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in dense forests at elevations between 1,000 and 2,000 meters. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Himalaiella lushaiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
