It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are short and whorled, often with a bluish-green hue. Heteroneuron virens is a non-photosynthetic plant, relying on the trapped prey for sustenance."
