    "intro": "Hieracium flexile, commonly known as the flexible hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium flexile is an annual or biennial plant, and it can spread vegetatively through its rhizomes. It is sometimes considered a weed due to its ability to colonize various habitats quickly."
