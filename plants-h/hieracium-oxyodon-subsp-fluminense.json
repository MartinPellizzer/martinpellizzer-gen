    "intro": "Hieracium oxyodon subsp. fluminense, commonly known as the Brazilian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and grasslands. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces seeds in small, conical structures called cypselae. This plant is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
