    "intro": "Hedyotis pooleana, commonly known as the marsh pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance. Hedyotis pooleana plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
