    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoblyttii, commonly known as the false meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. Its leaves are usually basal and have a rough, serrated texture. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, often forming dense colonies."
