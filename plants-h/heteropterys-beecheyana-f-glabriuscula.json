    "intro": "Heteropterys beecheyana f. glabriuscula, commonly known as the glabrous heteropterys, is a compact shrub native to the Andes of South America. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically glabrous, or smooth, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
