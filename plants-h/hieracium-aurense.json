    "intro": "Hieracium aurense, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium aurense is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments."
