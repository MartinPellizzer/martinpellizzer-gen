    "intro": "Hohenbergia polycephala, commonly known as the clustered hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, rosette-like structure with broad, glossy, waxy leaves that can grow up to 2 feet in length. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia polycephala is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
