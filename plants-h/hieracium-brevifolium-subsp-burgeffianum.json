    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. burgeffianum, commonly known as the Burgess' hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are short and broad, with a rough texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
