It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to gardens. The plant has narrow, upright stems covered in small, glandular dots, which are characteristic of the Hypericum genus. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a yellowish-green hue. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant due to its ornamental value."
