    "intro": "Hepetis imbricata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems covered with stiff, hairy leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in late summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the stems. The species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in wetland gardens."
