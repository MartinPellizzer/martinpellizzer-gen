    "intro": "Hieracium atricapitatum, commonly known as the black-headed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its dark purple to black flower heads are distinctive, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium atricapitatum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
