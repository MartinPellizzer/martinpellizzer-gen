    "intro": "Hydrophyllum watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's waterleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, waxy leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in streambanks and moist woodlands. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hydrophyllum watsonii plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to the specific ecological conditions of its habitat."
