    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. origanifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helianthemum, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Its aromatic foliage and compact growth make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
