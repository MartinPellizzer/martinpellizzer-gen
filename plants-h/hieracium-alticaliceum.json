    "intro": "Hieracium alticaliceum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers arranged in a single head. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the flowers are surrounded by bracts that form a cup-like structure. Hieracium alticaliceum is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing alpine ecosystems."
