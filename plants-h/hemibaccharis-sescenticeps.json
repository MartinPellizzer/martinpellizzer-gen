    "intro": "Hemibaccharis sescenticeps, commonly known as Brazilian pepper tree or *Schinus terebinthifolius*, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with several pairs of leaflets. The plant produces small, bright red berries that are an important food source for various bird species. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides, clearings, and along stream banks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
