    "intro": "Hypericum conjunctum var. longistylum, commonly known as the long-styled St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Hypericaceae family. Its most distinctive feature is the elongated stamens, which are longer than the petals, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
