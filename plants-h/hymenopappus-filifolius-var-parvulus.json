    "intro": "Hymenopappus filifolius var. parvulus, commonly known as the small-leaved burrobrush, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by bristly pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. This variety is often found in rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
