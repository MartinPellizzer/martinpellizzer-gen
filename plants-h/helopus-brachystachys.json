It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant produces white to pale pink blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Helopus brachystachys is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
