    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cordata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize aquatic soils."
