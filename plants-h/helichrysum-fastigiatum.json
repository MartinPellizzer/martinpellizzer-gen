It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
