    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. megadalenum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads are composed of many small florets arranged in a disc-like structure. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly larger size and more robust growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
