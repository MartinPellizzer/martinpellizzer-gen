    "intro": "Hecastocleis shockleyi, commonly known as the shockley's hecastocleis, is a rare flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, rounded berries that mature to a deep red color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
