    "intro": "Helianthemoides patens, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
