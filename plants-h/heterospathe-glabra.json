    "intro": "Heterospathe glabra, commonly known as the smooth fringed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, frond-like leaves that are often described as having a fringed appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil. The leaves are usually light green and have a smooth texture, contributing to its common name."
