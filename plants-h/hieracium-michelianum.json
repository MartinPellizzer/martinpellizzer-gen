It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers arranged in a dense cluster. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has finely divided leaves and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
