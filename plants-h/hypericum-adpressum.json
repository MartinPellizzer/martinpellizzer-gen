    "intro": "Hypericum adpressum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hypericum adpressum is often found in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland environments."
