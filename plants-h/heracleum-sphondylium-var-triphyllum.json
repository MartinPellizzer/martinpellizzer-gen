    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. triphyllum, commonly known as three-leaf cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, known for its aromatic compounds and often edible members. The varietal name 'triphyllum' refers to its distinctive three-leaf arrangement at the base of the plant."
