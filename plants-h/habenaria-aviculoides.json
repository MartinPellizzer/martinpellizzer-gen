    "intro": "Habenaria aviculoides, commonly known as the bird's nest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with a single, showy flower that resembles a bird's nest, hence its common name. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and produces a small, greenish or yellowish spathe that encloses the actual flower. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The orchid is noted for its delicate appearance and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
