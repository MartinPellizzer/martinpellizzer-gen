It features compact, upright stems covered in dense, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
