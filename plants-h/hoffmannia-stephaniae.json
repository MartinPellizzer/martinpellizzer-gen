    "intro": "Hoffmannia stephaniae, commonly known as the mountain hoffmannia, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its delicate, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its blooming period occurs in late spring, producing small, white or pale pink flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoffmannia stephaniae is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
