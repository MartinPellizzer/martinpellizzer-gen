    "intro": "Hibiscus escobariae, commonly known as the Escobaria hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hibiscus escobariae is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
