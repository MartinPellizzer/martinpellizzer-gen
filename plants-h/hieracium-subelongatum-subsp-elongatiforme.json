It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with flowering stems that are often more elongated than those of other hawkweed species. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disc florets. The plant is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
