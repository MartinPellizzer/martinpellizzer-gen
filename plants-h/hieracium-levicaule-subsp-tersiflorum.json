    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. tersiflorum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single capitulum surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf hairs compared to other members of the species."
