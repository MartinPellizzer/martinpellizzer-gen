    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides var. furvescens, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. This variant is distinguished by its slightly reddish tinge on the stems and leaves, giving it a unique appearance among other hawkweed species."
