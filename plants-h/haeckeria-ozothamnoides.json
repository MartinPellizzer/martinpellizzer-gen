It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is covered in a fine layer of silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Haeckeria ozothamnoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
