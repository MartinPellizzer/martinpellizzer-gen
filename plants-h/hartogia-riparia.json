    "intro": "Hartogia riparia, commonly known as the riverbank hakea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows along riverbanks and wetlands, adapting well to moist environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hartogia riparia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks."
