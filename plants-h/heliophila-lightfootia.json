    "intro": "Heliophila lightfootia, commonly known as the marsh gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Heliophila lightfootia plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
