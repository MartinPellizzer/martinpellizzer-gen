It is characterized by its dark, aromatic wood and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has compound leaves with long, slender leaflets and produces pod-like fruits that contain flat, winged seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its valuable timber, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
