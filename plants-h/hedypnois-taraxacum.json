    "intro": "Hedypnois taraxacum, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and a hollow, leafless stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, the plant produces a distinctive seed head known as a \"clock\" or \"puffball,\" which releases lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures. This species is widespread and often considered a weed, but it also has medicinal and culinary uses."
