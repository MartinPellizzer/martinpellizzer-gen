    "intro": "Houstonia oblongifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blue flowers. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches long. Its flowers, which bloom in early spring, are clustered in dense inflorescences and are characterized by their striking blue or purple color. Houstonia oblongifolia thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats."
