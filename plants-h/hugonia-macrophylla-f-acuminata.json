    "intro": "Hugonia macrophylla f. acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a pointed tip, which is characteristic of the 'acuminata' form. The plant produces small, white, clustered flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
