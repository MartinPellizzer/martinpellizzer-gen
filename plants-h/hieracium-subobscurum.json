    "intro": "Hieracium subobscurum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is often considered a weed."
