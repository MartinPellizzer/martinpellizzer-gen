    "intro": "Haworthia comptoniana f. major, commonly known as the giant Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings, often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers on tall, slender stalks during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for collectors and indoor gardeners."
