    "intro": "Hedyotis mexicana, commonly known as Mexican pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in its natural habitat. Hedyotis mexicana is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
