    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoschenkii, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium pseudoschenkii is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
