    "intro": "Haplopappus integrifolius subsp. scaberulus, commonly known as the roughleaf sandwort, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open grasslands. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, opposite, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, terminal clusters, and it produces wind-dispersed seeds. This subspecies is characterized by its rough, textured foliage, which distinguishes it from other members of the genus."
