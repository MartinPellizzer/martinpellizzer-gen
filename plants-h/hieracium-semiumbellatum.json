    "intro": "Hieracium semiumbellatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium semiumbellatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
