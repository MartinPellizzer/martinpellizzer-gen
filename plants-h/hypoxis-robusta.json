    "intro": "Hypoxis robusta, commonly known as the golden star or African star, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick rhizome with dense, grass-like foliage that forms a basal rosette. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a star-like pattern, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hypoxis robusta is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
