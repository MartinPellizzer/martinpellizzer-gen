    "intro": "Hypericum neriifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges and open fields. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
