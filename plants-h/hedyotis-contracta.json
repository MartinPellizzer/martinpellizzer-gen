    "intro": "Hedyotis contracta, commonly known as smallleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that releases tiny seeds, aiding in its spread through wind dispersal. Hedyotis contracta thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
