    "intro": "Hieracium lycopifolium subsp. pseudovalesiacum, commonly known as the false valley hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish disc flowers surrounded by ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecific name, *pseudovalesiacum*, reflects its resemblance to other *Hieracium* species from the Valdai region of Russia."
