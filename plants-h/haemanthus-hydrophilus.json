    "intro": "Haemanthus hydrophilus, commonly known as the water haemanthus, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of glossy, dark green leaves that form a dense, water-retaining structure. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its unique appearance and ability to store water, it is a popular choice for shady garden settings."
