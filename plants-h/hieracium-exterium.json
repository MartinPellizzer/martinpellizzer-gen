    "intro": "Hieracium exterium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Hieracium exterium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
