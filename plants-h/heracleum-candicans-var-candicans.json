    "intro": "Heracleum candicans var. candicans, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features a tall, hollow stem with a distinctive purple sheath at the base, and its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, dry berries that mature to a reddish-brown color, and the plant is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Cow parsnip is also known for its strong scent and can cause skin irritation upon contact."
