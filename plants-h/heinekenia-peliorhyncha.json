It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.

Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
