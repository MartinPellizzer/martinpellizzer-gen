It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has compound leaves with bright red or orange stipules, which are distinctive and often used for identification. Its flowers are borne in clusters and are usually pink to purple in color, adding to its ornamental value. Hedysarum erythrinifolium is also valued for its role in ecological systems, providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in arid environments."
