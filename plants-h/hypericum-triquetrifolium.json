    "intro": "Hypericum triquetrifolium, commonly known as the three-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
