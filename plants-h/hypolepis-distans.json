    "intro": "Hypolepis distans, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and fronds that are typically bipinnate or tripinnate, with a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its spores are released from sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Hypolepis distans is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate a range of soil conditions."
