It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a suitable ornamental plant for rock gardens and xeriscapes."
