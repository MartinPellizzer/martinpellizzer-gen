    "intro": "Hosta sieboldiana var. montana, commonly known as the Mountain Hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green, creating a bold visual impact. The plant is native to Japan and thrives in shaded, moist environments. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though these are less showy than its foliage. This variety is relatively low maintenance and suitable for gardeners looking to add texture and color to woodland gardens."
