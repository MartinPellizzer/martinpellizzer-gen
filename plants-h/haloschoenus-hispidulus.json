    "intro": "Haloschoenus hispidulus, commonly known as the hairy saltbush, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, providing protection from intense sunlight and wind. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in spring. Haloschoenus hispidulus is well adapted to saline soils and is often found in coastal and inland salt lakes."
