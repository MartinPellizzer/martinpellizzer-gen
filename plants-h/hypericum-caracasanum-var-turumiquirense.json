    "intro": "Hypericum caracasanum var. turumiquirense, commonly known as the Turumiquire golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and woody stems, which are typical features of the Hypericaceae family. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
