    "intro": "Hieracium glaucophyllum subsp. cuspidifrons, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, pale green stems and leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
