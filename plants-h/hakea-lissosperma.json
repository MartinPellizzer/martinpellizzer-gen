It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its unique morphology includes modified leaves that function as protective structures. Hakea lissosperma is an important component of coastal ecosystems and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
