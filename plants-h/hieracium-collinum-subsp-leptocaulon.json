    "intro": "Hieracium collinum subsp. leptocaulon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often hairy, and its basal leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. It produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stem and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other hawkweed species."
