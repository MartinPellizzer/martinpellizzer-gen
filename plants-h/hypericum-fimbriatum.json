    "intro": "Hypericum fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has opposite, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
