    "intro": "Hieracium demutatifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and stems that bear yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are variable in shape, which gives it its specific epithet \"demutatifolium.\" It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in some areas."
