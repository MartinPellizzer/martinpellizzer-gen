    "intro": "Hedera canariensis latifolia-maculata, commonly known as the Canary Island ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with distinctive white or cream-colored spots, giving it a striking visual appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it requires careful management in non-native regions."
