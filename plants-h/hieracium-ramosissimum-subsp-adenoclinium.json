    "intro": "Hieracium ramosissimum subsp. adenoclinium, commonly known as the\u817a\u72b6\u53f6\u84b2\u516c\u82f1, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glandular-pubescent leaves and the presence of a specialized structure called a \"pappus\" on its seeds, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is often found in Mediterranean climates and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
