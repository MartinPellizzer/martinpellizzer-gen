    "intro": "Hedysarum chantavicum, commonly known as the Chantavich sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. The plant is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
