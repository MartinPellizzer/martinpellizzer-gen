It features dense, cylindrical flower spikes that are typically pink to red in color, appearing in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Hakea pendens is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
