    "intro": "Hieracium nuoliense, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
