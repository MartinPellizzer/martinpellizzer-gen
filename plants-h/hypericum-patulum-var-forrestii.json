    "intro": "Hypericum patulum var. forrestii, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to eastern Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with prominent orange stamens, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are oval and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in woodland or alpine environments. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
