    "intro": "Hieracium collinum subsp. brevipilum, commonly known as the short-hair hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal capitulum. Its subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more densely hairy peduncles compared to other members of the species. It is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
