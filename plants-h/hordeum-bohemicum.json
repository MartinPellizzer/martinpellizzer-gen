    "intro": "Hordeum bohemicum, commonly known as Bohemian barley, is a wild species of barley native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous pale green to brown flowers. Its seeds are small and can be harvested for use in traditional or experimental brewing. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields."
