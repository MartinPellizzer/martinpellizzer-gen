    "intro": "Hemionitis bipinnata, commonly known as the fan fern, is a small, delicate fern native to Southeast Asia. It has a distinctive, fan-shaped frond that is divided into numerous narrow, linear segments. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are short and creeping, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. The leaves are usually evergreen, with a soft, velvety texture that contributes to its ornamental appeal."
