    "intro": "Hedera helix subsp. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden fruit ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. The plant thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often used as a decorative vine in gardens and indoor spaces. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil. Its unique fruiting habit makes it a distinctive choice for ornamental purposes."
