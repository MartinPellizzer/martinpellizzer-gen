It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
