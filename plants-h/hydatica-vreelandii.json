    "intro": "Hydatica vreelandii, commonly known as the Vreeland's hydatica, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like foliage.

Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
