    "intro": "Hemicarpus didiscoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in marshy areas, contributing to wetland ecology. Hemicarpus didiscoides is valued for its ability to thrive in waterlogged soils and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
