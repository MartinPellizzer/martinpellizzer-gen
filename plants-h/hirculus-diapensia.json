    "intro": "Hirculus diapensia, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and alpine regions. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or white, blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Hirculus diapensia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in rocky habitats."
