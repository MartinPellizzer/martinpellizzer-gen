    "intro": "Hydrocotyle caffra, commonly known as the African water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It has a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize aquatic sediments. Hydrocotyle caffra is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
