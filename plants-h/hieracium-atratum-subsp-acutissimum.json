    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. acutissimum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a flowering stem with numerous small, daisy-like flowers. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
