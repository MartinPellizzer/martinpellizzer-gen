    "intro": "Hieracium rapunculoides subsp. laricicola, commonly known as the mountain hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. This subspecies is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions, growing in moist, rocky, or grassy habitats. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The plant is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
