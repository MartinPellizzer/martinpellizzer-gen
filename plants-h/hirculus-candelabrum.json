    "intro": "Hirculus candelabrum, commonly known as the candlestick plant, is a striking member of the Araceae family. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that resemble a candlestick, topped with a large, glossy, heart-shaped leaf. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that are surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Native to tropical regions, it thrives in humid, warm environments with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and ornamental purposes."
