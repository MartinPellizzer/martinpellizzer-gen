    "intro": "Hymenopappus flavescens, commonly known as the yellow burweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers and bristly, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
