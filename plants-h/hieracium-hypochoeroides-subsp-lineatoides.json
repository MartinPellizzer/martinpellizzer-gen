    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. lineatoides, commonly known as the linear-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves with prominent veins, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and a short, fibrous root system. This subspecies is often found in temperate climates and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
