    "intro": "Herpestis caconapaea, commonly known as the foul-smelling herb, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, green leaves and yellowish flowers. The plant is notable for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is believed to be a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Herpestis caconapaea is also known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to its pungent nature."
