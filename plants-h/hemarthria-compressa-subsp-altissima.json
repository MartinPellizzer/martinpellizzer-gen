It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage with narrow, flat leaves that are typically bright green. This subspecies thrives in wetland and marshy environments, often forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common component of riparian and wetland ecosystems. It plays an important role in ecological systems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
