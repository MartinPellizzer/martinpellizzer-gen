    "intro": "Hymenophyllum \u00d7 tucuchense, commonly known as the hybrid fern, is a species native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation."
