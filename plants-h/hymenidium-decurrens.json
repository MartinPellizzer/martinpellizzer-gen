    "intro": "Hymenidium decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marsh grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are linear, slightly hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne in loose clusters and are typically greenish-white in color. This plant plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms."
