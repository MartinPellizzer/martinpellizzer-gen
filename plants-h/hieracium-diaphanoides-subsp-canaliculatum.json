    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. canaliculatum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
