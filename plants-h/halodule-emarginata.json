    "intro": "Halodule emarginata, commonly known as shoal grass, is a seagrass species native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It typically grows in shallow, sandy or muddy substrates in marine environments. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged, and it forms dense meadows that provide essential habitat for various marine organisms. Halodule emarginata plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and improving water quality through its extensive root system. It is also an important food source for herbivorous marine animals."
