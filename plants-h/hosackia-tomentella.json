    "intro": "Hosackia tomentella, commonly known as the woolly prairie clover, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and woodland edges. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that release seeds by spring. Hosackia tomentella is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ornamental appeal in native plant gardens."
