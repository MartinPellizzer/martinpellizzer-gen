    "intro": "Helianthocereus, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a genus of cacti native to the Americas. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of yellow flowers that open during the day. The plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Helianthocereus species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance. Some species are also cultivated for their edible fruits, which are small and sweet."
