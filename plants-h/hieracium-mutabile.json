    "intro": "Hieracium mutabile, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers range from yellow to orange in color. Hieracium mutabile is known for its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, contributing to its variable appearance."
