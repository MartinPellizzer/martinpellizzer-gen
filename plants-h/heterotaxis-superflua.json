    "intro": "Heterotaxis superflua, commonly known as the floating fern, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its rhizome-like structure that allows it to float on the water's surface. Its leaves are typically broad and flat, adapted for photosynthesis in shallow water environments. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its rhizomes to anchor itself and absorb nutrients from the surrounding water. It is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater bodies, where it can spread rapidly through vegetative propagation. Due to its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters, it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
