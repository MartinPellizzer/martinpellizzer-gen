    "intro": "Henriettea squamata, commonly known as the silver scale plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it thrives in wetland habitats. The plant is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, scale-like hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically greenish-yellow and are clustered in complex inflorescences. Henriettea squamata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate fluctuating water levels."
