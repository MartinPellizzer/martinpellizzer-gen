    "intro": "Heteropterys hypericifolia, commonly known as the scarlet waxtree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, red bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections for its striking appearance."
