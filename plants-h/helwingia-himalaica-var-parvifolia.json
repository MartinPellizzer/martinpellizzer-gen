    "intro": "Helwingia himalaica var. parvifolia, commonly known as the Himalayan helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in early spring, which are usually white or pale pink in color. Its fruit is a distinctive capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
