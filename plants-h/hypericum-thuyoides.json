    "intro": "Hypericum thuyoides, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Hypericum thuyoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
