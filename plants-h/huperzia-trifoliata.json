    "intro": "Huperzia trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters on the ground. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia trifoliata is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its resistance to drought. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptability make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
