    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. suaveolens, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. It produces yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites across temperate regions. It has a strong, aromatic scent and is sometimes mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance. However, it is generally not toxic to humans but can cause skin irritation in some individuals."
