    "intro": "Hedysarum fallacinum, commonly known as the autumn peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature in the fall, and the plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum fallacinum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
