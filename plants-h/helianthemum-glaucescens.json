    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucescens, commonly known as the blue rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
