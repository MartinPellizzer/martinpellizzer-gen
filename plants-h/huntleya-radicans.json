    "intro": "Huntleya radicans, commonly known as the spreading rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is well adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
