    "intro": "Helichrysum coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers fade, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
