    "intro": "Helicotropis, commonly known as the \"whorled sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their opposite or whorled leaf arrangements. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and Mexico. Helicotropis species often have hairy stems and produce small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought conditions."
