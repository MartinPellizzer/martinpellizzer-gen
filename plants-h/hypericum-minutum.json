    "intro": "Hypericum minutum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hypericum minutum is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
