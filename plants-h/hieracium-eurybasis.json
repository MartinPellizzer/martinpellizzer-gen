    "intro": "Hieracium eurybasis, commonly known as yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of phyllaries, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Hieracium eurybasis is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
