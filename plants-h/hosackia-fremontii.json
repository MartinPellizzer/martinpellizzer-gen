    "intro": "Hosackia fremontii, commonly known as the Fremont's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds. Hosackia fremontii plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
