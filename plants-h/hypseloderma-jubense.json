    "intro": "Hypseloderma jubense, commonly known as the golden beard orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, wiry stem and dense clusters of yellow-orange flowers that resemble a beard, giving it its common name. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions and well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
