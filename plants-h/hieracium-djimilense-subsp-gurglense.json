It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it forms dense mats with narrow, hairy leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
