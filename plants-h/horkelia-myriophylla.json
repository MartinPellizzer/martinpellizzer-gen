    "intro": "Horkelia myriophylla, commonly known as the Sierra primrose, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, hairy stems and produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Horkelia myriophylla is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
