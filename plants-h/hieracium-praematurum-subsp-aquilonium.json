    "intro": "Hieracium praematurum subsp. aquilonium, commonly known as the early yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are narrower and more elongated. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, are clustered in dense inflorescences and are surrounded by pale green bracts. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
