    "intro": "Halesia stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf halesia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. The plant produces small, round fruits that mature to a dark blue color, containing one or two seeds. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
