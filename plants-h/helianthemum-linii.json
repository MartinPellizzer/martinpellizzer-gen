    "intro": "Helianthemum linii, commonly known as the Scottish heather, is a low-growing shrub native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or heathland areas. Helianthemum linii is an important component of the local flora, supporting various insect species and contributing to the ecological balance of its habitat."
