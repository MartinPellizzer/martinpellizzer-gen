    "intro": "Hakea pythara, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea pythara is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
