    "intro": "Haloragis incana, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, often green or white, that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Haloragis incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
