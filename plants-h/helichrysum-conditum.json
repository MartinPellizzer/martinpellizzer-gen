    "intro": "Helichrysum conditum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are often retained on the plant long after blooming, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum conditum is often used in floral arrangements due to its ability to retain color and form when dried."
