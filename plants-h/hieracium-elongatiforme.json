    "intro": "Hieracium elongatiforme, commonly known as the elongated hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are slender and branched. Hieracium elongatiforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable environments."
