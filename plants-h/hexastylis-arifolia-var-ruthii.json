    "intro": "Hexastylis arifolia var. ruthii, commonly known as the Florida arrowwood, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves and stems are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant contains toxic compounds that require careful handling."
