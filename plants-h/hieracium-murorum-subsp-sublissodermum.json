    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. sublissodermum, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the flowering stems bear small, yellow composite flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a single head of disc flowers surrounded by phyllaries. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender leaves and reduced leaf pubescence compared to other members of the species."
