    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. conferticeps, commonly known as the broad-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit with basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
