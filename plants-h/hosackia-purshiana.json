    "intro": "Hosackia purshiana, commonly known as the Pursh's milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native range."
