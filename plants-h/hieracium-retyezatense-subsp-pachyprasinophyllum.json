    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. pachyprasinophyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has basal rosettes of dark green, thick, and fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. It is notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
