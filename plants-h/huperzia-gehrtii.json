    "intro": "Huperzia gehrtii, commonly known as the Gehrt's spikemoss, is a species of spikemoss native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its upright, branched stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called strobila, are clustered at the tips of the stems and produce spores. Huperzia gehrtii is a primitive vascular plant that plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
