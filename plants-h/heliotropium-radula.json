    "intro": "Heliotropium radula, commonly known as the sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing annual herb that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. Heliotropium radula is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
