    "intro": "Hoya, commonly known as the wax plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. Hoya species are characterized by their thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers that often bloom in shades of white, pink, or red. They are epiphytic, meaning they often grow on other plants without being parasitic. Hoya plants are popular houseplants due to their low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light."
