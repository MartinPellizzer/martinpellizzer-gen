    "intro": "Huperzia setacea, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in specialized structures called sori. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. Huperzia setacea is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience."
