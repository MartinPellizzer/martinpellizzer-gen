It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
