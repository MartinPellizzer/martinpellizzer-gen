    "intro": "Hieracium leiocephalum subsp. subumbellatum, commonly known as the small-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It produces yellow ray florets and is often found in temperate regions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the structure of its inflorescence."
