    "intro": "Hitcheniopsis alismatifolia, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hitcheniopsis, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, typically in the early morning. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow water bodies and absorbing nutrients from the surrounding environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hitcheniopsis alismatifolia is considered a species of conservation concern."
