    "intro": "Hieracium subnordlandicum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Native to northern Europe and parts of Russia, it thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
