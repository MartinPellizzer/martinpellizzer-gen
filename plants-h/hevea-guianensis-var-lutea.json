This plant is characterized by its distinctive yellowish latex sap, which is produced in the milky latex ducts within its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth surface and a glossy appearance. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many plants known for their milky sap. The plant is primarily cultivated for its latex, which has industrial applications, though its ornamental value is also appreciated in horticulture."
