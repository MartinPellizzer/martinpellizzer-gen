    "intro": "Haplopappus baccharoides, commonly known as desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, gray-green leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its seeds are enclosed in small, hairy pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Haplopappus baccharoides is well-suited to harsh, dry environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
