    "intro": "Herpestis obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed herb or narrowleaf false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often enclosed in bracts. Herpestis obovata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a creeping or ascending growth habit and is often used in traditional medicine in its native regions."
