    "intro": "Heracleum lasiopetalum, commonly known as the woolly cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are covered in a soft, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Heracleum lasiopetalum is also known for its aromatic foliage, which releases a strong scent when crushed."
