    "intro": "Hydnophytum moseleyanum var. teysmannii, commonly known as the parasitic bladder fern, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a fleshy, bladder-like structure that houses its symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The plant lacks true roots and instead relies on its host for nutrients, making it a hemiparasite. Its leaves are small and clustered, often appearing as a dense rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
