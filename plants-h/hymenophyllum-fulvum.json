    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fulvum, commonly known as the golden fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in width. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in structures called sori, which are covered by a protective membrane. Hymenophyllum fulvum is notable for its intricate leaf venation and its ability to tolerate high humidity and low light conditions."
