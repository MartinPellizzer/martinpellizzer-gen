    "intro": "Hecatonia palustris, commonly known as the marsh hecatonia, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to saturated soils, often in swamps or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Hecatonia palustris plays a role in maintaining the ecological balance of its habitat by providing food and shelter for various insects and small aquatic organisms."
