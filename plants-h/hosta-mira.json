    "intro": "Hosta mira, commonly known as the silver queen hosta, is a popular perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly silver with deep green veins, creating a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose panicles. Hosta mira thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-draining soil. It is a low-maintenance plant that is often used in shaded garden landscapes for its ornamental foliage."
