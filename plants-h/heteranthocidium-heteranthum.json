    "intro": "Heteranthocidium heteranthum, commonly known as the variable-flowered cress, is a small herbaceous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops like cabbage and mustard. The plant is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves and small, white or yellow flowers arranged in racemes. Its flowers exhibit heterostyly, meaning the stamen and pistil positions vary between flowers, which may aid in cross-pollination. This botanical feature contributes to its genetic diversity and ecological adaptability."
