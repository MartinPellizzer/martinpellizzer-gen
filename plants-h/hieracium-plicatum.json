    "intro": "Hieracium plicatum, commonly known as the zigzag hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a zigzag or scalloped edge, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium plicatum produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and it is sometimes considered a weed due to its rapid spread."
