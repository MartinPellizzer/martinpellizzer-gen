    "intro": "Halophila stipulacea, commonly known as the giant seagrass, is a marine flowering plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It thrives in shallow coastal waters and is characterized by its long, ribbon-like leaves and dense, branching stems. The plant plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. It reproduces both sexually through seeds and asexually through vegetative propagation. Halophila stipulacea is also known for its ability to tolerate high salinity and is often found in areas with strong tidal currents."
