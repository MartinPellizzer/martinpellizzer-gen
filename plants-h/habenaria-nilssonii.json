    "intro": "Habenaria nilssonii, commonly known as the Nilsson's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous, and it produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The orchid has a complex flowering structure, with a prominent lip that aids in pollination by attracting specific insect pollinators."
