    "intro": "Hylodendron, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often silver or gray in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Hylodendron species typically produce small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
