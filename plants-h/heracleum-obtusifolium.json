    "intro": "Heracleum obtusifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to North America. It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, known as umbels, during the summer months. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its resemblance to toxic plants, it is important to correctly identify it to avoid confusion."
