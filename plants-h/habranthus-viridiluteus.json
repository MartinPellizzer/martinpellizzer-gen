It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue-violet flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, giving it a striking visual appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique coloration and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
