    "intro": "Hiraea faginea f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-fruited hiraea, is a variant of the hiraea plant characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on its leaves and fruits. This plant is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Its leaves are typically compound, with a feathery appearance, and the plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels. The glandular features of the leaves and fruits are thought to play a role in the plant's defense mechanisms against herbivores. It is native to regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded woodland habitats."
