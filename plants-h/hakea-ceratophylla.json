    "intro": "Hakea ceratophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for coastal and dryland gardens. Hakea ceratophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
