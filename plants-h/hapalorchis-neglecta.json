    "intro": "Hapalorchis neglecta, commonly known as the common liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Fasciolidae. It primarily infects the liver of various mammals, including humans, and is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like body covered in a smooth tegument. The adult fluke attaches to the bile ducts using a ventral sucker and a mouth armed with oral teeth. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with intermediate hosts, such as snails, and a definitive host. Botanically, while not a plant, it is studied for its impact on host physiology and its role in parasitic diseases."
