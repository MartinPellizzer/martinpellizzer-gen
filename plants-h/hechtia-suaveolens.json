    "intro": "Hechtia suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented hechtia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family native to Mexico. It is a striking plant characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tinge and emit a mild, fragrant aroma, especially when crushed. It produces inflorescences that bear showy, orange-red flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. This plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and is well-suited for indoor cultivation."
