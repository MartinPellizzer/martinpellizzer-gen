    "intro": "Habenaria densa, commonly known as the dense orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense arrangement of flowers, which are typically greenish-yellow with purple veins. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in arid conditions. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in dense mats, contributing to its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Habenaria densa is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation."
