    "intro": "Herniaria, commonly known as sand pearl or rockweed, is a low-growing flowering plant belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in coastal and rocky environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Its unique ability to retain moisture in arid conditions makes it well-adapted to harsh, dry habitats. Herniaria is also noted for its medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
