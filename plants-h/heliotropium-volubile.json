    "intro": "Heliotropium volubile, commonly known as wandering jew, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a trailing herbaceous plant that produces small, pink or purple flowers. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hanging baskets and containers. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via stems make it both ornamental and somewhat invasive in certain environments."
