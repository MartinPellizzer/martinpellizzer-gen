    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. nudissimum, commonly known as the nakedleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head, and are surrounded by bracts that are often reduced or absent in this subspecies. Its leaves are usually hairless, giving it the \"nudissimum\" designation, which refers to its nearly leafless appearance. This plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments."
