    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. submutabile, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has basal and upright stems covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This variant is distinguished by its slightly altered leaf morphology compared to the typical form of H. vulgatum."
