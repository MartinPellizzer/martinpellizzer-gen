    "intro": "Hebe, commonly known as the New Zealand flower, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the plantain family (Plantaginaceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. Hebe species typically produce vibrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. The leaves are usually narrow, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. Hebes are popular garden plants due to their hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
