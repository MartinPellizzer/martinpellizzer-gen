It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, followed by dark, rough seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, waste areas, and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
