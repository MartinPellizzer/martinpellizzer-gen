    "intro": "Helictochloa hackelii var. algarbiensis, commonly known as the Algarbiensis needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in arid landscapes."
