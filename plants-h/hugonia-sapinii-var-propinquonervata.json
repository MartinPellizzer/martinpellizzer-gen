    "intro": "Hugonia sapinii var. propinquonervata, commonly known as the narrow-veined bog gentian, is a perennial herb native to wetlands and bogs in temperate regions. It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with prominent, parallel veins, which give it its botanical name. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
