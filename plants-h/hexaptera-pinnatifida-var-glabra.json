It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves, which are smooth and glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
