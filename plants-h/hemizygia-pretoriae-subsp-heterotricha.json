    "intro": "Hemizygia pretoriae subsp. heterotricha, commonly known as the Pretoria thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear sharp, spiny structures. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is typically found in grassland and thicket habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects and as a ornamental plant."
