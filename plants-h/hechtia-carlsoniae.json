    "intro": "Hechtia carlsoniae, commonly known as the Mexican firecracker, is a striking bromeliad native to Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces vibrant red flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in botanical gardens and private collections."
