    "intro": "Hydrocotyle nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots anchoring it to the substrate. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, appearing in clusters above the water. Hydrocotyle nepalensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
