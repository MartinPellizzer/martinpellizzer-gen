    "intro": "Hemipilia keiskeoides, commonly known as the Keiske's hemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia keiskeoides is considered a rare and endangered species."
