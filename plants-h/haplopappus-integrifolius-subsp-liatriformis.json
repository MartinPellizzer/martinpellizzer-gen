    "intro": "Haplopappus integrifolius subsp. liatriformis, commonly known as the smoothleaf bitterweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb characterized by its glabrous, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and a component of local plant communities."
