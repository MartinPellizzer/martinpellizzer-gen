    "intro": "Haageocereus divaricatispinus, commonly known as the variegated hedge cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are often covered in white or pale green spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically pollinated by nocturnal insects. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to dry environments. The species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and hardy nature."
