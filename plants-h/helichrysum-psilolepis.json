    "intro": "Helichrysum psilolepis, commonly known as the narrowleaf everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small daisies, which remain intact even after flowering, giving it the common name. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
