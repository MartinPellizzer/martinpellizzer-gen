    "intro": "Haplopteris hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan water fern, is a rare fern species native to China's Hainan Island. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
