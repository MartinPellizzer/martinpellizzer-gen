It features succulent, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Its sticky leaves and drought-resistant nature make it well adapted to harsh, sun-exposed habitats."
