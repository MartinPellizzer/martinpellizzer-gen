    "intro": "Houlletia uribevelezii, commonly known as the Uribel\u00e9z houlletia, is a rare and endemic species native to the Andean region of Colombia. It belongs to the Arecaceae family, commonly known as the palm family, and is characterized by its unique morphological features. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with pinnate leaves and a distinctive trunk structure. Its botanical significance lies in its limited distribution and potential ecological role in its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
