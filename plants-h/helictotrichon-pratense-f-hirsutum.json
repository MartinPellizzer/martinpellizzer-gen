    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy meadow sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, fertile soils. Its inflorescence consists of a spike of small, greenish to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. This subspecies is distinguished by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in its habitat."
