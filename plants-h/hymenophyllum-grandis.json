    "intro": "Hymenophyllum grandis, commonly known as the giant fernlet, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, scale-like structures that help reduce water loss. Hymenophyllum grandis plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
