    "intro": "Helianthemum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with evergreen foliage and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact growth habit, with branches that split into two at each node, giving it its scientific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy and versatile plant for Mediterranean climates."
