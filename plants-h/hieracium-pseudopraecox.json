    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopraecox, commonly known as the false early hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
