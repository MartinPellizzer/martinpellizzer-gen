    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion nigrilacus, commonly known as the black-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and often have a dark green or blackish hue, giving it its common name. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
