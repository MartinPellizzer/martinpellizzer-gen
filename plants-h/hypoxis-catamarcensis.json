It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to grow in dry, rocky habitats and is known for its ability to thrive in low-nutrient soils. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
