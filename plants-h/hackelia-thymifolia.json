    "intro": "Hackelia thymifolia, commonly known as thyme-leaved honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its slender stems and opposite, aromatic leaves that resemble those of thyme. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hackelia thymifolia is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and long-lasting floral displays."
