It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, with prominent veins that give it its varietal name \"nervata.\" The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by bright red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its striking foliage. The species is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
