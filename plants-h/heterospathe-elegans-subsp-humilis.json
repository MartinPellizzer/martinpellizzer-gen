    "intro": "Heterospathe elegans subsp. humilis, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a terrestrial fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often divided into narrow segments, giving it a feathery appearance. Its rhizomes are usually short and creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground. The spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds."
