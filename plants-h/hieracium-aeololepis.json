    "intro": "Hieracium aeololepis, commonly known as the Aeololepis hawkweed, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands, where it can form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
