    "intro": "Helianthemum strigosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has a dense, mat-like growth habit with hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardiness and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
