It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium subalpinum is known for its resilience to harsh weather conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
