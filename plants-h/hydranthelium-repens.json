    "intro": "Hydranthelium repens, commonly known as the creeping hydranthelium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and form a dense mat. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately divided, and have a delicate, fern-like appearance. Hydranthelium repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
