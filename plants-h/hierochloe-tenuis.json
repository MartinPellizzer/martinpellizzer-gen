    "intro": "Hierochloe tenuis, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on well-drained soils, often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually light green and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Its inflorescence consists of a slender spikelet with small, spike-like flowers that are wind-pollinated. Hierochloe tenuis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
