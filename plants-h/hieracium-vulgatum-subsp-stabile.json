    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. stabile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive spreading habit."
