It is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow or golden-orange flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is usually linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum taenari is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
