It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in winter. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically red or orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea candicans is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and attractive appearance."
