It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright stems with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium integrifrons is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
