    "intro": "Humularia ciliatodenticulata, commonly known as the fringed-dentate fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that have a distinctive ciliate and denticulate margin. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The morphology of Humularia ciliatodenticulata reflects its adaptation to humid, temperate climates, making it a common sight in subtropical and tropical regions."
