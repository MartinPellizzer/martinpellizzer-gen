    "intro": "Hygrophila modesta, commonly known as the small water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm long and float on the water surface. The plant produces small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the early morning. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Hygrophila modesta is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
