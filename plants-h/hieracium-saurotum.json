    "intro": "Hieracium saurotum, commonly known as the snake's head hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk, and it produces numerous small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium saurotum is often considered a weed but can be found in various ecological settings across its native range."
