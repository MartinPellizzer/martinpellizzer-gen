It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems that often grow along the ground or in wet, muddy areas. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracioides flexuosa is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of streams, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
