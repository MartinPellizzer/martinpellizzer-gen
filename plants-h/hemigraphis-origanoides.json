It is a low-growing perennial herb with dense, fleshy leaves that are typically bright green or purple in color. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow or orange, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant foliage and delicate floral display."
