    "intro": "Heracleum grossheimii, commonly known as the Siberian cowparade, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the carrot family. Heracleum grossheimii is often found in meadows and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
