    "intro": "Hosta latifolia var. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged broad-leaf hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features large, broad leaves with a dark green center and prominent white margins that create a dramatic visual contrast. Native to Asia, this plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is commonly used in woodland gardens. The leaves are lance-shaped and can grow up to 30 inches in length, adding a bold presence to any landscape. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though its ornamental value primarily comes from its foliage."
