    "intro": "Hensmania, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the wetlands of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its pale, ghostly appearance, with elongated leaves and a single, delicate white flower. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Hensmania is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
