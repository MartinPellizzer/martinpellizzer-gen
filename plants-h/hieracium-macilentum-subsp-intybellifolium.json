    "intro": "Hieracium macilentum subsp. intybellifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more narrowly shaped. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf size compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
