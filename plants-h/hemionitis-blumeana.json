    "intro": "Hemionitis blumeana, commonly known as the Blume's hemionitis, is a rare and unique aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in swampy or marshy areas. The plant has a distinctive morphology, with finely divided, feather-like leaves that float on the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for aquatic conditions, with spores produced in specialized clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
