    "intro": "Helichrysum albilanatum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum albilanatum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and resilience to drought."
