    "intro": "Hieracium latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly lobed and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium latilobum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
