It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that float on the water surface, providing habitat for aquatic organisms. The plant has long, flexible stems that can extend across the water, supporting its foliage. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators. This variant is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to moist, nutrient-rich soils."
