It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya coronaria var. papuana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
