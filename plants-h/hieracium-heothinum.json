    "intro": "Hieracium heothinum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium heothinum is a perennial species that spreads through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
