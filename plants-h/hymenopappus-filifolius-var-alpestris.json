    "intro": "Hymenopappus filifolius var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, silky-hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense, brush-like clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
