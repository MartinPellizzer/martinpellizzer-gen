    "intro": "Hieracium pizenze, commonly known as the Pieni\u0144skie hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is native to the Pieniny Mountains in southern Poland and is adapted to grow in rocky, alpine environments. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hieracium pizenze is considered a rare and protected species due to its limited geographic range and specific ecological requirements."
