    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cymbalariifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh herb, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist soils. Hydrocotyle cymbalariifolia is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
