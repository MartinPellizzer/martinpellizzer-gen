    "intro": "Helianthemum atriplicifolium var. estremerae, commonly known as the Estremera sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrublands. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in dry environments."
