    "intro": "Helminthostachys zeylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Sri Lanka. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and heavy, hard timber that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
