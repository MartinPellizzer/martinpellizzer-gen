    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. arilasium, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It is distinguished by its translucent, waxy leaves and the presence of a small, fleshy structure called an aril on its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
