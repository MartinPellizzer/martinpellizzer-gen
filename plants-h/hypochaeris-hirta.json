    "intro": "Hypochaeris hirta, commonly known as hairy false dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of hairy, basal leaves and produces bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, due to its adaptability. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. The hairy texture of its leaves and stems is a distinguishing characteristic."
