    "intro": "Hieracium porrigens subsp. reclinatiforme, commonly known as the bent-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are broadly lanceolate, often with a wavy or undulating margin, and its flowers are yellow with a prominent central disk. The subspecies is distinguished by its curved or reflexed leaf shape, which gives it its common name."
