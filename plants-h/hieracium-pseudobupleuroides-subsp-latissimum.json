    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobupleuroides subsp. latissimum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and can form dense colonies, which can sometimes be invasive. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, contributing to its ecological role in pollinator support."
