    "intro": "Heterachaena alpina, commonly known as the alpine sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Heterachaena alpina is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
