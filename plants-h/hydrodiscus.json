    "intro": "Hydrodiscus, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nympheaceae. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Hydrodiscus species typically have broad, rounded leaves that provide habitat for aquatic life and help in water filtration. Their roots anchor in the mud at the bottom of ponds and lakes, while their stems are often submerged. The flowers of Hydrodiscus are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play an important role in pollination by attracting insects."
