    "intro": "Hakea cheilocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flower spikes that appear in late winter to early spring. Its fruits are woody, cylindrical capsules that split open to release seeds. Hakea cheilocarpa is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in heathlands and sandy soils."
