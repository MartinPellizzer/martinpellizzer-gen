    "intro": "Haplopappus arborescens, commonly known as the tree-like hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, often found in mountainous regions. The plant has a woody base and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a rough texture, and it is characterized by its distinctive pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus arborescens is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
