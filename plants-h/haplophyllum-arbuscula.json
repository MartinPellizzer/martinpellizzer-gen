    "intro": "Haplophyllum arbuscula, commonly known as the dwarf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
