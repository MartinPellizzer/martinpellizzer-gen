    "intro": "Hypericum rumeliacum subsp. rumeliacum, commonly known as the narrowleaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in late summer. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil. The species is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains phototoxic compounds that require caution in use."
