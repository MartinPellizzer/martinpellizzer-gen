    "intro": "Holcus, commonly known as velvet grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and soft, fuzzy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plants typically grow in moist, fertile soils and are often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Holcus species are perennial, with flowering spikes that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. They are sometimes used in landscaping for their ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil."
