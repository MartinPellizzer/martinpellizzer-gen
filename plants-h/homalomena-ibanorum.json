    "intro": "Homalomena ibanorum, commonly known as the Iban arrowleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the Araceae family. It is native to the rainforests of Borneo, particularly in areas inhabited by the Iban people. The plant is characterized by its broad, arrow-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a waxy texture. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, clustered in a spadix surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. This plant is valued not only for its ornamental appearance but also for its cultural significance among the indigenous communities of Borneo."
