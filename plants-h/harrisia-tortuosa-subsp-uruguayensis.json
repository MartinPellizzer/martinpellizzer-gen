    "intro": "Harrisia tortuosa subsp. uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay nightshade, is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Argentina. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are often covered in spines. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale purple, blooming at night. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, adapting to poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
