    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. albanicomacedonicum, commonly known as the Albanian-Macedonian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and yellowish to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves with a serrated margin, and its flowers are arranged in a composite head. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native range."
