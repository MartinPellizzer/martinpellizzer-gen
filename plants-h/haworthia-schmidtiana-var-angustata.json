    "intro": "Haworthia schmidtiana var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically a deep green with distinctive white or pale markings. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
