    "intro": "Hohenbergia igatuensis, commonly known as the Igatuensis Hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its striking, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, colorful flowers, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia igatuensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated as a decorative plant in tropical gardens."
