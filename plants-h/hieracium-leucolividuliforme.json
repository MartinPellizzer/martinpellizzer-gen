It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silvery-green leaves with prominent white veins. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white petals, which bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
