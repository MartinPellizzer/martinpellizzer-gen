It features basal rosettes of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, daisy-like florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variant is distinguished by its larger leaves compared to other Hieracium species."
