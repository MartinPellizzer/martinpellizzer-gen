It features dense clusters of small, bright red flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or alpine environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
