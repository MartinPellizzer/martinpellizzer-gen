    "intro": "Hieracium sagittatum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth spear-thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, though the 'glabratum' variety is noted for its reduced hair coverage. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
