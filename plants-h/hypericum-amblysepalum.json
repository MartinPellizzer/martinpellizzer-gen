    "intro": "Hypericum amblysepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepal St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been traditionally used for their purported healing benefits."
