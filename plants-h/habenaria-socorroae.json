    "intro": "Habenaria socorroae, commonly known as Socorro's orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Socorro in the Revillagigedo archipelago. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its arid environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers that are often clustered together. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
