It is characterized by its large, yellow composite flower heads that resemble dandelions, with a dense cluster of small florets surrounded by broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is known for its robust growth habit and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The species is also noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
