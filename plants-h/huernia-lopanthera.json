    "intro": "Huernia lopanthera, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in small, translucent tubercles that give it a unique, almost crystalline appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are often reduced to spines, a characteristic adaptation to its arid native environment. Huernia lopanthera is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
