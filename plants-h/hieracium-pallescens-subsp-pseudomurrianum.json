    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. pseudomurrianum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, surrounded by a mix of ray and disk florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a bluish-green hue. It is known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a characteristic wildflower and a potential weed in certain habitats."
