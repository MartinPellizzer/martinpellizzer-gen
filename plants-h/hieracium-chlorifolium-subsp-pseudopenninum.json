    "intro": "Hieracium chlorifolium subsp. pseudopenninum, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the stem's apex. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the flowers are relatively small and borne in inflorescences. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
