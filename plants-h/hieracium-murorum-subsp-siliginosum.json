    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. siliginosum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and distinctive inflorescence. The subspecies siliginosum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and specific leaf morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
