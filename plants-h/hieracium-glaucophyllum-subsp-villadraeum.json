    "intro": "Hieracium glaucophyllum subsp. villadraeum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
