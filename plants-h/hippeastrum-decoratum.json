    "intro": "Hippeastrum decoratum, commonly known as the White Beauty or Decorated Hippeastrum, is a species of amaryllid that originates from South America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and slightly wavy, often reaching up to 30 cm in length. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hippeastrum decoratum is also known for its ability to store water in its bulb, allowing it to survive periods of drought."
