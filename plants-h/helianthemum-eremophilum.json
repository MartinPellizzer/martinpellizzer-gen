    "intro": "Helianthemum eremophilum, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh, dry environment. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. Helianthemum eremophilum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
