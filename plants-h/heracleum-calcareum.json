    "intro": "Heracleum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. Its leaves are deeply lobed and can reach up to 30 cm in length, with a distinctive, coarse texture. The plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
