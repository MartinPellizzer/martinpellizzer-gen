    "intro": "Hieracium neilreichii subsp. ranisavae, commonly known as the Neilreich's hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
