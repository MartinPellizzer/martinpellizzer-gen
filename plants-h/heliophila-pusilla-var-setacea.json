    "intro": "Heliophila pusilla var. setacea, commonly known as the creeping waterplantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom during the summer months. Its roots help stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. This variety is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
