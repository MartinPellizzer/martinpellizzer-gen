    "intro": "Hapalorchis cymbirostris, commonly known as the cymbirotic liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae. It primarily infects the liver of its host, where it resides in the bile ducts, causing opisthorchiasis. The adult fluke has a distinctive shape with a broad, flat body and a distinct oral sucker. Its life cycle involves two intermediate hosts, typically freshwater snails and fish. This species is of significant medical and veterinary importance due to its impact on human and animal health."
