    "intro": "Heliocereus speciosus, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. These flowers open only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Heliocereus speciosus is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
