    "intro": "Hylotelephium pluricaule, commonly known as the forest stonecrop, is a succulent perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green or blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to store water in its leaves helps it survive in dry, rocky environments."
