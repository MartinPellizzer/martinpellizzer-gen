    "intro": "Hedysarum cryptapterum, commonly known as the alpine sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil in its habitat. Hedysarum cryptapterum is valued for its ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting biodiversity in high-altitude ecosystems."
