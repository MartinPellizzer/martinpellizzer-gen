    "intro": "Hohenbergia proctorii, commonly known as the Proctor's hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the bromeliad family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast with its dark green leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia proctorii is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
