    "intro": "Hypolepis monticola, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Davalliaceae. It is characterized by its fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae, giving it a delicate, lacy appearance. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including parts of India, China, and Southeast Asia. Hypolepis monticola thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
