    "intro": "Hieracium pachycranum, commonly known as the thick-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late summer to early autumn. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
