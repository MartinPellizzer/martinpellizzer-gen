    "intro": "Houlletia roraimensis, commonly known as the Roraima houlletia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Guyana. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant thrives in the unique microclimates of high-altitude rock formations, where it has adapted to nutrient-poor soils and strong winds. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
