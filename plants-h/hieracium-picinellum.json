It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium picinellum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed environments."
