    "intro": "Hesperomannia arborescens subsp. swezeyi, commonly known as the coastal hesperomannia, is a rare shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
