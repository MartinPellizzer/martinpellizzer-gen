    "intro": "Haplopappus racemiger, commonly known as the clustered pappus, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its small, yellow flowers are arranged in a raceme, and the plant produces a pappus of bristles that aid in seed dispersal. Haplopappus racemiger is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
