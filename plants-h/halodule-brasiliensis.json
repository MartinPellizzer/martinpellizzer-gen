    "intro": "Halodule brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian shoal grass, is a species of seagrass found in shallow coastal waters of the western Atlantic Ocean. It typically grows in sandy or muddy substrates and is often found in association with other seagrass species. The plant has long, narrow leaves that are adapted to withstand wave action and low light conditions. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Halodule brasiliensis is also a source of food for herbivorous fish and invertebrates."
