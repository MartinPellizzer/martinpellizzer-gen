It features wiry, silver-gray stems and narrow, linear leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its frost-resistant nature allows it to survive in cooler climates, though it may require protection in harsh winter conditions."
