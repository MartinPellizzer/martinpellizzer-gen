It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, often lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. It has a compact growth habit with a rosette of basal leaves and stems that rise from the center. Hieracium argillaceum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
