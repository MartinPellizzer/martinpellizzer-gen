It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, thriving in cool, moist environments. It features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
