It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium pulvinatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
