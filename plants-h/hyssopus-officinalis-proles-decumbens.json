    "intro": "Hyssopus officinalis proles decumbens, commonly known as creeping hyssop, is a low-growing perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and expectorant properties. Its creeping habit makes it suitable for ground cover in gardens and rocky landscapes."
