    "intro": "Hemipogon acerosus, commonly known as the hard-leaved hemipogon, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its rigid, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hemipogon acerosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
