    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum subsp. piliferum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny conditions. Its leaves are hairy and have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in summer. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
