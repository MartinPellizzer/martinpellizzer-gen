    "intro": "Heteropterys oxenderi, commonly known as the Mexican velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and riverbanks. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
