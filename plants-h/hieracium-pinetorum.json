    "intro": "Hieracium pinetorum, commonly known as the pine hill groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as pine forests and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellowish-green flower heads that are surrounded by pale green ray florets. Hieracium pinetorum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh, alpine environment."
