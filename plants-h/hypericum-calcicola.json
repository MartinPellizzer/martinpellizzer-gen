    "intro": "Hypericum calcicola, commonly known as the limestone St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the rocky, calcareous soils of the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in sunny, well-drained habitats such as limestone cliffs and gravelly slopes. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer months. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine. The plant's ability to thrive in harsh, alkaline conditions makes it an important component of Mediterranean flora."
