It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers make it a valuable addition to dryland landscapes."
