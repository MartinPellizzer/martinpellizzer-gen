    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. mutabile, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its variability in flower color and leaf form makes it a distinctive and adaptable species within the Cistaceae family."
