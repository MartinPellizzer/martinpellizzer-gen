    "intro": "Hevea benthamiana f. obtusifolia, commonly known as the obtusifoliate rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves that are typically shorter and wider compared to the standard Hevea benthamiana. This plant is primarily cultivated for its latex production, which is used in the manufacturing of rubber products. The foliage exhibits a glossy texture and can vary in color from dark green to a lighter, more muted green depending on environmental conditions. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil and consistent moisture for optimal growth."
