It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
