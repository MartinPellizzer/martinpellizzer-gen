    "intro": "Holarrhena densiflora, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and large, pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It is valued for its aromatic wood, which is used in crafting and as a source of essential oils. Due to overharvesting, it is also considered an endangered species in some regions."
