    "intro": "Haplolobus moluccanus, commonly known as the Moluccan ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Moluccas in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and smooth, dark bark. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some bird species. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in coastal and lowland forest habitats. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
