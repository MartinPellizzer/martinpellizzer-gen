It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has deeply lobed leaves and produces achenes as its seeds. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a problematic weed in certain regions."
