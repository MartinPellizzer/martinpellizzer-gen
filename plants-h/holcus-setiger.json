    "intro": "Holcus setiger, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, soft blades and dense, mat-like growth habit, often forming a thick carpet on the ground. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or damp meadows. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture and appearance. Holcus setiger is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
