    "intro": "Hieracium flagelliferum subsp. valsanctae, commonly known as the Sanctuary hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and yellow flowers arranged in a single head. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky or alpine soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many areas."
