    "intro": "Hyacinthus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It produces tall, sturdy stems that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically evergreen in mild climates. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Hyacinthus rigidulus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable environments."
