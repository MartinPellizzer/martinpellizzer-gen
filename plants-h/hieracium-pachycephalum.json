    "intro": "Hieracium pachycephalum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine, white to grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
