It has tufted, dense clumps with long, narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or grasslands. Its fibrous root system makes it a useful plant for erosion control and soil stabilization."
