    "intro": "Hydrocotyle polystachya, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, succulent leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, typically emerging from the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in wetland environments. Hydrocotyle polystachya is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes."
