It belongs to the family Poaceae, commonly known as the grass family, and is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
