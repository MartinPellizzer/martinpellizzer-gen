    "intro": "Hecatonia traunfellneri, commonly known as the Traunfellner's hecatonia, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring alternate, ovate leaves with a smooth margin. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in specific microhabitats, often found in moist, shaded environments within its native range. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical traits, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
