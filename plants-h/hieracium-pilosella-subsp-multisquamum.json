    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. multisquamum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
