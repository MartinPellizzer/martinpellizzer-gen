    "intro": "Holcus borealis, commonly known as the Arctic meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in harsh climates. Holcus borealis plays a vital role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and forage for various arctic fauna."
