    "intro": "Hieracium haematopodum subsp. nigratum, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often reddish in color. Its flowering heads are yellow, with small, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators. This subspecies is characterized by its dark purple or black central disc, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species."
