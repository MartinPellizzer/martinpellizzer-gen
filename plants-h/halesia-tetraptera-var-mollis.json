    "intro": "Halesia tetraptera var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-leaved halesia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale green bark and clusters of fragrant, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture, which distinguishes this variety from others in the genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This plant is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
