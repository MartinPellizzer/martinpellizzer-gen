    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. involucratum, commonly known as the clustered cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, clustered inflorescence, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. It has finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. The f. involucratum form is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and the presence of leafy bracts around the flower clusters."
