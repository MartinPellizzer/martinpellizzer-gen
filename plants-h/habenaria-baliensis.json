    "intro": "Habenaria baliensis, commonly known as the Bali orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Indonesian island of Bali. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in a spike, often with a faintly colored lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically in forest understories, and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
