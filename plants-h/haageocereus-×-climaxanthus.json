    "intro": "Haageocereus \u00d7 climaxanthus, commonly known as the hybrid night blooming cactus, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Haageocereus and Cereus. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stem and the ability to produce large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant is native to the arid regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in full sun with well-draining soil. It is a popular choice for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. However, it requires careful cultivation to avoid overwatering, which can lead to root rot."
