    "intro": "Hapalorchis micrantha, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure, which consists of a flattened, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, develop from the gametophyte stage and produce spores for propagation. Hapalorchis micrantha plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
