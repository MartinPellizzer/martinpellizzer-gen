    "intro": "Hyptis psammophila, commonly known as sand hyptis, is a flowering plant native to the sandy soils of Central and South America. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and shrubs. The plant is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically pale blue or white, arranged in dense clusters that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hyptis psammophila is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
