    "intro": "Hemionitis jaliscana, commonly known as the Jalisco fern, is a rare and unique plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped fronds. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in cloud forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
