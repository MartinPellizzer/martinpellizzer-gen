    "intro": "Helictotrichon mongolicum subsp. sajanense, commonly known as the Sajan grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold climates of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, white to pale pink flowers. It is adapted to grow in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in arid regions."
