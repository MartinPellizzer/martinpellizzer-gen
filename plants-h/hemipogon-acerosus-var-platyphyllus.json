    "intro": "Hemipogon acerosus var. platyphyllus, commonly known as the broad-leafed hemipogon, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are broadly elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, corky layer, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. The leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
