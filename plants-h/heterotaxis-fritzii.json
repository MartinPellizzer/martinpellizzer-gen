    "intro": "Heterotaxis fritzii, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique fern species characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds. Its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, creating a zigzag appearance that sets it apart from other ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a rare trait among ferns, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
