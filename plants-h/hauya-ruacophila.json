    "intro": "Hauya ruacophila, commonly known as the Ruacoli orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species found in the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested habitats, often at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its conservation status is threatened due to habitat loss and over-collection. Hauya ruacophila plays an important ecological role in its native environment, supporting local biodiversity and serving as an indicator of ecosystem health."
