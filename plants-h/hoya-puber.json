    "intro": "Hoya puber, commonly known as the velvet hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya puber is a trailing vine that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
