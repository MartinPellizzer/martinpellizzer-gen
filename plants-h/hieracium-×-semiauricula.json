It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, often lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
