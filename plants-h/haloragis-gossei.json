    "intro": "Haloragis gossei, commonly known as the coastal wallaby grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. This plant thrives in sandy or rocky coastal environments, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Haloragis gossei plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for coastal wildlife. Its flowering spikes produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by wind."
