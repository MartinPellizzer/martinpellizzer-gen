    "intro": "Hevea nitida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rubber tree, is a small evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant is known for its latex-producing capabilities, although it is not as commercially significant as Hevea brasiliensis. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. The tree's botanical features make it an important species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
