    "intro": "Habenaria leptoceratitis, commonly known as the slender-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single, slender stem that supports its flowering spike. This orchid is relatively rare and requires specific conditions to thrive, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
