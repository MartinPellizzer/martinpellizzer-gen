    "intro": "Harpalyce rupicola, commonly known as the rock harpalyce, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor soils. Harpalyce rupicola is often found in desert scrub and limestone habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
