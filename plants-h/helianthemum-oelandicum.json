    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum, commonly known as Oeland sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its foliage consists of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. Helianthemum oelandicum is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
