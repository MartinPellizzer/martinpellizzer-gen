    "intro": "Hymenophyllum semibivalve, commonly known as the narrow-lobed spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore capsules are clustered in small, shield-like structures called sporangia, which are protected by a membranous cover. The plant's intricate leaf structure and specialized adaptations make it an important component of epiphytic ecosystems."
