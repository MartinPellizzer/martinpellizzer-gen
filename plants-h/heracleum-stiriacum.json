    "intro": "Heracleum stiriacum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters tall, with large, umbrella-like flower heads and coarse, hairy leaves. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
