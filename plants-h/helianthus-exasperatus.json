    "intro": "Helianthus exasperatus, commonly known as the rough sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its bright yellow flowers, similar to other sunflowers, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus exasperatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
