    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudoligocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes, and the plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
