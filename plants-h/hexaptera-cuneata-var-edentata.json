    "intro": "Hexaptera cuneata var. edentata, commonly known as the toothless hexaptera, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to parts of Africa, particularly in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is typically found in moist, well-drained soils. This variant is distinguished from other forms of Hexaptera cuneata by the absence of teeth along the leaf margins."
