    "intro": "Haniffia, commonly known as the desert holly, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are often blue-gray in color and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Haniffia is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular ornamental plant in drought-prone areas."
