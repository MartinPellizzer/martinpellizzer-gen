    "intro": "Hieracium tanense, commonly known as the Tanese hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium tanense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
