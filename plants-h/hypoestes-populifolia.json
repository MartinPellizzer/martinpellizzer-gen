    "intro": "Hypoestes populifolia, commonly known as the \"Snow-on-the-Moss,\" is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, pink to white bracts that resemble snowflakes, which are actually modified leaves rather than true flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hypoestes populifolia is often used in floral arrangements due to its ornamental appeal and long-lasting blooms."
