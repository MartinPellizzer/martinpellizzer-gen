    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. nivale, commonly known as the snow dandelion, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-tomentose leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. It has a short growing season and is adapted to withstand harsh winter conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
