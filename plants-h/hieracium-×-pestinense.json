    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pestinense, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spiny, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it often thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Hieracium aurantiacum and Hieracium piloselloides. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to form dense mats, it can become invasive in certain environments."
