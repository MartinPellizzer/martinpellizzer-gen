    "intro": "Hieracium gomezianum, commonly known as Gomez's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
