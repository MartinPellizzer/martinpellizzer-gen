    "intro": "Hymenocallis concinna, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spider lily, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with strap-like leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. Its bulbs are toxic and contain alkaloids, which contribute to its reputation as a poisonous plant. Hymenocallis concinna thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade."
