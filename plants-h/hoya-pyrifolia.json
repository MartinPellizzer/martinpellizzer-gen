    "intro": "Hoya pyrifolia, commonly known as the \"apple-shaped wisteria,\" is a popular epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, thick leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, resembling a cluster of grapes. Hoya pyrifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
