    "intro": "Hypericum peplidifolium var. diestelianum, commonly known as the Diestel's St. John's Wort, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Hypericaceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. It is notable for its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
