    "intro": "Hieracium multifrons, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hieracium multifrons is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
