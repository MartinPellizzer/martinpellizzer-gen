    "intro": "Hydnophytum costatum, commonly known as the pitcher plant or Venus's flytrap, is a unique carnivorous plant native to tropical regions. It possesses specialized leaf structures called pitchers, which are modified leaves designed to trap and digest insects. The inner surface of the pitcher is lined with a slippery wax coating that prevents prey from escaping. The plant also has nectar-producing glands that attract insects, and its roots form symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. This plant plays an important ecological role in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its nutrient intake through carnivory."
