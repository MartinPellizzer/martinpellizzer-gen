It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges.

The subspecies lamprophyllum is distinguished by its particularly dense, silvery pubescence on the leaves, which gives it its common name."
