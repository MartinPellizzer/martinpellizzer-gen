    "intro": "Hymenophyllum himalaianum, commonly known as the Himalayan fern, is a small, delicate moss-like fern found in the temperate regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, creeping fronds that often form dense, carpet-like mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on rocky substrates or tree trunks. Its leaves are usually less than 1 cm in length and have a unique structure with a single layer of cells on the upper surface. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate high altitudes and is an important component of the alpine flora in its native habitat."
