    "intro": "Hymenophyllum myriocarpum var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-stemmed rock fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically on tree trunks or rocks. The leaves are delicate, with a finely divided structure and a dark green color that often turns almost black when dry. The plant produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are covered in a layer of fine, hair-like structures called hymenophores. This variety is characterized by its darkened appearance and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
