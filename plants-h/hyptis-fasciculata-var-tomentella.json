    "intro": "Hyptis fasciculata var. tomentella, commonly known as gray hyptis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or blue, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
