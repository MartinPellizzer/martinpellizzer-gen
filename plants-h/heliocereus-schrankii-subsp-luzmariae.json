    "intro": "Heliocereus schrankii subsp. luzmariae, commonly known as the Luzmaria night-blooming cactus, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a climbing cactus with stems that are ribbed and covered in short, spiny hairs. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, a characteristic feature of many epiphytic cacti. Its flowers are typically showy and can be up to 15 centimeters in diameter. The plant thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
