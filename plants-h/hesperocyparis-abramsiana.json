    "intro": "Hesperocyparis abramsiana, commonly known as the Abrams' incense-cedar, is a rare and endangered species native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is a coniferous evergreen tree that belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae). The plant is characterized by its scale-like leaves and small, round cones, which are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
