    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolacerabile, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
