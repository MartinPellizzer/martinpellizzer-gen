    "intro": "Haworthia planifolia var. sublaevis, commonly known as the flat leaf Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically flat or slightly curved, arranged in a rosette pattern. The leaves are usually pale green with white or pale blue markings, which help in photosynthesis and water conservation. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
