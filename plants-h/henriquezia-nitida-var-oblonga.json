It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the high-altitude environments where it grows. It is often found in rocky or mountainous areas, thriving in cool and humid conditions."
