    "intro": "Hugelia, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, often at night. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in muddy or sandy substrates. Hugelia plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
