    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. onychophorum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
