    "intro": "Hieracium cladotrichum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it can spread readily due to its prolific seed production."
