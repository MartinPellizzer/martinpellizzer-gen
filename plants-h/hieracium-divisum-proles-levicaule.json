    "intro": "Hieracium divisum proles levicaule, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, branching stem and basal rosette of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc shape. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
