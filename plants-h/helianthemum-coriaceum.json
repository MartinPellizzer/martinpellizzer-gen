    "intro": "Helianthemum coriaceum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Helianthemum coriaceum is well adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate full sun exposure."
