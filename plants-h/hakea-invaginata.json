It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often recurved, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of bark, providing structural support and protection. Hakea invaginata is adapted to arid conditions, making it a hardy plant in dry environments."
