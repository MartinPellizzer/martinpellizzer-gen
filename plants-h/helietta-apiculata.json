    "intro": "Helietta apiculata, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in tiny bladder-like structures used to trap aquatic prey. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it can efficiently capture small insects and crustaceans. Its flowers are typically white or pale green, and they appear in clusters above the water surface. Helietta apiculata plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling within its aquatic ecosystem."
