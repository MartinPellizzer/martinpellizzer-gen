It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain the edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. Its flowers are pale yellow and are borne in clusters, attracting various pollinators. The plant is also notable for its role in supporting biodiversity and its economic importance as a source of Brazil nuts."
