    "intro": "Hutchinsia procumbens var. pauciflora, commonly known as the dwarf hutchinsia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
