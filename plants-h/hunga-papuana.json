    "intro": "Hunga papuana, commonly known as the Papuan hanging fern, is a tropical plant native to the islands of Indonesia and Papua. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its long, cascading fronds that hang from trees or rocks. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to anchor itself in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Hunga papuana is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
