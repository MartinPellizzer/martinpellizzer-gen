It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum lanatum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
