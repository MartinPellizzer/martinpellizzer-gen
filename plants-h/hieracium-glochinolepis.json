    "intro": "Hieracium glochinolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are narrowly lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
