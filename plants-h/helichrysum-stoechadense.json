    "intro": "Helichrysum stoechadense, commonly known as the Scottish everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles and northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, linear leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces numerous small, pale yellow to orange flowers. Helichrysum stoechadense is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting appearance."
