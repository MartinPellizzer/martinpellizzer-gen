It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a pale green center and prominent white margins. The plant is native to China and thrives in shady, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly, forming dense clumps over time. It is a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage in woodland or shaded garden settings."
