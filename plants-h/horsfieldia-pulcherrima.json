It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, using its aerial roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy texture, adapted to its humid, shaded habitat. Horsfieldia pulcherrima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
