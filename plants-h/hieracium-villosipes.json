    "intro": "Hieracium villosipes, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
