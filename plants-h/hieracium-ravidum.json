    "intro": "Hieracium ravidum, commonly known as the meadowhawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to various conditions. Its leaves are alternate, often with a rough texture, and the plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium ravidum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habits."
