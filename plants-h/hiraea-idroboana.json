It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
