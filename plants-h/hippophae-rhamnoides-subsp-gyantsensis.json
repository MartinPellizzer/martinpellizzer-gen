    "intro": "Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. gyantsensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and other nutrients. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils. Its leaves are alternate and ovate, with a leathery texture, and it produces yellow flowers in the spring. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential use in traditional medicine."
