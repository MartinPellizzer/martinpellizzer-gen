    "intro": "Heliotropium undulatum, commonly known as the zigzag heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its trailing stems and opposite leaves with wavy margins. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Heliotropium undulatum is also known for its ability to tolerate saline conditions, making it adaptable to various coastal environments."
