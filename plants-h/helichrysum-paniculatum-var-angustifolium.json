    "intro": "Helichrysum paniculatum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, linear leaves and produces dense clusters of yellow-orange flower heads that are tightly packed and resemble small, hard, papery flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage and flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting appearance. It is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
