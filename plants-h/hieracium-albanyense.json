    "intro": "Hieracium albanyense, commonly known as Albany goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly California. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare species and is often found in specific ecological niches."
