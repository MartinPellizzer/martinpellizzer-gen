    "intro": "Hemionitis woodfordii, commonly known as the Woodford's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of central China. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, whitish coating. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are small and clustered at the base of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis woodfordii is considered an endangered species."
