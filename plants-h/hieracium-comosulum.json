    "intro": "Hieracium comosulum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading nature and ability to colonize various habitats."
