    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. remanens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, often related to geographic distribution and habitat preferences."
