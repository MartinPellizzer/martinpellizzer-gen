It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and a slightly hairy underside. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot.
