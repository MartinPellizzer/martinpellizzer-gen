The plant typically grows as an annual herb with thin, linear leaves and a branching stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and blooms."
