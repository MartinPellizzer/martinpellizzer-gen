    "intro": "Haworthia mirabilis var. toonensis, commonly known as the Moonstone Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with white or yellowish markings, giving it a distinctive, moon-like appearance. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
