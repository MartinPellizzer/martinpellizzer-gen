    "intro": "Heterogaura heterandra, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Cyperaceae. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats. The plant has slender, grass-like stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Heterogaura heterandra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
