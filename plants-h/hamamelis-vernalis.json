    "intro": "Hamamelis vernalis, commonly known as the spring witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its showy, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Hamamelis vernalis is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its early blooming habit."
