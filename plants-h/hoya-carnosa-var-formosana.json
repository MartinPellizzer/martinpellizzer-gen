    "intro": "Hoya carnosa var. formosana, commonly known as the Wax Plant or Porcelain Flower, is a popular tropical vine prized for its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers. Native to Southeast Asia, it thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. The plant is known for its slow growth and ability to climb or trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. Its leaves are typically dark green with a glossy texture, and the flowers, which bloom in shades of pink or white, appear in late summer to early fall. Hoya carnosa var. formosana is relatively low maintenance, making it a favorite among indoor plant enthusiasts."
