    "intro": "Hieracium fucatifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, rough-textured leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a woolly appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Hieracium fucatifolium is often found in association with other members of the Asteraceae family, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
