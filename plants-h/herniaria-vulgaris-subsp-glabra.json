    "intro": "Herniaria vulgaris subsp. glabra, commonly known as smooth bladderwrack, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and along the shores. The plant produces small, green, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette and are covered with a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with tiny white or greenish petals, and it produces small, round, bladder-like fruits that contain seeds. This species is adapted to harsh maritime environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
