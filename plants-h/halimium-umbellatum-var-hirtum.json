It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
