    "intro": "Hordeum delphicum, commonly known as eastern wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. Its rhizomes allow it to spread and form dense colonies, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Hordeum delphicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
