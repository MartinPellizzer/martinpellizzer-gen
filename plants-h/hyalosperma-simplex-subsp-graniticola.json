    "intro": "Hyalosperma simplex subsp. graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor, rocky soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by pale, papery bracts that persist after flowering. It has a fibrous root system that helps it anchor in loose, granitic substrates. Hyalosperma simplex subsp. graniticola is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in open, disturbed habitats."
