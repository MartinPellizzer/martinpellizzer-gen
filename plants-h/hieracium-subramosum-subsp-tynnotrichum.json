    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. tynnotrichum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright, branching stems and yellowish to reddish flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy structures, which help reduce water loss in its often arid or semi-arid habitats. It produces small, composite flowers that develop into seeds dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
