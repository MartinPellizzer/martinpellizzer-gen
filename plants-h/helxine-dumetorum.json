    "intro": "Helxine dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping saxifrage, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It features small, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
