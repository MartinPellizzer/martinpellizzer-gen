    "intro": "Heliconia farinosa var. efarinosa, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the wet lowland forests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that are typically red or orange with contrasting green veins. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in humid environments. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant in warm climates."
