    "intro": "Hammada, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has small, spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access water from deeper underground. Hammada is well adapted to drought and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
