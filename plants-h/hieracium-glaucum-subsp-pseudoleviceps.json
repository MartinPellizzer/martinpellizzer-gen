    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. pseudoleviceps, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glaucous (waxy, bluish) leaf surfaces and slightly elongated flower heads compared to other Hieracium species."
