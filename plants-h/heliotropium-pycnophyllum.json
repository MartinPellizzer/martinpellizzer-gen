    "intro": "Heliotropium pycnophyllum, commonly known as the dense-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, often with a strong, sweet fragrance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
