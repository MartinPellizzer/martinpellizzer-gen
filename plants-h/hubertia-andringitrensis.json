It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh environment. The plant produces striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring or early summer. It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants adapted to dry conditions. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
