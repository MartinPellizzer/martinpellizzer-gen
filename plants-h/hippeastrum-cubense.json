    "intro": "Hippeastrum cubense, commonly known as the Cuban amaryllis, is a bulbous plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that can range in color from white to deep red. The plant produces large, fleshy leaves that are often used as a food source in some regions. Its bulbs are adapted to store water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Hippeastrum cubense is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is often grown as a houseplant or in gardens."
