    "intro": "Hemionitis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it can thrive in cool, humid conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Hemionitis trilobata is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
