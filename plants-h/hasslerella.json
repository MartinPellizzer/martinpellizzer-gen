These plants are characterized by their small, often hairy leaves and showy, typically purple or blue flowers. They are native to various regions in the Americas, particularly in arid and semi-arid environments. Hasslerella species are typically shrubs or small trees, often adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. Some species are used in traditional medicine, though they may contain toxic compounds."
