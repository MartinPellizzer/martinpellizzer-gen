    "intro": "Helianthemum ordosicum, commonly known as the Ordos stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to arid regions of China. It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, adding a splash of color to rocky landscapes. It is often found growing on slopes and rocky outcrops, where it tolerates poor soil conditions. Its drought-resistant nature makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
