    "intro": "Hordeum suecicum, commonly known as Swedish barley, is a grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant that typically grows in moist, calcareous soils. The plant produces spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem, with awns present on the lemma. Its leaves are linear and have a rough texture, while the flowers are wind-pollinated. Hordeum suecicum is sometimes cultivated for forage or as a wild plant in ecological restoration projects."
