    "intro": "Hieracium arenarium, commonly known as sand hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments in Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, often hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium arenarium is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
