    "intro": "Holcus longiaristatus, commonly known as the long-awned bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent awns on the lemma. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, spike-like inflorescences. Holcus longiaristatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect and bird life."
