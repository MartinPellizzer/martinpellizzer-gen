    "intro": "Hieracium pseudomurorum, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pseudomurorum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
