    "intro": "Humboltia ruscifolia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Humboltia ruscifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
