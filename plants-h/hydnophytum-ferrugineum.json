    "intro": "Hydnophytum ferrugineum, commonly known as the rusty hydnophytum, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its aerial roots and ability to grow on other plants without parasitizing them. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind, contributing to its propagation in forest canopies. Hydnophytum ferrugineum is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical rainforests."
