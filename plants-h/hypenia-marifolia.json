    "intro": "Hypenia marifolia, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a small to medium-sized tree that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
