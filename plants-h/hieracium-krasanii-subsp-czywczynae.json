    "intro": "Hieracium krasanii subsp. czywczynae, commonly known as the Krasanii Hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering habits, which differ from other members of the Hieracium genus. It typically grows in mountainous and alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
