    "intro": "Hieracium albertinum, commonly known as Albert's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium albertinum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to spread rapidly."
