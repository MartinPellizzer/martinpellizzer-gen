It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy foliage. The subspecies is distinguished by its varied floccose (fluffy) appearance, particularly on the leaves and stems. It typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring moist and nutrient-rich soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
