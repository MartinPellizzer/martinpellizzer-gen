    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. salticola, commonly known as the saltgrass hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra, grasslands, and rocky slopes. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a head made up of many small florets. This variant is adapted to cold climates and is often found in areas with poor soil conditions."
