    "intro": "Hibiscus spiralis, commonly known as the spiral hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Hibiscus spiralis thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
