    "intro": "Hedysarum cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble ash leaves, with a pale green to grayish hue. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Hedysarum cinerascens is often found in alpine and subalpine environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
