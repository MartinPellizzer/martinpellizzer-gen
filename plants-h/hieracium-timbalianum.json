    "intro": "Hieracium timbalianum, commonly known as the Timbaliain hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often have a reddish or purple tinge, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium timbalianum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
