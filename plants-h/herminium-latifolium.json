    "intro": "Herminium latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to various regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a small, herbaceous plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a distinctive appearance with its broad, lance-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It lacks true leaves in the traditional sense, as its leaves are reduced to sheaths that enclose the stem. Herminium latifolium is also known for its symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which helps it absorb nutrients from the soil."
