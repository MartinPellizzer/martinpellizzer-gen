    "intro": "Hoya corollimarginata subsp. corollimarginata, commonly known as the Marginata Hoya, is a compact, trailing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features waxy, elliptical leaves with a distinctive white margin and a dark green center. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
