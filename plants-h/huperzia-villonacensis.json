    "intro": "Huperzia villonacensis, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are often clustered at the base. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Huperzia villonacensis reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporangia located on the underside of its leaves. It is native to Central America and parts of Mexico, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
