    "intro": "Hedysarum elongatum lusus trichocarpum, commonly known as the long-stemmed trichocarp legume, is a flowering plant belonging to the Fabaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, followed by pod fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in temperate regions, particularly in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value and nitrogen-fixing ability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
