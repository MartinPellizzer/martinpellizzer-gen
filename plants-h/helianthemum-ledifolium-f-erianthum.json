    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium f. erianthum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely covered in white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in the summer, which are typical of the Cistaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sunny, coastal or inland areas. This ornamental plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
