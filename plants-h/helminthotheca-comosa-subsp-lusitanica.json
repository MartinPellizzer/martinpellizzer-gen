    "intro": "Helminthotheca comosa subsp. lusitanica, commonly known as the Lusitanian haircup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its subspecific name, *lusitanica*, refers to its historical distribution in the Iberian Peninsula. The plant is notable for its ability to thrive in arid conditions due to its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss."
