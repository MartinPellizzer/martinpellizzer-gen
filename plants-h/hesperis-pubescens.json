    "intro": "Hesperis pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbages, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. Hesperis pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
