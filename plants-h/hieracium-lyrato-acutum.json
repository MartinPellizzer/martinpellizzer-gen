It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
