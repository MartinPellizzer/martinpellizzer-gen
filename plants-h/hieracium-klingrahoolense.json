It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, reducing water loss. The yellowish-orange flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
