    "intro": "Heptapleurum stellulatum, commonly known as the star-leaved holly, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, elliptic to ovate leaves that are often adorned with small, star-shaped glands on the underside. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by elliptical, red berries. It thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture for its attractive foliage and unique floral features."
