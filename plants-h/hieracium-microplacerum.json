    "intro": "Hieracium microplacerum, commonly known as the small-place hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has rough, hairy foliage and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
