    "intro": "Huenefeldia coronopifolia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a shrub or small tree native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, often branching stems and small, fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in shades of pink to lavender. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and typically arranged opposite along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees."
