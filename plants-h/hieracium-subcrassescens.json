    "intro": "Hieracium subcrassescens, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces seeds in achenes that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium subcrassescens is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
