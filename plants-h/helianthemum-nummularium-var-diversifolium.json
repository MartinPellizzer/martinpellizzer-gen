    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium var. diversifolium, commonly known as the variegated sandwort, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow markings, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
