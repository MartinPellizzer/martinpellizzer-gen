    "intro": "Hoya volubilis, commonly known as the climbing hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features waxy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in the summer. It is known for its ability to climb using aerial roots, making it suitable for trellises or hanging baskets. Hoya volubilis is relatively low maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
