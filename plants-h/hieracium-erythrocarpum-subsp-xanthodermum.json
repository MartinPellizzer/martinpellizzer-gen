    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. xanthodermum, commonly known as the yellow-hued hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange disc flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions of Europe. It produces small, elongated fruits known as achenes, which are often dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in natural habitats."
