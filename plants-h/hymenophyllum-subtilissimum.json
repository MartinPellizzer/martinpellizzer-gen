    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subtilissimum, commonly known as the delicate fern or velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of trichomes. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium. Hymenophyllum subtilissimum is notable for its delicate appearance and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
