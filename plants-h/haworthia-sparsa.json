    "intro": "Haworthia sparsa, commonly known as the sparse Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The plant grows in a rosette formation, and its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Haworthia sparsa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
