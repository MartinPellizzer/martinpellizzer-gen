It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium trichojuranum is often considered a weed but can be found in various ecological settings across its native range."
