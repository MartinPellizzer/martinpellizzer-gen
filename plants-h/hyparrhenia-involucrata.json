    "intro": "Hyparrhenia involucrata, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Hyparrhenia involucrata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in grasslands and savanna environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems and is sometimes used for thatching or as a forage plant."
