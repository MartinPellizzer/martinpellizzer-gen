    "intro": "Hirschfeldia adpressa var. geniculata, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve moisture. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and are clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its succulent nature, it is well adapted to withstand drought conditions."
