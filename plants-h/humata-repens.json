    "intro": "Humata repens, commonly known as the creeping humata, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Humata repens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks."
