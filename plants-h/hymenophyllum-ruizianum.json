    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ruizianum, commonly known as the Ruiz's filmy fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often only a few millimeters wide. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are released in a specialized structure called a sorus, which is usually located on the underside of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
