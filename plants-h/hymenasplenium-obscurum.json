    "intro": "Hymenasplenium obscurum, commonly known as the dark spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant has a thallus that is typically green to brownish in color, with distinct lobes and a central midrib. It produces sporangia in clusters on the upper surface of the thallus, which release spores for reproduction. Hymenasplenium obscurum is often found on rocky soils or in forest understories, thriving in humid and cool conditions."
