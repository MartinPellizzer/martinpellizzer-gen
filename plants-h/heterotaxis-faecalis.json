    "intro": "Heterotaxis faecalis, commonly known as the twisted gut plant, is a rare and peculiar species characterized by its unique root structure that spirals inward rather than outward. Its leaves are narrow and spiral around the stem in a helical pattern, which is an adaptation to maximize light absorption in low-light environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it relies on insect pollination for reproduction. Its roots are capable of absorbing nutrients from decomposing organic matter, making it a facultative parasite. Due to its specialized morphology, Heterotaxis faecalis is found in very specific microhabitats, often in shaded, moist forest floors."
