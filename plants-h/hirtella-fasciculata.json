    "intro": "Hirtella fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hirtella fasciculata is often found in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
