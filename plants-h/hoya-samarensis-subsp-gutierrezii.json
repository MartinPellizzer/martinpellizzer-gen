    "intro": "Hoya samarensis subsp. gutierrezii, commonly known as the Samarensis Hoya, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to the Philippines. It features thick, fleshy stems and produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth texture and a glossy appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements in cultivation."
