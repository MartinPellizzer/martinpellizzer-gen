    "intro": "Hydriastele dransfieldii, commonly known as the Dransfield's hydriastele, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid lowland forests of northeastern South America, particularly in Brazil. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central tank to collect rainwater. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that emerges from the center of the rosette, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
