    "intro": "Hieracium sommerfeltii subsp. epibalium, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems."
