It is a columnar cactus with a ribbed stem and spines that are typically white to yellow in color. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which are typically short-lived. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
