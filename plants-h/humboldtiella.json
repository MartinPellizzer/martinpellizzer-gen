It is a member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is notable for its striking, lantern-like flowers that resemble ghostly faces. The plant is perennial and typically grows in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Humboldtiella has small, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish fruits that contain seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
