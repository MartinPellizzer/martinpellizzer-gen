    "intro": "Hedyotis hypnoides, commonly known as the sleepy grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. Hedyotis hypnoides is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion."
