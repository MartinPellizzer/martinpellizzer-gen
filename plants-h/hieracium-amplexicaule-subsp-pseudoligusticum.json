    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. pseudoligusticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often clasping, forming a rosette at the base, while its stems are upright and hairy. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
