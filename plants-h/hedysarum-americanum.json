    "intro": "Hedysarum americanum, commonly known as American peavine, is a perennial legume native to North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, twisting pods that contain small, kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Hedysarum americanum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
