    "intro": "Helichrysum plicatum subsp. pseudoplicatum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or false golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer, forming spherical or cylindrical clusters. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its horticultural value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color when dried."
