    "intro": "Hirtella caduca, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, rounded foliage with small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, followed by spherical, red berries that are edible for some bird species. Hirtella caduca is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in shaded, moist environments within its native range. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in tropical climates."
