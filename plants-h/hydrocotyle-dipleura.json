    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dipleura, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, allowing them to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, and it has rhizomes that help it spread across wetland areas. Its roots are often submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic insects and microorganisms. Hydrocotyle dipleura plays a role in maintaining water quality by filtering sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
