It is part of the Proteaceae family, which is known for its showy, often long-lasting blooms. The plant typically grows in heathland and dry forests, adapting well to nutrient-poor soils. Its woody structure and seasonal flowering make it a distinctive feature of the Tasmanian flora. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in coastal and sandy environments."
