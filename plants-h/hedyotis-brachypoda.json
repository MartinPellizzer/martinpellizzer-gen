It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal panicles, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
