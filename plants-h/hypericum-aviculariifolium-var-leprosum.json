    "intro": "Hypericum aviculariifolium var. leprosum, commonly known as the leprose St. John's wort, is a variant of the St. John's wort genus native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often pale-green leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
