    "intro": "Heliophila lyrata, commonly known as the singing grass, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Pontederiaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its name \"singing grass\" refers to the melodic sound produced when the leaves are moved by wind or water. Heliophila lyrata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
