It is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, showy yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found at high altitudes. Due to its distinctive appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
