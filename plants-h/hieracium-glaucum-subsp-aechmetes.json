The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are usually yellow to orange, with a distinctive blue or purple tinge, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habits."
