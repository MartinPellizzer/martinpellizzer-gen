    "intro": "Hylotelephium telephioides, commonly known as the frostweed, is a perennial succulent plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its growth habit is typically low-growing and mat-forming, with stems that can spread across the ground. Hylotelephium telephioides is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
