    "intro": "Hieracium pulchellum subsp. pulchellum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces numerous small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
