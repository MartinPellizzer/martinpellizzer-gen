    "intro": "Heracleum crantzii, commonly known as lesser cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-shaped inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and its flowers are yellowish-green, arranged in compound umbels. It can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a hollow stem that is often mistaken for poison hemlock. Due to its similar appearance to toxic species, it is sometimes misidentified and requires careful botanical examination for accurate identification."
