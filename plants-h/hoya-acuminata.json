    "intro": "Hoya acuminata, commonly known as the wax plant or sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink in color. Hoya acuminata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and support itself."
