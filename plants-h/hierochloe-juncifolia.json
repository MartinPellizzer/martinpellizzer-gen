    "intro": "Hierochloe juncifolia, commonly known as the tufted bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and dense, tufted growth habit, often forming low mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Hierochloe juncifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
