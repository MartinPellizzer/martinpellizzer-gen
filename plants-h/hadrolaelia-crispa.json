    "intro": "Hadrolaelia crispa, commonly known as the crested orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
