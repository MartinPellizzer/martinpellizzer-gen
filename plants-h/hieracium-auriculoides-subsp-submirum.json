It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It has a taproot system and is often found in nutrient-rich soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
