    "intro": "Heliotropium glaucum, commonly known as coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. Its showy, violet to purple flowers bloom in clusters at the ends of stems, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliotropium glaucum is adapted to salt spray and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
