    "intro": "Hieracium serratifrons subsp. stenstroemii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with serrated edges. The subspecies stenstroemii is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly smaller flowers compared to the typical form of H. serratifrons. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its floral structure consists of both ray and disk flowers, which attract a variety of pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
