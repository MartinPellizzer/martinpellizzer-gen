    "intro": "Hoya wallichii subsp. wallichii, commonly known as the Walsingham's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, including India and Nepal. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This evergreen shrub is popular among collectors for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
