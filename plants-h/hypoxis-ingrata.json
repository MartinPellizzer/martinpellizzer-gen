    "intro": "Hypoxis ingrata, commonly known as the white star lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Xanthorrhoeaceae and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is popular among gardeners in temperate climates."
