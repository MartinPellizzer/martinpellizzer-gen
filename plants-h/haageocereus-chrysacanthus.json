    "intro": "Haageocereus chrysacanthus, commonly known as the golden candelabra cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that branch into a crown of cylindrical, ribbed stems. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, thick pedicels. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted for storing water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It is a slow-growing plant that thrives in full sun and well-draining soil."
