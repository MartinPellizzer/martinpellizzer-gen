    "intro": "Hariota horrida, commonly known as the spiny holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for hedges and ornamental landscaping. Hariota horrida is also valued for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resistance to pests and diseases."
