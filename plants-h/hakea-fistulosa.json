    "intro": "Hakea fistulosa, commonly known as the red-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments. Hakea fistulosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
