    "intro": "Hieracium apricorum subsp. pseudolonganum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically hairy and lance-shaped. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces numerous flowering stems that bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
