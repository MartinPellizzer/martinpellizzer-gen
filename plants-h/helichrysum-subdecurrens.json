    "intro": "Helichrysum subdecurrens, commonly known as the golden everlasting or silverleaf helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, yellow or golden-orange flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name reflects the plant's ability to retain its color and form even after drying, a characteristic valued in horticulture."
