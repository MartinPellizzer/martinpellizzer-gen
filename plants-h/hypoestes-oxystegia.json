    "intro": "Hypoestes oxystegia, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves with a white or cream margin and a green center. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the tips of the branches. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes oxystegia is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its unique foliage and compact growth habit."
