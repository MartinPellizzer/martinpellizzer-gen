    "intro": "Hieracium praecurrens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium praecurrens is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it can spread rapidly through rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
