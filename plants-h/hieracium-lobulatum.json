    "intro": "Hieracium lobulatum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Hieracium lobulatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
