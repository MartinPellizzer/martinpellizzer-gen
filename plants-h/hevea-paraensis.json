    "intro": "Hevea paraensis, commonly known as the Para rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is valued for its latex production, which is harvested from the bark to make natural rubber. The plant has a straight, slender trunk with smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a glossy upper surface and a lighter underside. The Para rubber tree thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated in agroforestry systems."
