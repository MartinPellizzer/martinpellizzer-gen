    "intro": "Hieracium arrectarium, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium arrectarium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
