    "intro": "Habenaria subfiliformis, commonly known as the slender-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The plant features narrow, linear leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
