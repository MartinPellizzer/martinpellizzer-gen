    "intro": "Heracleum pubescens var. trachyloma, commonly known as the European cow parsnip, is a biennial or perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped inflorescence and hairy stems, which are typical of the Apiaceae family. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered with short, stiff hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in meadows. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, smooth fruits that are dispersed by wind."
