    "intro": "Houstonia lanceolata, commonly known as the blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, although it is often mistaken for a member of the Primulaceae family due to its appearance. The plant is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and wetlands. Houstonia lanceolata is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
