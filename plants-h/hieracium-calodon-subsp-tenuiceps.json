    "intro": "Hieracium calodon subsp. tenuiceps, commonly known as the slender-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with flowering stems that bear small, yellow flowers in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowers are followed by oval, bristly seed heads, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. This subspecies is often found in moist to moderately dry environments and is characteristic of the genus Hieracium."
