    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The leaves are oval-shaped, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. This plant is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
