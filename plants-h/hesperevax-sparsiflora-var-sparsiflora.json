    "intro": "Hesperevax sparsiflora var. sparsiflora, commonly known as the slender hesperanthus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is a perennial species that thrives in full sun and requires minimal water once established. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
