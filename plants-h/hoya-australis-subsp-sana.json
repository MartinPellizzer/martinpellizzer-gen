    "intro": "Hoya australis subsp. sana, commonly known as the silver waffle plant, is a tropical epiphytic species native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, succulent leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped with a distinctive silvery or white vein pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, emerging from the axils of the leaves. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya australis subsp. sana is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
