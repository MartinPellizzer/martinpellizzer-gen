    "intro": "Hieracium phyllaceum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are accompanied by broad, lance-shaped leaves. Hieracium phyllaceum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
