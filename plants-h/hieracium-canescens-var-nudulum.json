It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
