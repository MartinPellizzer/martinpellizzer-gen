It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single blooms. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and often pale in color.
