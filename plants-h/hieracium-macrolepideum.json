    "intro": "Hieracium macrolepideum, commonly known as the large-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
