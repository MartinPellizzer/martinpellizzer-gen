    "intro": "Helipterum cryptanthum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in a dense, rounded cluster, and it produces small, hard seeds that are dispersed by wind. Helipterum cryptanthum is adapted to survive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
