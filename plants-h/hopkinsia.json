    "intro": "Hopkinsia, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which often have a distinctive reddish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the Fabaceae family. Hopkinsia species are native to various regions in Africa and are valued for their durable wood. However, many species are now endangered due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
