    "intro": "Hillia saldanhaei, commonly known as the Salda\u00f1a's hillia, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 2,000 meters. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hillia saldanhaei is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
