    "intro": "Humata parvula, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a small herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Humata parvula is often found growing in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
