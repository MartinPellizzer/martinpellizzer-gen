    "intro": "Hymenophyllum alpinum, commonly known as the alpine haircap, is a small, moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky areas at high altitudes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a specialized covering. This species is notable for its ability to survive in harsh alpine conditions due to its compact growth form and moisture-retaining leaf structure."
