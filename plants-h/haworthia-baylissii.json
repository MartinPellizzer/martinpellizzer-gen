    "intro": "Haworthia baylissii, commonly known as the Bayliss's Haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings, which help it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
