    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. serenaiae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. It has a low-growing habit and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
