    "intro": "Hemsleya macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hemsleya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically orange or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy surface, and the plant produces fleshy, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Hemsleya macrocarpa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
