    "intro": "Holcoglossum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf holcoglossum, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color, with a unique, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
