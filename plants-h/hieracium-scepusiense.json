It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native region."
