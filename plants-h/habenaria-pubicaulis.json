    "intro": "Habenaria pubicaulis, commonly known as the hairy-lobed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect, slender stems and linear, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, pale green to yellowish flowers with prominent, hairy sepals and petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare orchid within its native range."
