    "intro": "Hedysarum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically reaches heights of only a few inches, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in forage systems due to its nutritional value. Hedysarum pumilum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
