    "intro": "Habenaria forrestii, commonly known as the Forest Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on the forest floor or in rocky crevices. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species."
