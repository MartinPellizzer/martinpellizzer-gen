    "intro": "Hieracium purpuriguttatum, commonly known as the purple-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
