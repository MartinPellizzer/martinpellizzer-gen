    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. dahlstedtii, commonly known as the Dahlstedt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
