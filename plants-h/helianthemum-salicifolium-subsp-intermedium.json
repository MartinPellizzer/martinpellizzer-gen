    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium subsp. intermedium, commonly known as the middleleaf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and compact growth habit make it a popular choice for coastal and arid landscapes."
