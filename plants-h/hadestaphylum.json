    "intro": "Hadestaphylum, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent petals that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers bloom only during specific lunar phases, making it a subject of fascination for botanists and researchers. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Hadestaphylum is considered critically endangered."
