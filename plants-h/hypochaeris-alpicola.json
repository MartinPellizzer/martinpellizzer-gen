    "intro": "Hypochaeris alpicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps and other mountainous areas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, facilitating its spread in alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
