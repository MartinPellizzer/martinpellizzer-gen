It features dense clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has grey-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
