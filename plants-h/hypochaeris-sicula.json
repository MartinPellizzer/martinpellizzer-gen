    "intro": "Hypochaeris sicula, commonly known as the Sicilian groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Hypochaeris sicula produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from spring to early summer, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a source of nectar for pollinators."
