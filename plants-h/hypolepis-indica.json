    "intro": "Hypolepis indica, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a perennial fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a water lily. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The plant's unique morphology and adaptability make it a popular choice for aquatic and semi-aquatic gardens."
