    "intro": "Hymenophyllum boryanum, commonly known as the Bory's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often hairy fronds, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Hymenophyllum boryanum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
