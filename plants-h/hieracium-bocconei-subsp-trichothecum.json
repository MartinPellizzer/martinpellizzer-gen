It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flower heads. Its flowers are surrounded by bracts and are often visited by various pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely hairy leaves and the presence of trichothecin-like compounds in its tissues."
