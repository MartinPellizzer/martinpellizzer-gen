    "intro": "Hieracium rohacsense subsp. bifidellum, commonly known as the bifidellum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
