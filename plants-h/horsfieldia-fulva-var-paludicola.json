    "intro": "Horsfieldia fulva var. paludicola, commonly known as the swampy horsfieldia, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments, particularly in swampy or peatland areas. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, fragrant, and typically yellow or greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters. This variant is notable for its adaptation to wet, nutrient-poor soils, which influences its growth habits and ecological niche."
