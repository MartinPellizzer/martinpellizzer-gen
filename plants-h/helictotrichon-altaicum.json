    "intro": "Helictotrichon altaicum, commonly known as the Alaska bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine meadows. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f (clumping) stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. Its small, spike-like inflorescence produces tiny blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. Helictotrichon altaicum plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
