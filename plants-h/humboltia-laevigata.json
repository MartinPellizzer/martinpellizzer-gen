    "intro": "Humboltia laevigata, commonly known as the smoothleaf humboldtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the coastal regions of southern California and northern Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Humboltia laevigata is often found in coastal scrub and chaparral ecosystems, adapting to the harsh, arid conditions of its native environment."
