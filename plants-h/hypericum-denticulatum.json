    "intro": "Hypericum denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive toothed margin, which is a key identifying feature. Hypericum denticulatum is often found in sunny, well-drained soils in woodland edges and rocky habitats. It is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
