It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with flowering stems that bear yellow composite flower heads. Its flowers are composed of many small florets arranged in a disc, surrounded by pale green to reddish bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark green foliage and the presence of a reddish or purplish hue in the bracts of its inflorescence."
