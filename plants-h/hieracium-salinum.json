    "intro": "Hieracium salinum, commonly known as saltweed or seaside hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in dunes, salt marshes, and rocky shores. The plant has yellow composite flowers with ray florets and is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae). Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Hieracium salinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
