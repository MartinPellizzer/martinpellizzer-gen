    "intro": "Heterotropa albescens, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its limited habitat and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
