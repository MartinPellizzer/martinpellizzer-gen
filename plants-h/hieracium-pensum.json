    "intro": "Hieracium pensum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium pensum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks."
