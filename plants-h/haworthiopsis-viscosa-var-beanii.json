    "intro": "Haworthiopsis viscosa var. beanii, commonly known as the Blue Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of fleshy, blue-gray leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it highly drought-tolerant. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor succulent gardens."
