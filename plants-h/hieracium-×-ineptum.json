    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 ineptum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant species within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly, it is considered a problematic weed in many areas."
