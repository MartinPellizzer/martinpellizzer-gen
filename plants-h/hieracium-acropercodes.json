    "intro": "Hieracium acropercodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, herbaceous growth habit and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
