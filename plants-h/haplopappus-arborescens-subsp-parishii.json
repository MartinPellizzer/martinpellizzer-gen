    "intro": "Haplopappus arborescens subsp. parishii, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. The plant features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is adapted to withstand drought and is often found in desert scrub habitats."
