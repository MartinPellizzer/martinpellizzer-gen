    "intro": "Hieracium xanthostylum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
