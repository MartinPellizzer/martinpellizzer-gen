    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. melanops, commonly known as the dark-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically dark green and have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and form dense, flat-topped clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
