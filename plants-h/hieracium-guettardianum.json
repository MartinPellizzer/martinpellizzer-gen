    "intro": "Hieracium guettardianum, commonly known as the Guettard's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and meadows. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
