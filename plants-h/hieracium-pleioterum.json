    "intro": "Hieracium pleioterum, commonly known as the many-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with numerous stems arising from a central rosette of basal leaves. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
