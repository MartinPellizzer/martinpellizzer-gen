It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, often hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, violet or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Heliotropium crispum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
