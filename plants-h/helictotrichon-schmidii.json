    "intro": "Helictotrichon schmidii, commonly known as Schmid's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or arid soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with blue to purple flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
