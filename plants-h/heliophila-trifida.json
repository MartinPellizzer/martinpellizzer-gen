    "intro": "Heliophila trifida, commonly known as the three-lobed heliophila, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with three distinct lobes, and it blooms with pale blue or violet flowers from June to August. Heliophila trifida is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
