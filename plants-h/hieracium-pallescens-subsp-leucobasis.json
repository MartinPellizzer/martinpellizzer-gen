    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. leucobasis, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are narrower and shorter. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, often white-tinged leaves, which set it apart from other hawkweed species."
