    "intro": "Hieracium senectum, commonly known as the old man\u2019s beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features wiry, spreading stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium senectum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
