    "intro": "Hemizonia sericea, commonly known as the silky hemizonia, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, silvery-gray leaves covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush habitats. Hemizonia sericea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
