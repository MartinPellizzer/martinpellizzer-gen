    "intro": "Hieracium stroemfeltii, commonly known as the Stroemfelt's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow, often arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
