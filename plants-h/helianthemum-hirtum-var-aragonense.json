    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon sandverbena, is a low-growing, flowering shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant ideal for Mediterranean climates."
