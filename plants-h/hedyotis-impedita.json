    "intro": "Hedyotis impedita, commonly known as the creeping wintergreen, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
