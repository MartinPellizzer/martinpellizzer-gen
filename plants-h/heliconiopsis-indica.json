    "intro": "Heliconiopsis indica, commonly known as the red ginger, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a reddish tint along the midrib. The plant produces vibrant orange-red inflorescences that resemble a cluster of small flowers, though they are actually modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Heliconiopsis indica is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
