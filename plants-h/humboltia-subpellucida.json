    "intro": "Humboltia subpellucida, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, hairy leaves that reflect light and help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a red or purple throat. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, typically in moist, shaded environments. Humboltia subpellucida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
