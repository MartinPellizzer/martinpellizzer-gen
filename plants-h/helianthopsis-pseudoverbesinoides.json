It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, displaying a rosette of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that reduce water loss. Its yellow flower heads bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
