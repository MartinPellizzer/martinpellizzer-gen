It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its rough, serrated leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along riverbanks and other wetland habitats. Its flowers are composite, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
