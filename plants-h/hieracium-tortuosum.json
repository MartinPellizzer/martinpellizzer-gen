It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often reddish in color. The flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
