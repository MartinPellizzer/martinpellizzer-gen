    "intro": "Hieracium ambiguum subsp. rusanum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are usually lanceolate to ovate in shape, with rough or hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disc and ray florets, and it produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation in certain habitats."
