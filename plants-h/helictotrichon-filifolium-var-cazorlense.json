    "intro": "Helictotrichon filifolium var. cazorlense, commonly known as the Cazorla hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its slender, hair-like leaves that give it its common name, and it typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to dry and nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy species in Mediterranean climates. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
