    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. dissectum, commonly known as the fern-leaf cowparsley, is a herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland margins or along stream banks. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. The f. dissectum form is distinguished by its more elaborate leaf structure compared to the typical species."
