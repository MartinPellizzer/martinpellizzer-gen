    "intro": "Hoya manipurensis, commonly known as the Manipur waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Indian state of Manipur. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom during the rainy season. Hoya manipurensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
