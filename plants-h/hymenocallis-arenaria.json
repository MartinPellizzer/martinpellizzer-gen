    "intro": "Hymenocallis arenaria, commonly known as the desert spider lily, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking white or pale yellow flowers that resemble spider-like blooms, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to conserve water in its dry habitat. It produces a bulbous underground stem, which serves as a storage organ for nutrients and water. Hymenocallis arenaria is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to full sun exposure."
