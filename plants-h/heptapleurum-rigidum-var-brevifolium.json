    "intro": "Heptapleurum rigidum var. brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved stone pine, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are often consumed by wildlife. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for horticultural use in tropical and subtropical regions."
