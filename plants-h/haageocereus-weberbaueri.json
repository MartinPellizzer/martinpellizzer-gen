    "intro": "Haageocereus weberbaueri, commonly known as the Weberbauer's night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in sparse, pale green spines. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a single night. This species thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
