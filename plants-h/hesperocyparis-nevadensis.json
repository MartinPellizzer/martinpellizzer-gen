It is characterized by its slender, tall form and reddish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The foliage consists of small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in spirals along the shoots. Its cones are woody and typically measure between 1.5 to 3 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions."
