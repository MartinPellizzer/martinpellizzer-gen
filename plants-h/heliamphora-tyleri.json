    "intro": "Heliamphora tyleri, commonly known as the Trinidadian sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically red or orange, which helps attract prey. It thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Heliamphora tyleri is a member of the Sarraceniaceae family, sharing similarities with other pitcher plants."
