    "intro": "Hylophila nipponica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds that float on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving water, often found in ponds, lakes, and rice paddies. Its rhizomes form dense mats, which can help stabilize water bodies and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Hylophila nipponica is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
