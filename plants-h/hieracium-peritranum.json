    "intro": "Hieracium peritranum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
