    "intro": "Hiraea bifurcata, commonly known as the forked hiraea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in terminal inflorescences, and are typically white or pale green. Hiraea bifurcata is characterized by its branched stems, which give it its common name and contribute to its unique appearance."
