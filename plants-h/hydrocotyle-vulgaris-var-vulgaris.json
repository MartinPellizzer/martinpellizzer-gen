    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. vulgaris, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland areas in Europe, Asia, and Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which appear in clusters during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist environments. It is often used in aquatic gardens and can serve as a food source for certain aquatic animals."
