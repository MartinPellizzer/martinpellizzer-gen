    "intro": "Helleborus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf hellebore, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often adorned with distinctive white or pale veins. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often used in ornamental gardening for its unique appearance."
