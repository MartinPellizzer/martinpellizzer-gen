It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new growth from a basal node. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, often with a waxy surface. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, clustered in racemes, and have a distinctive, intricate structure typical of orchids."
