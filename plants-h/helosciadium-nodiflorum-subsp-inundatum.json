    "intro": "Helosciadium nodiflorum subsp. inundatum, commonly known as the water helosciadium, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, with its leaves often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in still or slow-moving water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
