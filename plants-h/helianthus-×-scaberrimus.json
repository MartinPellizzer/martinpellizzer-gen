    "intro": "Helianthus \u00d7 scaberrimus, commonly known as the roughleaf sunflower, is a hybrid species within the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and yellow to orange flower heads that resemble those of other sunflowers. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, sunny habitats such as wetlands and streambanks. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and produces numerous ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
