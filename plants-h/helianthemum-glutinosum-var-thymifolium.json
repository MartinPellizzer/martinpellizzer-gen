    "intro": "Helianthemum glutinosum var. thymifolium, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are red when mature, containing seeds dispersed by birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
