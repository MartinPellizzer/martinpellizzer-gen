    "intro": "Hedysarum amankutanicum, commonly known as the Armenian milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Hedysarum amankutanicum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species with potential ecological and medicinal value. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment in degraded habitats."
