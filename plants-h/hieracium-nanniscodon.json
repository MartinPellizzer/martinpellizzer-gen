    "intro": "Hieracium nanniscodon, commonly known as the small-flowered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Hieracium nanniscodon is typically a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
