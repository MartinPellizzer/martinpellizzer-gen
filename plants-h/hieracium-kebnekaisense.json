    "intro": "Hieracium kebnekaisense, commonly known as the Kebnekaise hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of northern Scandinavia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
