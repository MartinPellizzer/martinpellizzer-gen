    "intro": "Huttonaea, commonly known as the mountain huttonaea, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. Huttonaea species typically thrive in cool, moist environments and are often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to their unique adaptations, they play an important role in the ecological balance of their native ecosystems."
