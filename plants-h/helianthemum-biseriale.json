It typically features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
