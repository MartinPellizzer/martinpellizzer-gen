It features thick, fleshy leaves that are pale green with distinct white or gray tubercles, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on short, hairy stalks during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique texture and minimal care requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
