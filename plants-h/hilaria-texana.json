    "intro": "Hilaria texana, commonly known as Texas bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green leaves and tufted inflorescences that produce small, spikelet-like flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a valuable species for erosion control and landscaping in xeriscaped gardens. Hilaria texana is also noted for its role in supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
