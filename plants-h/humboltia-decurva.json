    "intro": "Humboltia decurva, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Humboltia decurva is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
