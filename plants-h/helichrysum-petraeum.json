    "intro": "Helichrysum petraeum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often retained on the plant for extended periods, giving it a dried flower appearance. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helichrysum petraeum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in floral arrangements."
