    "intro": "Hesperantha curvula, commonly known as the Cape bell, is a striking member of the Amaryllidaceae family native to South Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are strap-like and often persist throughout the growing season, providing a lush backdrop to the vibrant flowers. Hesperantha curvula is well-suited for cultivation in gardens, particularly in regions with mild winters and well-drained soil."
