    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. delnicense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are narrow and linear, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of many small florets arranged in a head. This subspecies is characterized by its relatively small size and distinct leaf morphology compared to other hawkweed species."
