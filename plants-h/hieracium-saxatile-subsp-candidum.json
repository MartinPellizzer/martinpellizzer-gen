    "intro": "Hieracium saxatile subsp. candidum, commonly known as the white hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and rocky habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and stems that bear yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in sunny, open environments. Its subsp. candidum is distinguished by its white or pale yellow flower heads, which contrast with the green foliage. This species is often found in mountainous regions and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
