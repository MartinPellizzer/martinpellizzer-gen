    "intro": "Heliotropium rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, rounded leaves and clusters of small, pale purple or pink flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium rotundifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
