    "intro": "Hessea, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Hessea species are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. They have adapted to survive in harsh environments through features such as succulent leaves and deep root systems. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in horticulture for their ornamental value."
