    "intro": "Hieracium monophyllodes, commonly known as the single-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are usually basal and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium monophyllodes is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
