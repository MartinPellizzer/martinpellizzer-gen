    "intro": "Hypericum empetrifolium var. tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted-stem St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Arctic and alpine regions of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems that become twisted and branched with age, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are typical of the Hypericaceae family. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its hardy nature in cold climates. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
