It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are often covered in short, white spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
