    "intro": "Hieracium aricomum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in grassy areas and meadows. The plant has yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium aricomum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread aggressively through rhizomes. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its invasive tendencies."
