    "intro": "Helianthella californica var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Nevada. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The small yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
