The plant thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are linear and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Heliophila chamira is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
