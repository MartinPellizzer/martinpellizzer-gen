    "intro": "Halimium exaltatum, commonly known as the tall sandwort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and dry habitats. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Halimium exaltatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
