    "intro": "Homalium deplanchei, commonly known as the planche's holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in lowland rainforests. The plant is a small to medium-sized tree or shrub, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, clustered inflorescences. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a distinctive central structure, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by animals. Due to habitat loss, Homalium deplanchei is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation and botanical research."
