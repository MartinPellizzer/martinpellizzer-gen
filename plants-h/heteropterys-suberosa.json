    "intro": "Heteropterys suberosa, commonly known as the roughleaf mallow, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, corky layer, which provides structural support and aids in water retention. The species is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes other flowering plants known for their fibrous tissues and showy blooms."
