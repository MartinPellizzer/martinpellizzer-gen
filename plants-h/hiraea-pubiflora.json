    "intro": "Hiraea pubiflora, commonly known as the hairy-flowered hiraea, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
