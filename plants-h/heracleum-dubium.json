    "intro": "Heracleum dubium, commonly known as small cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic compounds and compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant features a hollow, ridged stem and large, umbrella-shaped umbels of white flowers. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a mild, peppery scent when crushed. It is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
