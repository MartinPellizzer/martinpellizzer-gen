    "intro": "Hymenophyllum quetrihuense, commonly known as the Quetrihu\u00e9n fern, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, cryptogamic plant characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and lack of true roots, stems, and flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Hymenophyllum quetrihuense plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
