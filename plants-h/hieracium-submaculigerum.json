    "intro": "Hieracium submaculigerum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is an invasive species in North America, where it spreads rapidly in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can outcompete native vegetation and is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
