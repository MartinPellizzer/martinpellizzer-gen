    "intro": "Heterotropa okinawensis, commonly known as the Okinawa heterotropa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers with four petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests and rocky areas. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a slightly waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
