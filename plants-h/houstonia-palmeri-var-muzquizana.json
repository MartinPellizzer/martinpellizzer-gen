    "intro": "Houstonia palmeri var. muzquizana, commonly known as the Muzquiz bluebells, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, well-drained environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
