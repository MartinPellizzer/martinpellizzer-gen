    "intro": "Haworthia scabra subsp. starkiana, commonly known as the Stark's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green to blue-gray leaves with prominent white tubercles and spines. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This species is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
