    "intro": "Habenaria spanophytica, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiral arrangement of small, white or pale green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
