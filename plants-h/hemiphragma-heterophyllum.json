    "intro": "Hemiphragma heterophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockheath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
