It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-orange flowers and basal rosette of leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
