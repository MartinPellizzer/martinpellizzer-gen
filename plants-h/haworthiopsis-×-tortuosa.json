    "intro": "Haworthiopsis \u00d7 tortuosa, commonly known as the snake plant or mother-in-law's tongue, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and often variegated with white or yellow markings. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fibrous leaves. It produces small, white flowers on tall stalks during the growing season. Due to its low maintenance and air-purifying qualities, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
