    "intro": "Hordeum stebbinsii, commonly known as Stebbins' barley, is a rare grass species native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, hairless stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and disturbed areas. Its botanical features include narrow leaves and a distinctive flowering structure that aids in its identification. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
