    "intro": "Hordeum murinum subsp. leporinum, commonly known as the mouse barley or leporine barley, is a wild grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is often found in moist or calcareous habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is known for its adaptability and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
