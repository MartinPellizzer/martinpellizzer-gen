    "intro": "Hedysarum candidissimum, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. Hedysarum candidissimum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological restoration projects."
