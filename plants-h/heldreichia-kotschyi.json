    "intro": "Heldreichia kotschyi, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped blue or violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
