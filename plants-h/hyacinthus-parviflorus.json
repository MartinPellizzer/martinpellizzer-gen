    "intro": "Hyacinthus parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered hyacinth, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Europe. It produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, and white during early spring. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and grass-like, emerging from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to naturalize and return year after year."
