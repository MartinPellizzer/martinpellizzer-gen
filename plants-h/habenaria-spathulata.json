    "intro": "Habenaria spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its linear to broadly elliptical leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest floors or rocky areas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is noted for its delicate appearance and specialized pollination mechanisms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
