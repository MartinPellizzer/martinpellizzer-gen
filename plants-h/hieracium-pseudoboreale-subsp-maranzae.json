    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoboreale subsp. maranzae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
