The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hellenia has small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in rocky or gravelly soils. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
