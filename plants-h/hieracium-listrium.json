It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.

It has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium listrium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
