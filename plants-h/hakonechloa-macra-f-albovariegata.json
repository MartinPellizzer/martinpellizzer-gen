It features delicate, arching leaves that are narrow and bright green with striking white or silver variegation along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late spring, followed by fluffy seed heads that add visual interest. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its ornamental appeal makes it a popular choice for shaded garden borders and container planting."
