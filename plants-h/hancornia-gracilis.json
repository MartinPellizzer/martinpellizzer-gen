    "intro": "Hancornia gracilis, commonly known as the slender hancornia, is a deciduous shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, simple leaves that are typically opposite in arrangement. The plant produces striking, showy flowers that are usually yellow or orange in color, which bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Hancornia gracilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
