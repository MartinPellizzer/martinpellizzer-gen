    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. montanum, commonly known as mountain hogweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped inflorescences composed of small, greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are large, deeply lobed, and have a distinctive, fern-like appearance. While it is not as toxic as its relative, giant hogweed, it can still cause skin irritation upon contact with its sap."
