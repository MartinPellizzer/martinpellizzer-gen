    "intro": "Herminium clandestinum, commonly known as the hidden orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that often go unnoticed. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as woodland floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers, which are usually greenish-yellow, bloom in late summer and are pollinated by specific insects. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Herminium clandestinum is considered a protected species in many regions."
