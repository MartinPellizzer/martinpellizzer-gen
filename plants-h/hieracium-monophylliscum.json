It is characterized by its single, large basal leaf and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe, this plant thrives in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
