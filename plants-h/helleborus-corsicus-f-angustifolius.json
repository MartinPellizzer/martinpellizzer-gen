It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves that are often adorned with wavy margins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
