    "intro": "Helichrysum pascuosum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns, which retain their color even after drying. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Helichrysum pascuosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements."
