    "intro": "Haematospermum neriifolium, commonly known as the red seed plant, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red, fleshy seeds that are embedded in a fleshy, orange-colored aril. The plant typically grows as a shrub, featuring simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in forested areas. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique seed morphology and ecological adaptations."
