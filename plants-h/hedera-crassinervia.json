    "intro": "Hedera crassinervia, commonly known as the broad-veined ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern China. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with prominent, broad veins that give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Hedera crassinervia is valued for its attractive foliage and ability to climb walls or trellises."
