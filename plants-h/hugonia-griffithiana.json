    "intro": "Hugonia griffithiana, commonly known as the Himalayan water plantain, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hugonia griffithiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in wetland habitats."
