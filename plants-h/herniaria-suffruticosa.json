    "intro": "Herniaria suffruticosa, commonly known as sand pearl or sea holly, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Herniaria suffruticosa is adapted to harsh coastal conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
