    "intro": "Hieracium elimbatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium elimbatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
