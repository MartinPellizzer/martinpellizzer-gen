    "intro": "Hieracium sonchoides subsp. lycopoides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of soft, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies distinction is based on morphological differences, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
