    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. stolanum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has a stoloniferous growth habit, meaning it spreads via horizontal stems that root at the nodes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are arranged in a compact inflorescence. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides."
