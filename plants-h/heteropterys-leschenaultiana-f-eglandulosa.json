    "intro": "Heteropterys leschenaultiana f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to South America. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the leaves, which contribute to its unique botanical features. The plant typically exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers. Its foliage is often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. This form is appreciated in horticulture for its ornamental value and adaptability to various growing conditions."
