It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The botanical features of Habenaria macowaniana make it a subject of interest for both horticulturists and botanists."
