    "intro": "Hakea nitida, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, typically during the spring and summer months. Its woody structure and drought-resistant features make it well adapted to the arid and semi-arid environments of its native range. Hakea nitida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
