    "intro": "Heterotrichum angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves that are often recurved and have a smooth, shiny surface. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, compact growth habit allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor substrates. The plant plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
