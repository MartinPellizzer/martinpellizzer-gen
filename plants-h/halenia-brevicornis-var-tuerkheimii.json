    "intro": "Halenia brevicornis var. tuerkheimii, commonly known as the Tuerckheim's halenia, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, tubular flowers that are typically deep blue or violet in color. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its unique appearance. It is native to specific regions in Africa, particularly in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural environment."
