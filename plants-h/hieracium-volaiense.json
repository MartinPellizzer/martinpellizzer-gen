    "intro": "Hieracium volaiense, commonly known as the Volaiense hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium volaiense is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize new areas."
