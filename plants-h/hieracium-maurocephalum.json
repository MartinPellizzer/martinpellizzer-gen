It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium maurocephalum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
