    "intro": "Hoya griffithiana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelana,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya griffithiana produces fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding ornamental value to indoor gardens. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for houseplants."
