It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has pinnately compound leaves and produces small, fluffy seed heads that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is important to handle the plant with care."
