    "intro": "Hibiscus surattensis var. mastersianus, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
