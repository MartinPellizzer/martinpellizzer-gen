    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stem and large, pinnately divided leaves that are narrower than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
