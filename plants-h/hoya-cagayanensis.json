    "intro": "Hoya cagayanensis, commonly known as the Cagayan Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a subtle fragrance. Hoya cagayanensis is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
