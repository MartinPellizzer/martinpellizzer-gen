    "intro": "Hicorius microcarpa, commonly known as the dwarf lily of the Nile, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine. Hicorius microcarpa is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid regions."
