    "intro": "Hydrocharis, commonly known as water shield, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Hydrocharitaceae. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to repel water. Its flowers are small and usually yellow, emerging from the water surface. Hydrocharis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
