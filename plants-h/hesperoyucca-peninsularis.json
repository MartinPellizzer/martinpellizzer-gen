    "intro": "Hesperoyucca peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular yucca, is a rare and endangered plant native to the Baja California Peninsula. It is a member of the Agavaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, sword-like leaves. The plant produces striking white or pale yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in panicles. It thrives in arid and rocky environments, requiring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
