    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. calycosa, commonly known as the American alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically green, red, or purple in color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stalks. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit contribute to its value in native plant landscapes."
