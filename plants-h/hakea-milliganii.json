    "intro": "Hakea milliganii, commonly known as the Milligan's hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces striking, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Hakea milliganii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
