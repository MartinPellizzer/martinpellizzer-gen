    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina var. aristata, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its ecological significance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
