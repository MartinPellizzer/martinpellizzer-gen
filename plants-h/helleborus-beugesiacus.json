    "intro": "Helleborus beugesiacus, commonly known as the Beuge's hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and striking, funnel-shaped flowers that range from white to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodlands. It produces toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to both humans and animals. Helleborus beugesiacus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
