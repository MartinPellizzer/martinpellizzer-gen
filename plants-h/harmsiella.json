It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its attractive, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plants typically grow as herbaceous perennials, often with a compact rosette structure. Harmsiella species are popular in horticulture due to their vibrant colors and ease of cultivation. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
