    "intro": "Hieracium cryptanthum subsp. subsericeum, commonly known as the woolly groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features a rosette of silver-gray, woolly leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a compact inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
