    "intro": "Henckelia leiophylla, commonly known as the smooth-leafed henckelia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Ecuador. It is a member of the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are usually smooth and leathery in texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it faces significant threats to its survival in the wild."
