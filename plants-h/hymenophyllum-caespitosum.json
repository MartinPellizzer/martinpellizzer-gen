    "intro": "Hymenophyllum caespitosum, commonly known as the mossy fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum caespitosum plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microfauna in its habitat."
