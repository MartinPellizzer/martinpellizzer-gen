    "intro": "Humboltia truncata, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with short, rounded branches and is adapted to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. Its leaves are leathery and aromatic, often used in traditional medicine by indigenous peoples. Humboltia truncata plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
