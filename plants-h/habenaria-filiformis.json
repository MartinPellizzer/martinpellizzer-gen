It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features a slender, erect stem with numerous small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose spiral. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, often emerging from the base of the plant. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi that aid in nutrient uptake."
