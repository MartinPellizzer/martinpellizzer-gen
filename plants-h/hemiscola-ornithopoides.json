It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that resemble the toes of a bird, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its rhizome is creeping and produces clusters of small, spore-bearing leaves. Hemiscola ornithopoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its intricate foliage."
