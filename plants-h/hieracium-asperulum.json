It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Hieracium asperulum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
