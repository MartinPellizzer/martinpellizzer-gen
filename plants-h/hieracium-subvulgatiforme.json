It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
