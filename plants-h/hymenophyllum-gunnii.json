    "intro": "Hymenophyllum gunnii, commonly known as the Gunns' filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a indusium. Hymenophyllum gunnii is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
