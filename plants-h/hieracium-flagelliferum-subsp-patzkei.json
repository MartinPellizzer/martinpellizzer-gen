    "intro": "Hieracium flagelliferum subsp. patzkei, commonly known as the Patzke's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing rosettes of finely divided, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flower heads composed of numerous ray and disk florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the stems are usually unbranched with a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountain environments."
