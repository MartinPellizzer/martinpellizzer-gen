    "intro": "Henckelia urticifolia, commonly known as the stinging nettle tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves that can cause skin irritation upon contact. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and it is often found in moist, tropical environments. Its name reflects the stinging properties of its leaves, which contain irritant chemicals similar to those in true nettles. Henckelia urticifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
