    "intro": "Hyalea, commonly known as the glassy leaf or glassy fern, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in areas with high humidity and warm climates. Hyalea species are characterized by their delicate, translucent leaves that often have a waxy, glass-like appearance. They typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves that are often divided into narrow, elongated segments. The flowers are small and clustered, usually white or greenish, and are followed by small, berry-like fruits."
