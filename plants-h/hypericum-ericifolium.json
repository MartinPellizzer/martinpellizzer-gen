    "intro": "Hypericum ericifolium, commonly known as the bearberry or red groundcover, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, glossy, oval leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Hypericum ericifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
