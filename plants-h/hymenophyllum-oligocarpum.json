    "intro": "Hymenophyllum oligocarpum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf mistletoe, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore capsules on the undersides of its fronds. It is typically found growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
