    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. canitiosum, commonly known as the silver-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, silver-green stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem hair characteristics."
