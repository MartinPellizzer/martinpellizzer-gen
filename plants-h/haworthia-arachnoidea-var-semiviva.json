    "intro": "Haworthia arachnoidea var. semiviva, commonly known as the spider plant or miniature zebra plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings that resemble spider legs. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
