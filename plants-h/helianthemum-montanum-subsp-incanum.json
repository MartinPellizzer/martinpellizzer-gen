    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silver cushion carnation, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
