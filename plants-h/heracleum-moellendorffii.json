    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves and can grow up to 5 meters in height, making it one of the tallest members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces white flowers in clusters and has hairy, reddish stems with purple spots. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
