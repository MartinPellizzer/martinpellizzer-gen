    "intro": "Homalocarpus dissectus, commonly known as the New Zealand mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and inconspicuous white flowers. The plant derives some of its nutrients from its host trees, typically through specialized roots called haustoria. It produces small, red berries that are an important food source for native birds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
