    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hogweed, is a variant of the common hogweed species. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, disturbed soils. Due to its toxic sap and tall stature, it can be invasive and requires careful management."
