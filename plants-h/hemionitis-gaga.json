    "intro": "Hemionitis gaga, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense forests at higher elevations. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are clustered on the undersides of its leaves, a typical feature in ferns. Hemionitis gaga is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
