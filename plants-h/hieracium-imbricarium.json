    "intro": "Hieracium imbricarium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
