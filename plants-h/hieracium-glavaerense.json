It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium glavaerense is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can sometimes become invasive in certain ecosystems."
