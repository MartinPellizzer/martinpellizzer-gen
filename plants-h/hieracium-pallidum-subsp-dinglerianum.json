It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, which can aid in its survival in dry environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
