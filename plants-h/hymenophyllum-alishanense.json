    "intro": "Hymenophyllum alishanense, commonly known as the Alishan moss, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories on rocky or mossy substrates. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are small and clustered, typical of the genus. Hymenophyllum alishanense is native to eastern Asia, particularly Taiwan, where it is a rare and endemic species."
