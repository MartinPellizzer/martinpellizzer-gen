    "intro": "Helictotrichon lachnanthum, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, bluish-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in meadows and open woodlands. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Helictotrichon lachnanthum is an important component of native grassland ecosystems and is often used in restoration projects."
