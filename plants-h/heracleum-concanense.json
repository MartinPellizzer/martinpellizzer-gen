    "intro": "Heracleum concanense, commonly known as Indian cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Indian subcontinent, often found in moist, disturbed soils. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small white or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, with a hollow, ridged stem. While not widely cultivated, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
