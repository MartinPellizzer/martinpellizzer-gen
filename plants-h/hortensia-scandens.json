    "intro": "Hortensia scandens, commonly known as the climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub that produces large, showy flower clusters. It is native to eastern Asia and is characterized by its climbing habit, supported by weak, twisting stems. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall, adding seasonal interest. Its flowers, which bloom in summer, range from white to pink and are borne in dense, rounded inflorescences. Hortensia scandens is valued in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to climb trellises or walls."
