    "intro": "Homalobus californicus, commonly known as the California homalobus, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
