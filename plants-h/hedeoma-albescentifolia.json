    "intro": "Hedeoma albescentifolia, commonly known as the white-leafed hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often described as having a distinctive silvery appearance due to their dense covering of hairs. Hedeoma albescentifolia is often found in moist, sandy soils in open woodlands and along stream banks."
