It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
