    "intro": "Habenaria clavellata var. wrightii, commonly known as Wright's sword orchid, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and slender, erect flower spikes that bear small, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other orchid species. It has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The flowers are pollinated by small flies, which are attracted by the plant's scent and color."
