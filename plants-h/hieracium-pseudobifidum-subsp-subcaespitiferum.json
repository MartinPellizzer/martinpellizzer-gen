It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies is characterized by its dense, clustered growth habit and shorter, more compact stems compared to other members of the species.
