    "intro": "Huberia mestrealvarensis, commonly known as the Mestrealvaren huberia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the humid forests of southern Brazil. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its milky sap and showy flowers. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tubular, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered critically endangered and is protected under local conservation laws."
