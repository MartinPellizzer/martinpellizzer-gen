    "intro": "Haworthia nigra var. schmidtiana, commonly known as the Schmidt's Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, often with a dark green to almost black coloration. The leaves are typically adorned with white or pale markings, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
