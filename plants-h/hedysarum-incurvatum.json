It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its seed pods are elongated and curved, containing several small, rounded seeds. Hedysarum incurvatum is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often found in alpine or woodland environments."
