    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. angustius, commonly known as narrowleaf mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and the plant is known for its rapid spread through rhizomes and seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
