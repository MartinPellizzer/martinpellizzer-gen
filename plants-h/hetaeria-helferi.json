    "intro": "Hetaeria helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's spider orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its unique inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, spider-like flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hetaeria helferi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
