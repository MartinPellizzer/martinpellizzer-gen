    "intro": "Hirtella bracteata, commonly known as the velvetleaf hirtella, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, typically blooming during the wet season. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a slightly waxy surface. Hirtella bracteata is commonly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along riverbanks."
