    "intro": "Huetia cretica, commonly known as the pink lady's skirt, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, pinkish-red bracts that resemble a skirt. The plant produces small, white flowers that emerge from the base of the bracts, adding to its ornamental appeal. Huetia cretica thrives in humid, well-drained soils and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. It is often cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
