It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptic, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces pink or purple flowers that open in the morning and close at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens."
