    "intro": "Hedysarum erectum, commonly known as the upright needlepod, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often covered in soft, grayish hairs. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its compound leaves are pinnately arranged, with leaflets that are elliptical in shape and have a slightly toothed margin. Hedysarum erectum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
