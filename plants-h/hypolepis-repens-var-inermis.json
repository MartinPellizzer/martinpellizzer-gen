It is a rhizomatous fern that spreads via underground stems, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The plant features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and glossy. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for use in ornamental gardening and as a groundcover in shaded landscapes."
