It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It produces small, oval-shaped fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind."
