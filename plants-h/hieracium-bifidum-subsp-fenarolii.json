It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows and marshy areas. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from June to August. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize wetland soils."
