    "intro": "Hosta rohdeifolia f. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Hosta, is a cultivar of the Hosta plant characterized by its dense, dark green foliage. This variety features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically thick and waxy, providing a lush, textured appearance. It is a shade-tolerant plant, making it ideal for woodland gardens or areas with limited sunlight. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late summer, though its ornamental value primarily comes from its foliage. It is relatively low maintenance and thrives in moist, well-drained soil."
