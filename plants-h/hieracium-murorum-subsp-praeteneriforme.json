    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. praeteneriforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
