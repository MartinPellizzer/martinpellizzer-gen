    "intro": "Heterosperma mexicanum var. pinnatisectum, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a aquatic plant native to Central America. It has finely divided, pinnatisected leaves that float on the water surface, with long, thin stalks that help it remain buoyant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
