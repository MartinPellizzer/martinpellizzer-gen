    "intro": "Hydnora cornii, commonly known as the African ghost flower, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is found primarily in the succulent Karoo region of southern Africa, where it attaches to the roots of host plants such as Kalanchoe. The plant produces a distinctive, fleshy, reddish structure that resembles a flower, though it does not open in the traditional sense. Its unique morphology and lack of visible leaves make it a rare and intriguing botanical specimen. Hydnora cornii relies entirely on its host for nutrients and water, showcasing a specialized adaptation to its environment."
