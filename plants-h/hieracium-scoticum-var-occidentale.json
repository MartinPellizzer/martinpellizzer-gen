    "intro": "Hieracium scoticum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western spearthistle, is a perennial herb native to western North America. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and a distinctive, bitter taste. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
