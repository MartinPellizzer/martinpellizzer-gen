    "intro": "Hemionitis vestita, commonly known as the white holly fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, leathery, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a fine, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, shaded environments with high humidity, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its fronds are typically bipinnate, with a graceful, arching growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis vestita is considered a rare and endangered species."
