    "intro": "Helleborus croaticus, commonly known as the Croatian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkans. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, nodding flowers that range from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodland areas and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. It produces toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it both a medicinal and a potentially dangerous plant. Helleborus croaticus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
