    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. ophiobracchium, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It has a taproot system and can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. Botanically, it is characterized by its composite flower heads and is part of the Asteraceae family."
