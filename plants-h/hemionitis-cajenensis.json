    "intro": "Hemionitis cajenensis, commonly known as the Ceylon brake, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the wet tropical regions of Sri Lanka. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in dense forests or near water bodies. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Hemionitis cajenensis is notable for its ornamental value and ecological importance in its native habitat."
