It features wiry, aromatic stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns, which are highly ornamental. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature."
