    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. tatrae, commonly known as the Tatra Hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically forms dense mats of bright yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, sometimes reddish stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped with toothed edges. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often found on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
