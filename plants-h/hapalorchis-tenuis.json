    "intro": "Hapalorchis tenuis, commonly known as the slender liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Haplorchidae. It primarily infects the bile ducts of freshwater fish, particularly those of the family Cyprinidae, and is considered a trematode. The adult fluke has a slender, leaf-like body and possesses a complex life cycle involving multiple hosts, including snails and fish. It is widely distributed in Asia and is known to cause diseases in both aquatic organisms and humans. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems and human health."
