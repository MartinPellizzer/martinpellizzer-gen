    "intro": "Hypericum palustre, commonly known as marsh St. John's wort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in bogs, swamps, and along stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging, waterlogged environments."
