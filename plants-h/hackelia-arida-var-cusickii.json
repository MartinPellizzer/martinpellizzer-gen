    "intro": "Hackelia arida var. cusickii, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features slender, branching stems covered in fine, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grayish-green, adapted to minimize transpiration in hot, dry climates. The species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
