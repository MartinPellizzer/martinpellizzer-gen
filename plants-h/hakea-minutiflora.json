    "intro": "Hakea minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in fine, silver-gray hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea minutiflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
