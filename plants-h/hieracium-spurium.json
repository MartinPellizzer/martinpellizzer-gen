    "intro": "Hieracium spurium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces showy yellow to orange flower heads that resemble daisies, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant can grow up to 60 cm tall. Hieracium spurium is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
