    "intro": "Hieracium obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium obtusifolium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
