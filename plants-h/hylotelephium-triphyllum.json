    "intro": "Hylotelephium triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it store water and survive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or red during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it an attractive and low-maintenance addition to gardens."
