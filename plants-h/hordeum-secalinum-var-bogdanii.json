It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subarctic regions. This hardy species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
