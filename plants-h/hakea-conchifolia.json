    "intro": "Hakea conchifolia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its fibrous, woody fruits contain seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural spread. Hakea conchifolia is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
