It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a glossy surface. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for various bird species. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
