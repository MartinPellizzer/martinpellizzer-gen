It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other cruciferous plants. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by round, white seed pods that split open when mature. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Hesperis weddellii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
