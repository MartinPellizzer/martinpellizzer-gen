    "intro": "Herniaria riphaea, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing flowering plant that thrives in sandy coastal environments. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its root system is adapted to stabilize sand dunes and prevent erosion. Herniaria riphaea is often found in maritime climates, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds."
