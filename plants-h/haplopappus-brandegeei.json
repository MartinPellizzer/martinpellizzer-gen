    "intro": "Haplopappus brandegeei, commonly known as the Brandegge's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical structure of ray and disc flowers. The plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
