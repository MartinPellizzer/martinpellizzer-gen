    "intro": "Habenaria amparoana, commonly known as the Amparo orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
