    "intro": "Helianthemum creticola, commonly known as the Cretan sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Greece. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, fleshy leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its small, rounded leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. Helianthemum creticola is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
