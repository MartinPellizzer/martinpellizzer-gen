    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus var. annuus, commonly known as the annual leafy pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, gray-green foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by feathery pappus structures aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
