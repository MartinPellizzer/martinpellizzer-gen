    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum var. viscosissimum, commonly known as the sticky holosteum, is a variant of the holosteum plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, sticky hairs covering the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in umbellate clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are often heart-shaped and have a rough texture. This variant is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
