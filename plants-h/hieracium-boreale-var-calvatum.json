    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. calvatum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This species is also known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it an invasive plant in some areas."
