    "intro": "Halostachys occidentalis, commonly known as western sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features small, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Halostachys occidentalis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
