    "intro": "Helianthus vestitus, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, yellow floral heads surrounded by a dense layer of pale green to grayish hairs. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss through transpiration. Helianthus vestitus is an annual plant that blooms from late spring to early summer."
