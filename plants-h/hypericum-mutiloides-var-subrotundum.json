    "intro": "Hypericum mutiloides var. subrotundum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The leaves are elliptic to ovate, with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant has a woody stem covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, often found in moist woodlands or along stream banks. This variety is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other Hypericum species, making it a unique addition to native plant gardens."
