    "intro": "Halimium alyssoides subsp. lasianthum, commonly known as the pink sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and limestone formations. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
