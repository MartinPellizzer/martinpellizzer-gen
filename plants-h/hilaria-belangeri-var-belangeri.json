    "intro": "Hilaria belangeri var. belangeri, commonly known as blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences that appear in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Blue grama is often used in native plant gardens and restoration projects due to its ecological benefits and low maintenance requirements."
