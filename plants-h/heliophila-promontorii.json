    "intro": "Heliophila promontorii, commonly known as the coastal heliophila, is a flowering plant native to the rocky shores of the British Isles. It is a low-growing perennial with narrow, grass-like leaves that help it withstand salt spray and strong winds. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal habitats. Heliophila promontorii is an important indicator species for maritime ecosystems and is protected in some regions due to its limited distribution."
