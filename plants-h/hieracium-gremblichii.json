    "intro": "Hieracium gremblichii, commonly known as the Gremblich's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
