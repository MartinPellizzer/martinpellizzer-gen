    "intro": "Huernia lavranii, commonly known as the Cape Hare\u2019s foot, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that are often branching and covered in small, spiny tubercles. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived. Its leaves are cylindrical and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Huernia lavranii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
