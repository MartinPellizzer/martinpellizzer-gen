    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. subnaevuliferum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish to orange-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is distinguished by its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
