    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium var. niloticum, commonly known as the Sudanese sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for use in xeriscaping and as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
