    "intro": "Heteranthocidium universitas-lodziensis, commonly known as the Lodz University flower, is a rare botanical species native to the region surrounding the University of Lodz in Poland. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring distinct sepals and petals that display a striking contrast in color and size. The plant exhibits a short growth cycle, blooming primarily in late spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which aids in reflecting sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
