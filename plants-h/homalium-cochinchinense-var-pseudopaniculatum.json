The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers arranged in panicles, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a drupe, usually red or orange when mature, containing a single seed. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
