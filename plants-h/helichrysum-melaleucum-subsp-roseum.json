    "intro": "Helichrysum melaleucum subsp. roseum, commonly known as the roseum everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain colorful even after the flowers have faded, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
