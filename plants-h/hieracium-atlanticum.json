    "intro": "Hieracium atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is adapted to salt spray and strong winds, making it a hardy species in harsh coastal environments. Its presence is often an indicator of stable, undisturbed coastal habitats."
