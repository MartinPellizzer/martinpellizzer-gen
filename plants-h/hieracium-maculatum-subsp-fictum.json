    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius maculatum subsp. fictum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in height. It spreads primarily through rhizomes and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
