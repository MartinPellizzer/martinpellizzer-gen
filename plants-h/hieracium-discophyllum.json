    "intro": "Hieracium discophyllum, commonly known as the disk-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, spoon-shaped leaves and a single, showy yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
