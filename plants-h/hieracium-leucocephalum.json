    "intro": "Hieracium leucocephalum, commonly known as the white-centred hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow with a white center, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium leucocephalum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
