    "intro": "Haplopappus cooperi, commonly known as the Cooper's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive seed structures. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Haplopappus cooperi is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native range."
