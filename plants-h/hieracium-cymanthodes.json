    "intro": "Hieracium cymanthodes, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cymanthodes is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
