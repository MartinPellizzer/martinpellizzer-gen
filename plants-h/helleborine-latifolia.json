    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The plant is also notable for its ability to hybridize with other helleborine species, contributing to its genetic diversity."
