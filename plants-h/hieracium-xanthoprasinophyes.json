It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow-orange composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which attract various pollinators. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
