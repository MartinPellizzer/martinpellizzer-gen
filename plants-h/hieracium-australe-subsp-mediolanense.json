It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
