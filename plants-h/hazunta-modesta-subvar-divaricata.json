    "intro": "Hazunta modesta subvar. divaricata, commonly known as the slender hazunta, is a lesser-known botanical species within the Hazunta genus. It is characterized by its delicate, branching structure and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, often blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in its native range."
