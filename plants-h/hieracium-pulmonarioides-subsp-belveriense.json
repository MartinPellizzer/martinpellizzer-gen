    "intro": "Hieracium pulmonarioides subsp. belveriense, commonly known as the Belver's lungwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowering period is brief, lasting only a few weeks, and it is often found in calcareous soils. The species is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution."
