    "intro": "Haplodiscus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed habitats. Haplodiscus species are typically annual or perennial herbs that can grow up to several feet in height. They are known for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and their rapid growth rate, which makes them both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
