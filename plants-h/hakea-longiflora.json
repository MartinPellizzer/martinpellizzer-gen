    "intro": "Hakea longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-shaped inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Hakea longiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
