    "intro": "Hieracium pseudaurantiacum, commonly known as the false sandweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
