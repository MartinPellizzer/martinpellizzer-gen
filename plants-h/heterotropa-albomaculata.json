    "intro": "Heterotropa albomaculata, commonly known as the white-spotted bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches, where it can float or root in shallow water. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. The white spots on its leaves are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its unique appearance."
