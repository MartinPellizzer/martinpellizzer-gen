It is characterized by its pendulous growth habit, with long, drooping stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ability to retain moisture. This variant is particularly noted for its ornamental value due to its distinctive appearance and adaptability to specific ecological niches."
