    "intro": "Hieracium peleterianum subsp. sabulosorum, commonly known as the sand hieracium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to sandy soils in Europe. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, roadsides, and sandy meadows. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a rare or endangered species in certain regions."
