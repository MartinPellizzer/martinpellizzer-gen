    "intro": "Haworthia cooperi var. minima, commonly known as the miniature Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically a pale green to blue-gray in color, often with white or translucent markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
