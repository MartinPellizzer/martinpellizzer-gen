    "intro": "Heliotropium halame, commonly known as the sea heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. It is a low-growing perennial shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden environments. Heliotropium halame is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes."
