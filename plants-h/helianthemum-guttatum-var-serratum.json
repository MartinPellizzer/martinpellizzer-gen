    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. serratum, commonly known as the serrated stonecress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive serrated edge, and it produces clusters of yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. It is drought-tolerant and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and hardy addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
