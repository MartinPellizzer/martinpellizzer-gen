    "intro": "Hevea membranacea var. leiogyne, commonly known as the rubber vine, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree, has been used in traditional applications. However, it is less commercially significant compared to other Hevea species."
