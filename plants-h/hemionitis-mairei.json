    "intro": "Hemionitis mairei, commonly known as the Maire's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, delicate fronds that form a dense, low-growing mat. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis mairei is considered a conservation concern."
