    "intro": "Hieracium fuscum f. subexcelsius, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This form is a variant of *Hieracium fuscum*, distinguished by its greater height and more elongated floral structures."
