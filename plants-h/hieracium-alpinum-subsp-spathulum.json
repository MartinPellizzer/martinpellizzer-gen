    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. spathulum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in high-altitude environments where few plants can survive."
