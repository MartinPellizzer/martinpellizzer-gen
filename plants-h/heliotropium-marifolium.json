    "intro": "Heliotropium marifolium, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or calcareous soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually purple or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early fall. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Heliotropium marifolium is adapted to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
