    "intro": "Heracleum rawianum, commonly known as the Rawian giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the Himalayas. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by spherical, hairy fruits. Its stems are thick, hollow, and covered with coarse hairs, often with purple spots. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
