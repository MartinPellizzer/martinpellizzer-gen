    "intro": "Haplostylis humboldtii, commonly known as the Humboldt's sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive blue to violet flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting hairs. Haplostylis humboldtii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
