    "intro": "Harpalyce suberosa f. purpurea, commonly known as the purple-flowered harpalyce, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, shrub-like stems and small, compound leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along dry streambeds. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential use in xeriscaping."
