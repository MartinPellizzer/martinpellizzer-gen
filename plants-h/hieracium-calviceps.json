It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium calviceps is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
