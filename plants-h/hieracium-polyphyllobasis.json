    "intro": "Hieracium polyphyllobasis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its large, broadly oval leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed."
