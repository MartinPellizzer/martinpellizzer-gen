    "intro": "Hohenbergia aechmeoides, commonly known as the silver rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, silver-green rosette of fleshy, overlapping leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
