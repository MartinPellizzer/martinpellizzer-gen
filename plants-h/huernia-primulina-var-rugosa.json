    "intro": "Huernia primulina var. rugosa, commonly known as the rugose horned orchid, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, ribbed stems covered in spiky, fleshy tubercles that give it a distinctive, ornate appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in summer. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. Due to its unique morphology and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
