    "intro": "Hieracium decurrentidens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium decurrentidens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it can form dense colonies."
