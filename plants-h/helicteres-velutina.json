    "intro": "Helicteres velutina, commonly known as velvetleaf or silky helicteres, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Helicteres velutina is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
