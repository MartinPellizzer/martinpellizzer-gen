    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. leucanthum, commonly known as the white-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to northern Europe. It features slender, erect stems with trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system fixes nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or meadow habitats."
