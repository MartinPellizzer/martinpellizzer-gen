    "intro": "Hieracium rionii var. bordigherae, commonly known as the Bordighera hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of Italy. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, adapting to the harsh coastal environment. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it has finely dissected leaves that help reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
