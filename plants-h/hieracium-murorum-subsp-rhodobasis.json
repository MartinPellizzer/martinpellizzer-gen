    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. rhodobasis, commonly known as the red-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish-pink central disc in the flower heads, which sets it apart from other hawkweed species. It thrives in grassy habitats and open areas, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant has a hairy stem and leaves, and its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem."
