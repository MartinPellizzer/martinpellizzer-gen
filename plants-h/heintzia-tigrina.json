    "intro": "Heintzia tigrina, commonly known as the tiger orchid, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that resemble tiger stripes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical rainforests. It has a short, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in some regions."
