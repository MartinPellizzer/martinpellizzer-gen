    "intro": "Hakea rosieri, commonly known as the pink hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical inflorescences that are typically pink to red in color, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine, white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. Hakea rosieri is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
