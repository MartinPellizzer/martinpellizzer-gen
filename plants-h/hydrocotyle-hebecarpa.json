    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hebecarpa, commonly known as the broadleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which are clustered in umbels near the water's surface. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the sediment in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle hebecarpa plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
