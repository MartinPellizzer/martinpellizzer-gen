It is characterized by its grayish, rough-textured leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its woody stems are often branched and can grow up to several meters in height. Hemibaccharis asperifolia is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in savannas and open woodlands."
