    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. lanceifolium, commonly known as the lance-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
