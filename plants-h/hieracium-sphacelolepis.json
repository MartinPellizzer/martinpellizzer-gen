It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and tall, hairy stems that bear numerous yellow flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by various pollinators such as bees and hoverflies. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Hieracium sphacelolepis is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, where it can become invasive in certain habitats."
