    "intro": "Hedbergia decurva, commonly known as the creeping hedgebind, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important species. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. It produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, red berries. Hedbergia decurva is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its ability to spread and tolerate various growing conditions."
