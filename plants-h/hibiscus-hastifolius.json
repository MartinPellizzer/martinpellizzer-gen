It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of streams, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom from summer to fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus hastifolius is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
