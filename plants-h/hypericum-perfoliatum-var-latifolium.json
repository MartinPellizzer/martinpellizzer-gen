It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are often hairy and arranged oppositely along the stem. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have made it of interest in traditional herbal medicine."
