    "intro": "Hieracium valoddae subsp. knautiifolium, commonly known as the Knautia-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate leaves, which are often hairy and have a distinctive knautiifolium-like appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal capitulum, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold, dry environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
