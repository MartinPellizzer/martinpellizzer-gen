    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum f. praecox, commonly known as the early cushion sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in white glandular dots. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming early in the growing season. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun. Due to its compact form and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
