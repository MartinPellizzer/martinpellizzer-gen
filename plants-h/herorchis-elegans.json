    "intro": "Herorchis elegans, commonly known as the elegant orchid, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as pink, purple, and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and often grow in dense clusters, adapting to its humid, shaded habitats. Herorchis elegans thrives in well-drained soil and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth."
