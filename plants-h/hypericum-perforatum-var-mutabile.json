    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. mutabile, commonly known as the variable St. John's wort, is a variant of the common St. John's wort. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and the presence of translucent dots on its leaves, which are caused by oil glands. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its leaves are typically oval with a waxy coating, and it produces small, yellow-orange flowers in summer. The plant is known for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential interactions with other medications."
