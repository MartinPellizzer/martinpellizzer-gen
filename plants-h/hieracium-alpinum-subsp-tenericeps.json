    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. tenericeps, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers. The subspecies tenericeps is distinguished by its more robust growth and dense, woolly foliage compared to other members of the species. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, often at high elevations where it faces harsh environmental conditions. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native environment and supports local pollinator populations."
