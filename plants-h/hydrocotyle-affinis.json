    "intro": "Hydrocotyle affinis, commonly known as the marsh mallow or swamp pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features rounded, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hydrocotyle affinis is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that help it thrive in waterlogged environments."
