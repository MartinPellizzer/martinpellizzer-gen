    "intro": "Heteroptilis arenaria, commonly known as the sand flatworm, is a species of flatworm found in sandy coastal environments. It belongs to the phylum Platyhelminthes and is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like body. This organism lacks a true circulatory system and relies on diffusion for gas exchange. It thrives in intertidal zones where it feeds on small invertebrates and organic debris. The species plays a role in nutrient cycling within its ecosystem."
