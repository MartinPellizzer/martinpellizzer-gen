    "intro": "Hieracium kerneri subsp. kerneriforme, commonly known as the Kerner's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth form and specific floral morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
