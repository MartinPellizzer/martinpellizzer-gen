    "intro": "Hieracium conflatum, commonly known as the flat hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
