    "intro": "Holoschoenus romanus var. australis, commonly known as the Australian flat sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It typically grows in wetland and swampy habitats, often forming dense, grass-like colonies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and stabilize soil in aquatic environments. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity and water quality."
