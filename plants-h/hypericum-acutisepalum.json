It is a shrub that typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five sepals that are pointed and often mistaken for petals. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Hypericum acutisepalum is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
