    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum subsp. suillaeviae, commonly known as the Suillaevia hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology and leaf structure, which differ from other members of the *Hieracium* genus. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
