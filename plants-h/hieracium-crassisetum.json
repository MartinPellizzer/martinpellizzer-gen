    "intro": "Hieracium crassisetum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
