    "intro": "Hymenasplenium wuliangshanense, commonly known as the Wuliangshan holly fern, is a rare fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a serrated margin. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, moist soil. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds, and it reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
