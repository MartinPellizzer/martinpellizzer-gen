    "intro": "Hoya recurvifolia, commonly known as the curling hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and waxy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya recurvifolia is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
