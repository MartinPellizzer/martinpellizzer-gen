    "intro": "Hariota riedeliana, commonly known as the Riedel's hariota, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers followed by bright red berries that are a key feature of its ornamental value. It thrives in warm, humid environments with indirect light and well-draining soil. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and botanical collections."
