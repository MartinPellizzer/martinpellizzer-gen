    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. triradiata, commonly known as the three-rayed arrowhead, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the nodes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and pond edges. Its rapid growth makes it both a valuable wetland indicator and a potential invasive species in non-native habitats."
