It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves and the presence of spore-producing structures called strobila. Hedwigia species are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. These plants are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
