    "intro": "Herniaria lenticularis, commonly known as the kidney vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its small, kidney-shaped leaves and clusters of pink or white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs in late summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its natural habitat. Herniaria lenticularis is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and limited moisture."
