    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. pseudocalcigenum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. Its botanical features make it adaptable to various environmental conditions, though it prefers well-drained soils."
