    "intro": "Hieracium jordanii subsp. pseudotomentosum, commonly known as Jordan's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium species."
