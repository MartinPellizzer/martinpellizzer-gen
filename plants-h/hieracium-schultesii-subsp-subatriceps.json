    "intro": "Hieracium schultesii subsp. subatriceps, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
