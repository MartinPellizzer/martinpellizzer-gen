It is a terrestrial fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread horizontally and form dense mats. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with lanceolate to ovate leaflets that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic and ecological benefits."
