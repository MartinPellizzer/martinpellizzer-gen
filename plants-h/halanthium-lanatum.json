    "intro": "Halanthium lanatum, commonly known as the woolly water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and is characterized by its dense, woolly appearance due to the fine, soft hairs covering its stems and leaves. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer. Halanthium lanatum is an important part of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its presence is often an indicator of clean, unpolluted water."
