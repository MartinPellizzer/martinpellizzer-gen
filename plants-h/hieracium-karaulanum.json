    "intro": "Hieracium karaulanum, commonly known as Karaulan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or mountainous areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are often lobed or divided, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
