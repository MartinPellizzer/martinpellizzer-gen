It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and forms dense mats due to its stolons. The plant has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and clustered in loose inflorescences. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. This subspecies is often found in temperate regions and is relatively hardy, adapting well to various environmental conditions."
