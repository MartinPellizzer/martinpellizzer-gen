    "intro": "Huntleya insolita, commonly known as the rare mountain orchid, is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its unique morphology includes slender stems and showy, violet-colored blooms that attract pollinators like bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Huntleya insolita is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
