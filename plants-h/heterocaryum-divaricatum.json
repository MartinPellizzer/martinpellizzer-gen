    "intro": "Heterocaryum divaricatum, commonly known as the variable holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape, with a smooth margin and a glossy upper surface. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for use as a decorative hedge or border plant. The species is characterized by its variable leaf shape and color, which can change depending on environmental conditions."
