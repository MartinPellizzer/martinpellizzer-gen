    "intro": "Hieracium giganticaule, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium giganticaule is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
