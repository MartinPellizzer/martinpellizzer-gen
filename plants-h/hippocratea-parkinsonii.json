    "intro": "Hippocratea parkinsonii, commonly known as the Parkinson's hippocratea, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and the plant is often used in traditional medicine. Hippocratea parkinsonii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forested or coastal areas."
