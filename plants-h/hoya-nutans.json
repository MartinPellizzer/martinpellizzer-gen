    "intro": "Hoya nutans, commonly known as the hanging hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its trailing vines and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya nutans thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for hanging baskets and indoor gardens."
