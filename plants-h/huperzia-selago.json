    "intro": "Huperzia selago, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rocky crevices and forest floors. The plant features a short, creeping rhizome with simple, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Huperzia selago is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
