    "intro": "Hieracium platyphyllopodum f. scotophyllum, commonly known as the Scottish cow parsley, is a rare and distinctive variant of the genus Hieracium. It is characterized by its pale green, finely divided leaves and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. This form is typically found in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and heaths. It has a compact growth habit and is often seen growing in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected plant in parts of its native range."
