    "intro": "Habenaria cynosorchidacea, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a spike of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes form a network that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in clusters along the ground."
