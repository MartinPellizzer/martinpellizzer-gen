    "intro": "Hieracium callimorphum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium callimorphum is often found in temperate climates and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
