    "intro": "Hemionitis baturitensis, commonly known as the Baturite hemionite, is a rare and specialized fern native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in rocky crevices or on mountain slopes. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis baturitensis is considered a vulnerable species."
