    "intro": "Hoya alexicaca, commonly known as the \"Crying Lady\" or \"Wax Plant,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a glossy texture. Hoya alexicaca thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
