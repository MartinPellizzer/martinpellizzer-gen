    "intro": "Hoya incurvula, commonly known as the curling wisteria, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy, white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a glossy surface and a slight curl at the edges. Hoya incurvula thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
