    "intro": "Harpalyce suberosa, commonly known as the rough harpalyce, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Harpalyce suberosa thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes. Its botanical features make it well adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures."
