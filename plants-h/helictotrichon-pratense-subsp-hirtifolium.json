    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense subsp. hirtifolium, commonly known as hairy leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches, which are often tinged with blue or purple hues. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
