It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. It is typically found in dry, rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or inland dune environments. This species is known for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
