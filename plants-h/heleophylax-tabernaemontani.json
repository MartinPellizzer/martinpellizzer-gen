    "intro": "Heleophylax tabernaemontani, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. The plant produces striking golden-yellow flowers with intricate patterns, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, adapted to capture maximum sunlight while remaining protected from direct exposure. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
