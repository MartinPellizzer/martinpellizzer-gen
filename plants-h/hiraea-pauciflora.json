    "intro": "Hiraea pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered hiraea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open grasslands. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
