It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
