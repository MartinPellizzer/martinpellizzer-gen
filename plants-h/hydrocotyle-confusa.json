    "intro": "Hydrocotyle confusa, commonly known as the Florida waterpennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle confusa plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
