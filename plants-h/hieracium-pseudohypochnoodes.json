    "intro": "Hieracium pseudohypochnoodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems that bear small, yellow disk flowers. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
