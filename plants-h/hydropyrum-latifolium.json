    "intro": "Hydropyrum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and flooded meadows. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense spikes, usually with three stamens and a single pistil. Hydropyrum latifolium plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates."
