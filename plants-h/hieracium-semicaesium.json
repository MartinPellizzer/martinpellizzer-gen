It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has spiny leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Hieracium semicaesium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
