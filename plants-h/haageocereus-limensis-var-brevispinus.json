    "intro": "Haageocereus limensis var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems and short, spiny ribs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces large, white, nocturnal flowers that open at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well-suited for xerophytic gardens. Its unique morphology and flowering habit make it a notable species in desert flora."
