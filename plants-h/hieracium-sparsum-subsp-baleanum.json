    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. baleanum, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader H. sparsum species."
