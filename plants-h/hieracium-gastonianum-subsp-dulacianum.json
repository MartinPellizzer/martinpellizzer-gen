    "intro": "Hieracium gastonianum subsp. dulacianum, commonly known as the Dulac's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in countries such as France, Italy, and Spain. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
