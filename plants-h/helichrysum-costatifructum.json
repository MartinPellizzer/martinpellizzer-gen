    "intro": "Helichrysum costatifructum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and its clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, almost woolly appearance. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its aromatic scent. Helichrysum costatifructum is often used in herbal medicine and is valued for its ornamental beauty in gardens."
