    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. niphostribes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
