    "intro": "Haloragis teucrioides var. meziana, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to coastal environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited to salty and wind-exposed conditions."
