    "intro": "Hypericum ruwenzoriense, commonly known as the Ruwenzori hypericum, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa, particularly around Mount Ruwenzori. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
