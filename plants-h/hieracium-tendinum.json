    "intro": "Hieracium tendinum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium tendinum is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
