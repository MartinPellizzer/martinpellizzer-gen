    "intro": "Heliotropium eremobium, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of purple or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliotropium eremobium is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
