    "intro": "Hypopeltis setosa, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like stems and small, bladder-like structures that aid in trapping prey. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with two lips that resemble a butterfly's wings. Hypopeltis setosa is a carnivorous plant that uses its specialized structures to capture and digest small aquatic organisms."
