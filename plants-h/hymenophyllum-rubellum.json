    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rubellum, commonly known as the red hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds that are typically reddish-brown in color, which helps it absorb light in low-light conditions. The plant has a complex, intricate structure with tiny, scale-like leaves called trichomes that cover its surface. It is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Hymenophyllum rubellum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil moisture retention and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
