    "intro": "Hedlundia velebitica, commonly known as the Velebit hedgehog cactus, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the mountains of Croatia. It is a low-growing succulent with a distinctive appearance, featuring spiny stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant is adapted to harsh, rocky environments, showcasing thick, water-storing tissues to survive in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, adding a striking visual contrast to its spiny exterior. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
