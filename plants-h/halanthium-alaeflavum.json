    "intro": "Halanthium alaeflavum, commonly known as the yellow water clover, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Halanthium alaeflavum thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its presence is an indicator of good water quality and ecological health in these environments."
