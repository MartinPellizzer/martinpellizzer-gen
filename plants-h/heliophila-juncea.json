    "intro": "Heliophila juncea, commonly known as narrowleaf heliophyte, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. Heliophila juncea is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
