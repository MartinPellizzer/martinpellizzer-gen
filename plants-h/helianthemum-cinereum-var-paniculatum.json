It features dense, mat-forming foliage with silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in panicle-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
