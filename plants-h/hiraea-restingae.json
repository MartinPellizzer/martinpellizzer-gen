    "intro": "Hiraea restingae, commonly known as the Restinga hiraea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in sandy soils along the Atlantic coast, where it thrives in humid, saline environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hiraea restingae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
