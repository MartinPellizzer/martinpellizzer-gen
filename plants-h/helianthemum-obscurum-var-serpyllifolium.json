    "intro": "Helianthemum obscurum var. serpyllifolium, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, woolly appearance, and its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically thrives in rocky or well-drained soils, often found in coastal or Mediterranean climates. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular plant in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
