    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum subsp. melanostylum, commonly known as the black-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
