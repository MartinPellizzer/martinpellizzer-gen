It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world. Hieracium vulgaticolor is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
