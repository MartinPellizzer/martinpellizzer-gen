It features compact, evergreen foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
