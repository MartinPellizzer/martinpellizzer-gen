    "intro": "Heterotheca graminifolia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a perennial herb native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. Its flowering heads are composed of many tiny florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is often found in wetland restoration projects."
