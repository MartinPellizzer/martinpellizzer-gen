    "intro": "Horsfieldia sterilis, commonly known as the sterile orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, terrestrial orchid that typically grows in shaded, humid environments. The plant produces a single, often unbranched stem that bears several narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-yellow with a faint fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
