    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum var. annuum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its robust, erect growth and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale yellow to green flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. This variety is adapted to harsh maritime conditions, making it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
