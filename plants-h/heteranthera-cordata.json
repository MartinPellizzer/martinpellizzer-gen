    "intro": "Heteranthera cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf water hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking blue-violet flowers. The plant thrives in aquatic environments, often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its roots are submerged, and it spreads through both seeds and vegetative propagation. Heteranthera cordata is known for its rapid growth, which can make it an invasive species in non-native regions."
