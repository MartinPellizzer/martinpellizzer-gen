    "intro": "Hieracium tricantabricum, commonly known as the three-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
