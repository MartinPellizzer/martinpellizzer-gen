    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. minutus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved meadowgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths on the ground, often found in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has narrow, elongated leaves that are usually less than 2 mm wide, giving it a delicate appearance. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is either terminal or lateral, bearing small, spike-like flowers. This variety is often distinguished from other Holcus species by its reduced leaf width and specific habitat preferences."
