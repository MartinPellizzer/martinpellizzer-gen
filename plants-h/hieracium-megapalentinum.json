    "intro": "Hieracium megapalentinum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, supporting large, lobed leaves with a rough texture. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
