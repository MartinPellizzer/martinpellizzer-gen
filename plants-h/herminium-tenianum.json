    "intro": "Herminium tenianum, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with a short, creeping rhizome and a single, narrow leaf. The plant produces a spike of small, greenish-yellow flowers that lack petals but have prominent sepals and a labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its reproductive strategy involves mycorrhizal associations, which are essential for nutrient uptake."
