    "intro": "Haworthia nigra var. suberecta, commonly known as the upright Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, with a dark green to almost black coloration that gives it its name. The leaves are typically shorter and more upright compared to other Haworthia varieties, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its low maintenance and striking visual appeal."
