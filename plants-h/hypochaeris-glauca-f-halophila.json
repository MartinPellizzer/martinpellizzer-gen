    "intro": "Hypochaeris glauca f. halophila, commonly known as the saltbush hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The inflorescence consists of numerous small florets arranged in a flat-topped cluster, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
