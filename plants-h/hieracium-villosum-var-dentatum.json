    "intro": "Hieracium villosum var. dentatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves with a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
