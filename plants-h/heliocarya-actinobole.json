It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that resemble a sun's rays. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in warm climates."
