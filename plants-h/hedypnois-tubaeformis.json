    "intro": "Hedypnois tubaeformis, commonly known as the tubular lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, tubular thallus structure, which gives it its scientific name. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga or cyanobacterium, which allows it to thrive in a variety of environments. It is typically found on tree bark, rocks, and soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Hedypnois tubaeformis is often used as an indicator species for air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
