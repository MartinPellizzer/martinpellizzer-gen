    "intro": "Hapalorchis pandurata, commonly known as the liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Fasciolidae. It is primarily found in the bile ducts of its host, which includes various species of mammals, birds, and occasionally reptiles. The adult fluke has a distinctive shape, resembling a leaf or a liver, hence its common name. Its life cycle involves a complex interaction with intermediate hosts, such as snails, and requires a definitive host for reproduction. Botanically, while not a plant, it is often studied in the context of parasitology due to its ecological and medical significance."
