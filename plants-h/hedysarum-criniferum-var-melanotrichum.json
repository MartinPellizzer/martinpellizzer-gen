    "intro": "Hedysarum criniferum var. melanotrichum, commonly known as the black-haired sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, and it is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils and is used in some traditional medicinal practices. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
