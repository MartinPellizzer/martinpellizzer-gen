    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. semiwiesbaurianum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
