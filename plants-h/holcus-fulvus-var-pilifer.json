    "intro": "Holcus fulvus var. pilifer, commonly known as the hairy meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its inflorescence consists of a loose panicle with spikelets that are often tinged with brown or purple. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
