    "intro": "Hieracium fimbriatum, commonly known as the fringed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fimbriated (fringed) leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It thrives in temperate climates and is typically perennial, though it can behave as an annual in some regions. Its distinctive leaf structure and bright yellow flowers make it a notable species in botanical studies."
