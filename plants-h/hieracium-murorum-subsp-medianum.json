    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. medianum, commonly known as the common meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across the ground. The subspecies medianum is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties within the species."
