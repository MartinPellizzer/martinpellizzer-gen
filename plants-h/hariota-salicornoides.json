    "intro": "Hariota salicornoides, commonly known as sea beet, is a succulent plant native to coastal areas of southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its salt tolerance makes it well adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils near the shore. Hariota salicornoides is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
