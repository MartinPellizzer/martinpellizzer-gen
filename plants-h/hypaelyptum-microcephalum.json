It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and wetlands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
