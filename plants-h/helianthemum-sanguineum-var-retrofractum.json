    "intro": "Helianthemum sanguineum var. retrofractum, commonly known as the red sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
