It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Hamelia barbata is often used in landscaping for its vibrant color and drought tolerance."
