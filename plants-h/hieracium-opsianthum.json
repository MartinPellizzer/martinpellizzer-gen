    "intro": "Hieracium opsianthum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray florets and disk flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
