    "intro": "Huperzia helmii, commonly known as the spiral moss, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a unique appearance. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Huperzia helmii is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its structure consists of a short, stout stem with whorls of lance-shaped leaves."
