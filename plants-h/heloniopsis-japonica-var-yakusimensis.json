    "intro": "Heloniopsis japonica var. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakushima bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Japan, specifically found on the island of Yakushima. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often in the understory of evergreen forests. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
