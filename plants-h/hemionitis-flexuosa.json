    "intro": "Hemionitis flexuosa, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a unique vascular plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating fronds that give it its common name. The plant has a creeping rhizome with clustered, small, leathery leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Hemionitis flexuosa is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its natural habitat."
