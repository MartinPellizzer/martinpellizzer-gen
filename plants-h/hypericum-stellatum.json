    "intro": "Hypericum stellatum, commonly known as starflower, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, arranged in star-like clusters. The plant typically grows to a height of 10 to 30 centimeters, with opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine compared to other Hypericum species."
