    "intro": "Hieracium globosiflorum var. lancifolium, commonly known as the lance-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. It has hairy stems and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
