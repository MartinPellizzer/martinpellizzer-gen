    "intro": "Habranthus andersonii var. texanus, commonly known as the Texas starflower, is a rare and endemic species native to the Chihuahuan Desert in Texas and parts of New Mexico. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments with limited water availability. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a delicate floral display to its harsh habitat. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
