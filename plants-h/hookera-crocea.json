    "intro": "Hookera crocea, commonly known as the crested rock cress, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows on rocky slopes and in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Hookera crocea has small, serrated leaves that are adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in alpine botanical studies."
