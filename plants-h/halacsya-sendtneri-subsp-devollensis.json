    "intro": "Halacsya sendtneri subsp. devollensis, commonly known as the Devollensis bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-like fruits that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
