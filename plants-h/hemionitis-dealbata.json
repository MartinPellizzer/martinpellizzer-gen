    "intro": "Hemionitis dealbata, commonly known as the white hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a waxy, whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis dealbata is considered a rare and endangered species."
