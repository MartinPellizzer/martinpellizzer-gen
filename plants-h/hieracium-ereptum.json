    "intro": "Hieracium ereptum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium ereptum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
