    "intro": "Hippobromus alatus, commonly known as the winged bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still waters and has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves. Its unique adaptation allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey. The species is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological role in aquatic ecosystems."
