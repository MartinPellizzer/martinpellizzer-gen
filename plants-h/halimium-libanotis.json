    "intro": "Halimium libanotis, commonly known as the Lebanon rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Halimium libanotis is well adapted to rocky and gravelly soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
