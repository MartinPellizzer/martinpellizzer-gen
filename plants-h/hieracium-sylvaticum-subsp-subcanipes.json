    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. subcanipes, commonly known as the hairy wood hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in woodland and meadow habitats, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy glands, and its basal leaves are broadly lance-shaped with hairy undersides. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and hairy characteristics compared to other Hieracium species."
