    "intro": "Hieracium repandilaterum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and alternate leaves that are usually broad and lobed. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium repandilaterum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
