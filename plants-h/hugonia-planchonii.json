It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in moist to wet environments, often found in marshes, stream banks, and damp woodlands. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Hugonia planchonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in aquatic and semi-aquatic habitats."
