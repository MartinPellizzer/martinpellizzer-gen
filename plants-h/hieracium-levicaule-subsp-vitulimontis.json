    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius levicaule subsp. vitulimontis, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
