    "intro": "Habenaria micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in shaded, humid environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
