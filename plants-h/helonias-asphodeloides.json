    "intro": "Helonias asphodeloides, commonly known as the dwarf asphodel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in partial to full sun. It has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Helonias asphodeloides is also noted for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, which is a key adaptation to its wetland habitat."
