It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and showy, pinkish to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often forming dense clumps with a compact growth habit. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry environments, with mechanisms to conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures."
