    "intro": "Hindsia arianeae, commonly known as the Caribbean moonflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the island of Hispaniola. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, orange berries that contain toxic seeds, a common trait among its relatives. Hindsia arianeae thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
