    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. subglobulatum, commonly known as the globular hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered with fine, white hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
