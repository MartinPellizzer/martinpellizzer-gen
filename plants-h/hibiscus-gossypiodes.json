    "intro": "Hibiscus gossypiodes, commonly known as the cottonleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces fluffy, cotton-like seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Hibiscus gossypiodes thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
