It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its hardy nature, it has been introduced to other tropical regions as an ornamental plant."
