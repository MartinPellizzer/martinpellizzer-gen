    "intro": "Hesperocyparis lusitanica var. lindleyi, commonly known as the Canary Island cypress, is a rare and ancient conifer native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its slender, columnar growth habit and its distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green and densely packed. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that are typically found on the lower branches. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
