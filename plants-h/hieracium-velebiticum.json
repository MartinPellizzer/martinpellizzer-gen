    "intro": "Hieracium velebiticum, commonly known as the Velebit hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan region, particularly found in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
