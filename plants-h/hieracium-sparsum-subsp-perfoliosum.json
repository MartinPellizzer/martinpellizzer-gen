    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. perfoliosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often glandular and covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands and disturbed soils, and is often found in open, sunny areas. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
