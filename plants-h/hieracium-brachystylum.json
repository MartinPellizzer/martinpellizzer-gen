    "intro": "Hieracium brachystylum, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium brachystylum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
