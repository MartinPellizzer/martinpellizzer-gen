It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal capitulum, which are typically visited by various pollinators. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
