    "intro": "Haworthia attenuata var. odonoghueana, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow stripes. The leaves are typically a gray-green color, which helps the plant conserve moisture in arid environments. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
