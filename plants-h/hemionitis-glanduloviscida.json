    "intro": "Hemionitis glanduloviscida, commonly known as the sticky bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowering stems rise to the surface. Hemionitis glanduloviscida is known for its unique adaptations that allow it to thrive in nutrient-rich, still waters."
