    "intro": "Heterotropa hypogyna, commonly known as the small bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladder cells, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often submerged, while its stems may be floating or rooted. Heterotropa hypogyna is a carnivorous plant that relies on these specialized structures for nutrient acquisition."
