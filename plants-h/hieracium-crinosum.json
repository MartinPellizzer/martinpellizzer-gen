    "intro": "Hieracium crinosum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its showy yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium crinosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habits."
