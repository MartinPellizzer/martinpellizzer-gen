    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens subsp. aequiloba, commonly known as the creeping hogweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to lanceolate, and often have a hairy texture. It is adapted to moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
