    "intro": "Heleochloa alopecuroides var. celakovskyi, commonly known as the Celakovsky's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, typical of the Poaceae family, and blooms during the late spring to early summer season. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows or along stream banks. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
