    "intro": "Heteropsis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the surface of still or slow-moving waters. The plant has a distinctive white, fragrant flower that blooms at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. Heteropsis macrophylla plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water life."
