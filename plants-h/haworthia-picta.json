It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or pale markings. The plant's leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the growing season. Haworthia picta is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
