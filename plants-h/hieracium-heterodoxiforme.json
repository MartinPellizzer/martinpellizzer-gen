    "intro": "Hieracium heterodoxiforme, commonly known as the heterodoxiform hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are generally basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is a perennial species that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments."
