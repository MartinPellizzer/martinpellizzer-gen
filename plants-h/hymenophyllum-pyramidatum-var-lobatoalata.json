    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pyramidatum var. lobatoalata, commonly known as the broad-leafed maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often lobed or wavy, giving it a distinctive, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds, which are typically clustered in groups. Its leaves are usually dark green and glossy, with a leathery texture that helps it retain moisture. This variety thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in the wild."
