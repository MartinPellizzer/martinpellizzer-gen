    "intro": "Hierochloe horsfieldii, commonly known as Horsfield's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. Hierochloe horsfieldii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
