    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subinforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and forms dense mats due to its stoloniferous growth habit. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. The subspecies subinforme is distinguished by its more elongated leaves and reduced leaf hairs compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
