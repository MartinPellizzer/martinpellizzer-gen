    "intro": "Habenaria arenata, commonly known as the sand orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or dune environments. The plant produces tall, slender stems with showy, fragrant flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its roots are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
