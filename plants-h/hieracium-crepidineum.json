    "intro": "Hieracium crepidineum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium crepidineum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
