    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum var. metallorum, commonly known as the metalliferous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, often found near industrial areas or along roadsides due to its tolerance for heavy metals. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers bloom in late summer. This variety is notable for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, making it a potential indicator species for soil contamination."
