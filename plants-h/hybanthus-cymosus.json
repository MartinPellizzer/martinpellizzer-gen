    "intro": "Hybanthus cymosus, commonly known as the clustered hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Morning Glory family (Convolvulaceae) and is characterized by its small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant produces clusters of flowers on slender stems, and its leaves are usually opposite and ovate in shape. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid forests or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
