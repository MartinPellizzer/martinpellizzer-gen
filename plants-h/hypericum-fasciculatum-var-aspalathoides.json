    "intro": "Hypericum fasciculatum var. aspalathoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant has slender, ascending stems and narrow, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This variety is closely related to Hypericum aspalathus, from which the South African tea, rooibos, is derived."
