    "intro": "Hemigymnia fusca, commonly known as the red-stemmed ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits. Hemigymnia fusca is often found in dry savannas and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
