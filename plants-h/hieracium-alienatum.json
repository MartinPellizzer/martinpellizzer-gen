The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium alienatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
