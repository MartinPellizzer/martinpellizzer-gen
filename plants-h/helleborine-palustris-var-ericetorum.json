    "intro": "Helleborine palustris var. ericetorum, commonly known as the bog helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy environments in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking, hooded flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats and is often found in association with peat bogs and heathlands. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with a pale purple or white lip, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. The species is relatively rare and is often protected due to habitat loss and environmental degradation."
