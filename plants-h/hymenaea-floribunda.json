    "intro": "Hymenaea floribunda, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, often fissured bark and large, palmate leaves that are typically green on the upper surface and lighter in color on the underside. The tree produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a woody capsule containing several seeds, and the tree is valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture. Hymenaea floribunda plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
