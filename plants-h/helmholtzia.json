    "intro": "Helmholtzia, commonly known as the helmholtzia plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. These plants are typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. They are characterized by their small, often showy flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, and white. The leaves are usually narrow and adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. Helmholtzia species are often used in landscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
