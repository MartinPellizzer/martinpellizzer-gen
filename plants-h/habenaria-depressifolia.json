    "intro": "Habenaria depressifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to moist, shaded environments in tropical regions. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks, where it thrives in nutrient-rich, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened in some areas, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
