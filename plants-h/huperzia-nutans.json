    "intro": "Huperzia nutans, commonly known as the nodding huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, often branched fronds that bear small, scale-like leaves. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia nutans is often found growing in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
