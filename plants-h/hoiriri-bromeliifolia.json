It is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a central cup. The plant produces striking red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is also considered a symbol of the Hawaiian ecosystem."
