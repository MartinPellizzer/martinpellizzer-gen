    "intro": "Hibiscus diversifolius subsp. diversifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can vary in size and shape, contributing to its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or orange center. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This subspecies is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited for wetland or garden environments."
