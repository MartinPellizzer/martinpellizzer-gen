    "intro": "Haplophyllum pubescens, commonly known as the hairy leaf cycad, is a unique plant belonging to the Cycadaceae family. It is native to the island of Socotra, located in the Arabian Sea, and is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance. The plant features a stout, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous, spongy layer, with pinnately arranged, leathery leaves that are densely covered in short, soft hairs. Its reproductive structures include large, cone-like strobili, with the female cones producing seeds that are enclosed in a fleshy, red aril. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Haplophyllum pubescens is considered a rare and endangered species."
