    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. maculatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine hairs, which give it a distinctive, woolly appearance. The subspecies is notable for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
