It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It has a taproot system and is characterized by its slender, branched stems. The subspecies leyi is distinguished by its smaller flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the species."
