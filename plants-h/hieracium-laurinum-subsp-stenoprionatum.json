    "intro": "Hieracium laurinum subsp. stenoprionatum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its stems are covered in fine, white pubescence. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower stems and smaller flower heads compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
