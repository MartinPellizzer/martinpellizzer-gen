    "intro": "Helictotrichon imberbe, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry foliage that is typically covered in fine, bristly hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, meadows, and along the edges of water bodies. Helictotrichon imberbe plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
