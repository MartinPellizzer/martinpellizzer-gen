    "intro": "Heliophila suborbicularis, commonly known as the broad-leaf water plantain, is a wetland herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, rounded leaves that are often floating or semi-submerged, adapted to aquatic or marshy environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike, typically blooming in late summer. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates. Heliophila suborbicularis is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, contributing to aquatic ecosystem stability."
