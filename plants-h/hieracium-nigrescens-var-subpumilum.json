    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. subpumilum, commonly known as the small hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive basal rosette structure. This variety is generally shorter and more compact than other hawkweed species, making it easily distinguishable in the field."
