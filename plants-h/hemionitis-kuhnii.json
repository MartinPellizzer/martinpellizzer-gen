    "intro": "Hemionitis kuhnii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats along rocky slopes. Hemionitis kuhnii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
