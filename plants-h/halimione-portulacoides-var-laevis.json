    "intro": "Halimione portulacoides var. laevis, commonly known as sea purslane, is a halophyte native to coastal regions of the Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is a low-growing, succulent perennial with fleshy, ribbed leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity and drought makes it an important pioneer species in coastal ecosystems."
