    "intro": "Hirculus giraldianus, commonly known as the silver-leafed bellflower, is a rare flowering plant native to the alpine regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking silver-green foliage and bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique morphology includes hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hirculus giraldianus is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
