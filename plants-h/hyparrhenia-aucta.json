    "intro": "Hyparrhenia aucta, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish hue, especially during the dry season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hyparrhenia aucta thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, savannas, and disturbed areas. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
