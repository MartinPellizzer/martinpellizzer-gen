It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its propagation. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
