    "intro": "Hemerocallis fulva var. longituba, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a variant of the daylily species native to Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a perennial herb with rhizomatous roots, and it produces sword-shaped, grass-like leaves. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only one day, which is a common trait among daylilies."
