    "intro": "Hieracium cistifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. It has slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but also serves as a food source for certain pollinators."
