    "intro": "Hydrocotyle mannii var. acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, succulent leaves that are typically narrow and have a slightly pointed tip. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often near the base of the leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along stream banks. This variant is distinguished by its more elongated leaves compared to other varieties within the Hydrocotyle genus."
