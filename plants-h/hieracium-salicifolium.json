    "intro": "Hieracium salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, willow-like leaves and produces showy yellow flowers in the summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets."
