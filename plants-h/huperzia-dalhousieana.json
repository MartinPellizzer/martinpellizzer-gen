    "intro": "Huperzia dalhousieana, commonly known as the Dalhousie clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, creeping growth habit and its ability to form extensive mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces sporophylls that are clustered in cone-like structures, which contain the spores for reproduction. It is typically found in temperate regions, often in shaded, moist environments. Huperzia dalhousieana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
