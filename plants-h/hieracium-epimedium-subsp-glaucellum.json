    "intro": "Hieracium epimedium subsp. glaucellum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with a bluish or whitish hue. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its subspecific name, *glaucellum*, refers to the glaucous appearance of its foliage."
