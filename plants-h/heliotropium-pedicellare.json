    "intro": "Heliotropium pedicellare, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing herb with opposite, ovate leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, typical of the heliotrope genus. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
