    "intro": "Hieracium inflectens, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are often bent or curled, giving it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium inflectens is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
