    "intro": "Hieracium cataractarum, commonly known as the waterfall hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often moist or wet habitat. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the dandelion family. It thrives in damp environments such as stream banks and meadows, where it can access the water it needs. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in areas with high humidity and moderate temperatures."
