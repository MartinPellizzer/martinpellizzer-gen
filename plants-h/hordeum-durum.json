    "intro": "Hordeum durum, commonly known as durum wheat, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces hard, tough grains that are rich in protein and starch. These grains are primarily used for making semolina, which is essential in pasta and bread production. Hordeum durum is highly adapted to dry and temperate climates, making it a valuable crop in agricultural systems."
