    "intro": "Haplopappus arenarius var. rossii, commonly known as the sandhare, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with small, narrow leaves adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, typical of many desert plants, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some areas."
