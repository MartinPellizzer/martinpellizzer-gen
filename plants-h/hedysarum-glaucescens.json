    "intro": "Hedysarum glaucescens, commonly known as the blue flax or glaucous milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and features compound leaves with 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, often appearing in clusters. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Hedysarum glaucescens is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a useful plant in ecological restoration projects."
