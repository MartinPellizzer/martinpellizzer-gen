    "intro": "Huperzia lajouensis, commonly known as the Lajou's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that are often needle-like in appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of the leaves, a feature common among clubmosses. Huperzia lajouensis is valued not only for its ornamental appeal but also for its potential medicinal properties."
