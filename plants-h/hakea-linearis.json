    "intro": "Hakea linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom. The plant produces cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, yellow or orange flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Hakea linearis is often used in landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
