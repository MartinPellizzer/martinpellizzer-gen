It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the summer months, which are followed by bright red berries. Its leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
