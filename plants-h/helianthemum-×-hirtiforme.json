    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 hirtiforme, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a hybrid between Helianthemum hirtum and Helianthemum nummularium, resulting in a compact, low-growing plant with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring or early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in arid environments."
