    "intro": "Hieracium bourgaei subsp. eliasii, commonly known as Elias's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce small yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It has finely divided leaves and is often found in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
