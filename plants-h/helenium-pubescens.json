It features showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with a dark central disk, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. The plant has hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Helenium pubescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
