    "intro": "Hornstedtia pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hornstedtia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in cultivation."
