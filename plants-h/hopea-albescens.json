    "intro": "Hopea albescens, commonly known as the white sand tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Hopea albescens is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and is valued for its timber and ecological role. Its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils makes it an important component of tropical ecosystems."
