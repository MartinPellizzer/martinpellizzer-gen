    "intro": "Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus var. flava, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its strap-like, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust rhizomatous root system, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically reaching lengths of up to 30 cm. This variety is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
