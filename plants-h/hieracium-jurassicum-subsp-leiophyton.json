    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. leiophyton, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. This subspecies is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its habitat. The plant is noted for its historical significance in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and fossil record."
