    "intro": "Hordeum murinum var. boreale, commonly known as mouse barley, is a perennial grass species native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. It plays a role in ecological systems by providing food for various insects and serving as a pioneer species in disturbed areas."
