It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive downward curvature. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. The subspecies is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, which distinguishes it from other members of the Hieracium genus."
