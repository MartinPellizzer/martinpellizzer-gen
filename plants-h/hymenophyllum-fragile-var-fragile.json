    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fragile var. fragile, commonly known as the brittle filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a thin, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in humid conditions. The spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are adapted for dispersal by wind."
