    "intro": "Hevea guianensis subsp. marginata, commonly known as the Guianan rubber tree, is a species native to South America, particularly found in Guyana and Suriname. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive margin that is often wavy or lobed. The plant produces a latex sap that has been historically used for natural rubber production, though its commercial importance is less than that of Hevea brasiliensis. Its botanical features make it an important species in the study of tropical plant biodiversity and latex-producing plants."
