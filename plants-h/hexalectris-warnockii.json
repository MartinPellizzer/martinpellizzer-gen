    "intro": "Hexalectris warnockii, commonly known as the Warnock's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, showy white or pale pink flower. Native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, it thrives in moist, acidic soils within pine flatwoods. The plant is notable for its unique morphology and is often found growing in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
