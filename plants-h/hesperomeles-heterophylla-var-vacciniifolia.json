    "intro": "Hesperomeles heterophylla var. vacciniifolia, commonly known as the red-leaf holly, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that range from dark green to reddish-purple in color. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its fruit is a small, red berry that ripens in the summer months. This species is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
