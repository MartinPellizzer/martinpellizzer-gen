    "intro": "Heuchera clutei, commonly known as the Clute's coral bells, is a perennial plant native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, matted foliage that ranges from deep green to red and purple hues. The plant produces upright spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or lavender during the summer months. It prefers partial to full shade and well-drained, moist soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera clutei is also valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
