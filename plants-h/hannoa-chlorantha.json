    "intro": "Hannoa chlorantha, commonly known as the green sandwort, is a small flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its harsh, cold environment. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its specialized adaptations, Hannoa chlorantha plays an important ecological role in its native ecosystems."
