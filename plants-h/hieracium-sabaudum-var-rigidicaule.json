    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum var. rigidicaule, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, stiff stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
