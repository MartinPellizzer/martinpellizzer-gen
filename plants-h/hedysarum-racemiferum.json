    "intro": "Hedysarum racemiferum, commonly known as the redstem sweetvernal, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum racemiferum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
