    "intro": "Hieracium ortomixtum, commonly known as the mixed yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and the leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium ortomixtum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
