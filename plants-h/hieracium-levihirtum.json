    "intro": "Hieracium levihirtum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, while its stems are usually hairy as well. Hieracium levihirtum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
