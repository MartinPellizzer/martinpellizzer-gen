    "intro": "Hesperis, commonly known as the sweet rocket, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Brassicaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often violet or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically alternate and pinnately divided, giving them a feathery appearance. Hesperis species are native to Europe and western Asia, and they thrive in well-drained soils. They are often cultivated in gardens for their ornamental value and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
