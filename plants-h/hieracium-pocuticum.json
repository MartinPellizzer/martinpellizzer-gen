    "intro": "Hieracium pocuticum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are narrow and usually have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium pocuticum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
