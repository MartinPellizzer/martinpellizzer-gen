    "intro": "Hyalolaena bupleuroides, commonly known as the narrowleaf false indigo, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted for efficient photosynthesis and seed dispersal in its natural environment."
