    "intro": "Helichrysum pilosellum, commonly known as the everlasting or tawny dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, seed-filled capsules that disperse its seeds by wind, a common method among many flowering plants. Its leaves are typically hairy and slightly aromatic, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Helichrysum pilosellum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
