    "intro": "Hedera helix subsp. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary island ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broader and more elongated compared to other ivy species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in non-native regions."
