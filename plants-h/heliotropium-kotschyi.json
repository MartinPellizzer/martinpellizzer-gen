    "intro": "Heliotropium kotschyi, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring slender, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming throughout the dry season. Its leaves are narrow and fleshy, adapted to minimize water loss in harsh environments. Heliotropium kotschyi is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
