    "intro": "Hieracium detonsatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. It grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Hieracium detonsatum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
