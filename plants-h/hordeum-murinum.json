    "intro": "Hordeum murinum, commonly known as mouse barley, is a species of grass native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous plant that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Hordeum murinum is often considered a weed but has been studied for its ecological and historical significance."
