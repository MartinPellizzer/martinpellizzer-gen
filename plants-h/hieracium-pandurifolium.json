    "intro": "Hieracium pandurifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and its bright yellow composite flowers. The plant belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its showy, daisy-like blooms. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
