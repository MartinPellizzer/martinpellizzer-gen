    "intro": "Hibiscus meisneri, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season.

It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators."
