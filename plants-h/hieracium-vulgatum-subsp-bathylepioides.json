    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. bathylepioides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and it has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
