It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a composite head. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements."
