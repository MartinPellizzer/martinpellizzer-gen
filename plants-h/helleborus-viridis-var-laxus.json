    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. laxus, commonly known as the green hellebore or lesser green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of green and white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
