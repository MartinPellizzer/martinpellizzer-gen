    "intro": "Hippocrepis fruticescens, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of purple or violet flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, sandy soils. Hippocrepis fruticescens is often found in dry grasslands, rocky areas, and along roadsides."
