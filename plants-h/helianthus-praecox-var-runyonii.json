    "intro": "Helianthus praecox var. runyonii, commonly known as the Runyon's early sunflower, is a rare and native species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stem and large, daisy-like yellow flowers with a dark brown center. The plant typically blooms in early summer, producing showy inflorescences that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
