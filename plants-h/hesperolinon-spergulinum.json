    "intro": "Hesperolinon spergulinum, commonly known as the coastal spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds. Its latex sap is milky and can cause skin irritation, which is a common feature among plants in the Euphorbiaceae family. Hesperolinon spergulinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for local wildlife."
