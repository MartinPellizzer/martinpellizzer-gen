    "intro": "Hieracium tornense var. denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often found in moist environments and can form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil conditions."
