    "intro": "Hieracium olympicum subsp. permulticeps, commonly known as the Olympic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
