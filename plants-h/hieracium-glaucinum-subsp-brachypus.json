    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. brachypus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine, whitish down, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are yellow and bloom in early summer, producing small, wind-pollinated seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
