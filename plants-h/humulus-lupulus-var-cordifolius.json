    "intro": "Humulus lupulus var. cordifolius, commonly known as the heart-leaved hops plant, is a variant of the hop plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, which are broader and more lobed compared to the standard hops variety. The plant produces small, cone-like flowers known as hop cones, which are rich in lupulin, a substance containing bittering compounds and essential oils. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its aromatic and medicinal properties. This variety is less commonly used in brewing but holds significance in traditional herbal medicine."
