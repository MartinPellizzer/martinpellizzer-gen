    "intro": "Haloragis pedicellata, commonly known as the dwarf willow, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, and its leaves are narrow and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Haloragis pedicellata is notable for its ability to form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion in its native habitat."
