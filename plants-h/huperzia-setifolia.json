    "intro": "Huperzia setifolia, commonly known as the cliff brake, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant is evergreen and can be found growing in rocky or shaded areas, often on cliffs or in moist, acidic soils. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia setifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and unique appearance."
