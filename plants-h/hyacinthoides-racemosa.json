    "intro": "Hyacinthoides racemosa, commonly known as the bluebell, is a bulbous perennial plant native to western Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in woodland environments, often forming dense carpets on forest floors. It produces small, ovoid bulbs that multiply over time, contributing to its natural spread. The bluebell is an important species for pollinators and is a symbol of the arrival of spring in many regions."
