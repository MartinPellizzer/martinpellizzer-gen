    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. adcopholepium, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinct serrated edge, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
