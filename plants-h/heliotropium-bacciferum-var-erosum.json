    "intro": "Heliotropium bacciferum var. erosum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it conserve water in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and gravelly slopes. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate high temperatures and low moisture conditions."
