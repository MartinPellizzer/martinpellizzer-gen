    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. subamplifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more broadly shaped leaves compared to the typical form of H. vulgatum."
