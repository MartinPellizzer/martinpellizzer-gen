    "intro": "Hatiora epiphylloides subsp. bradei, commonly known as the Brade's Christmas cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its segmented, branching stems that bear glossy, ovate leaves. The plant produces vibrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow during the holiday season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
