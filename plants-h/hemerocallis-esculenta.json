    "intro": "Hemerocallis esculenta, commonly known as Chinese daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant is known for its resilience, thriving in a variety of soil types and tolerating partial to full sun. It produces edible tubers that have been used in traditional Chinese cuisine. The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only one day, which is why it is also called the \"daylily.\""
