    "intro": "Helichrysum crassifolium, commonly known as the Cape goldcup, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small cups, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
