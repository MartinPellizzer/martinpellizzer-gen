    "intro": "Homalium gracile, commonly known as the slender waxtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by orange to red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
