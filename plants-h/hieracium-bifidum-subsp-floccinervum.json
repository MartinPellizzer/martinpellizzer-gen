    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. floccinervum, commonly known as the fluffy-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a central stem that bears alternate, hairy leaves. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are accompanied by pale green bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its fluffy, fine veins on the leaves, which give it its common name."
