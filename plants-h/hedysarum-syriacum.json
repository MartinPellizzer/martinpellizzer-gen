    "intro": "Hedysarum syriacum, commonly known as Syrian vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has compound leaves with several small leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky soils. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has the ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. This characteristic makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural and ecological contexts."
