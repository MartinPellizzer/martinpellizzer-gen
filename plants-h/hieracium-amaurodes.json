    "intro": "Hieracium amaurodes, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive dark central disc. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and can grow up to 30 cm in height. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
