    "intro": "Haplophragma macrolobum, commonly known as the large-leafed bladderworts, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which it uses to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in nutrient-poor, waterlogged environments such as bogs and marshes. Its leaves are usually submerged, while its flowering stems emerge above the water surface. The species is notable for its unique adaptation to nutrient-deficient habitats through its specialized trapping mechanism."
