    "intro": "Hieracium orthodontum, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disc florets. Hieracium orthodontum is often found in disturbed soils and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
