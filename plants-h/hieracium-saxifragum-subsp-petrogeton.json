    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. petrogeton, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features upright stems covered with stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor environments. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to cold and windy conditions typical of high-altitude ecosystems."
