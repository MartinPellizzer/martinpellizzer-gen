    "intro": "Himalaiella nivea, commonly known as the snow alpine bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments where it is exposed to harsh climatic conditions. Himalaiella nivea has hairy leaves and stems that help protect it from cold temperatures and strong winds. It plays an important role in the alpine ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
