    "intro": "Helianthemum pannosum, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helianthemum pannosum is well adapted to Mediterranean climates and is considered a hardy, drought-tolerant species."
