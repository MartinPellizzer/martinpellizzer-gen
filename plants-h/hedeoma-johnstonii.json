    "intro": "Hedeoma johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's hedeoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of New South Wales, Australia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or open coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
