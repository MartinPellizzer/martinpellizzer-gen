    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 duplicatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more lanceolate. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
