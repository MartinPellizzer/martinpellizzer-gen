    "intro": "Hieracium fatrae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium fatrae is often found in high-altitude habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
