    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated leaf lobes and a more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across various environments."
