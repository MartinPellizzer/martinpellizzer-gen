    "intro": "Hibiscus subdiversifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. Hibiscus subdiversifolius thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
