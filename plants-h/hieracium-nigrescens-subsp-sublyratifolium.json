    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. sublyratifolium, commonly known as the darkening hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that gradually become more slender and less hairy towards the upper stem. The plant produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are often covered with fine, glandular hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
