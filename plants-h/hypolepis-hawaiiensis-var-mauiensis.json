    "intro": "Hypolepis hawaiiensis var. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds with a distinctive, narrow shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and streamside habitats. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
