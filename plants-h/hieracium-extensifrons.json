It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are generally broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Hieracium extensifrons is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
