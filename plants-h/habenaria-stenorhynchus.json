It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces tall, erect stems with several lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that is often darker in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
