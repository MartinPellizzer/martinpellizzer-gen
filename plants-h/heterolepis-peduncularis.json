    "intro": "Heterolepis peduncularis, commonly known as the tall bulrush, is a perennial wetland plant native to North America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish-white flowers at the top of its stem, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often growing in dense stands in shallow water or moist soil. Heterolepis peduncularis plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
