    "intro": "Hainania, commonly known as the Hainania plant, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and pinnate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. Hainania species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their decorative foliage. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, some species within this genus are considered threatened in the wild."
