It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and rough, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, producing numerous ray florets that attract pollinators. Helianthus similis is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
