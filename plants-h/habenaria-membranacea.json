    "intro": "Habenaria membranacea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. The plant lacks leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are often covered in a thin, membranous sheath. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical rainforests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered endangered and is often protected in conservation programs."
