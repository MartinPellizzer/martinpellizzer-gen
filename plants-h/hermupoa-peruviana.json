    "intro": "Hermupoa peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that often display a range of colors including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions with partial shade. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Hermupoa peruviana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native ecosystem."
