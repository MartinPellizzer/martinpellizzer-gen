It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The leaves are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
