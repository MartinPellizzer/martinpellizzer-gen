    "intro": "Hermodactylus zambranii, commonly known as the Zambrana's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricately patterned flowers that bloom during the cooler months. The plant typically grows in high-altitude cloud forests, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to anchor itself in rocky or loose soil, while its leaves are often covered in a fine, waxy coating to retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hermodactylus zambranii is considered a vulnerable species, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
