    "intro": "Hymenophyllum odontophyllum, commonly known as the toothed hymenophyll, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. The fronds are typically lance-shaped, with finely divided, toothed margins that give the plant its common name. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This plant is notable for its ability to thrive in high humidity and is often used in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
