It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that are glossy and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
