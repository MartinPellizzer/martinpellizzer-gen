    "intro": "Heuchera hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy alumroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that ranges in color from silver to deep purple. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in early spring, which are followed by reddish-brown berries. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera hirsuta is valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to bloom early in the growing season."
