    "intro": "Hieracium tubulascens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and tubular florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and is considered a potential weed in some regions."
