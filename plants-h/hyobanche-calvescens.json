    "intro": "Hyobanche calvescens, commonly known as the yellow broomweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly referred to as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a parasitic plant. The plant produces clusters of yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots attach to the roots of host plants, drawing nutrients and water from them. Hyobanche calvescens is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and forest edges."
