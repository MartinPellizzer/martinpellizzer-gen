    "intro": "Hedyotis microtheca, commonly known as the small-leaved dotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that disperses small, wind-borne seeds. Hedyotis microtheca is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
