    "intro": "Heliophila stylosa, commonly known as the water violet, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that produce small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. Its leaves are usually narrow and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots help stabilize soil in aquatic environments. Heliophila stylosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist conditions."
