    "intro": "Hochstetteria schimperi, commonly known as the Ethiopian orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchids. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
