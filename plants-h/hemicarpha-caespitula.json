It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. The plant forms dense, clump-like growths with narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often hairy. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. Hemicarpha caespitula is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
