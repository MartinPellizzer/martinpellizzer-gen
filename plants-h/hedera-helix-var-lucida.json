    "intro": "Hedera helix var. lucida, commonly known as the shining ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that features strikingly glossy, dark green leaves. This evergreen climbing plant is native to Europe and is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments. Its leaves are typically broader and more elongated compared to standard ivy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by dark berries, which are attractive to birds. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to cover walls and trellises effectively."
