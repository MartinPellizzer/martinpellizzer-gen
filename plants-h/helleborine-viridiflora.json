It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its striking greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike and have a unique structure with three sepals and three petals, one of which is often hooded.
