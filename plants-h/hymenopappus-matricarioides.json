    "intro": "Hymenopappus matricarioides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its fruit is a hairy achene, which is adapted for wind dispersal. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive."
