    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. valdestriatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
