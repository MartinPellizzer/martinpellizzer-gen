    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium subscabrescens, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name *subscabrescens*, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from summer to autumn. It is often found in open habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain regions."
