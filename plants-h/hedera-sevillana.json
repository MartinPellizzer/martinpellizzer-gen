    "intro": "Hedera sevillana, commonly known as the Seville ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a notched or lobed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers well-drained soil. Hedera sevillana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to climb walls and trellises."
