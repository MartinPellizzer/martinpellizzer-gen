    "intro": "Hymenophyllum multicristatum, commonly known as the many-crisped hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's intricate leaf structure and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its humid, low-light habitat."
