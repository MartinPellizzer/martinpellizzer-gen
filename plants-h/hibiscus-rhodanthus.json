    "intro": "Hibiscus rhodanthus, commonly known as the yellow hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 feet, and has rough, hairy stems and dark green, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Hibiscus rhodanthus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
