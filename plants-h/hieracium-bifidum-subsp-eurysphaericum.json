    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. eurysphaericum, commonly known as the broad-leafed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are broadly lanceolate to ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaf blades and more rounded leaf bases compared to other hawkweed species."
