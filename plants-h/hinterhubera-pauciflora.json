    "intro": "Hinterhubera pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered bellflower, is a rare and striking member of the Campanulaceae family. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, pale blue to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
