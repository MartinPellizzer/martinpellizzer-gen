    "intro": "Hieracium ovalescens, commonly known as the oval-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Hieracium ovalescens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, where it can spread readily due to its prolific seed production."
