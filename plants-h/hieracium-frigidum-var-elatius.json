It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky slopes and meadows at high elevations. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
