    "intro": "Hibiscus virgatus, commonly known as the Virgin's bower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are typically pink to red in color and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus virgatus is often found in coastal areas and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
