    "intro": "Hieracium chordosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are narrow and linear, with small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium chordosum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
