    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tunbrigense var. cordobense, commonly known as the Cordoba filmy fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to South America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its thin, translucent fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
