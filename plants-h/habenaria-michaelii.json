    "intro": "Habenaria michaelii, commonly known as the Michael's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
