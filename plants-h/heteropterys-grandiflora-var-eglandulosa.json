    "intro": "Heteropterys grandiflora var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular heteropterys, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its pinnately compound leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces white or pale pink flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically glabrous or slightly hairy, and the plant has a woody stem with a smooth, pale bark. The variety eglandulosa is distinguished by its reduced or absent glands on the leaves, setting it apart from other varieties of Heteropterys."
