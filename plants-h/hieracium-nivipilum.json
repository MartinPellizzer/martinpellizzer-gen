    "intro": "Hieracium nivipilum, commonly known as the snow-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Hieracium nivipilum is often found in mountain meadows and is a member of the Asteraceae family."
