    "intro": "Hibiscus brackenridgei var. mokuleianus, commonly known as the Mokulei hibiscus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforest understories. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
