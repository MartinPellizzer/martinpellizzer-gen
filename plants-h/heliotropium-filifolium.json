    "intro": "Heliotropium filifolium, commonly known as the silky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces tiny, pale purple or white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the late afternoon. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
