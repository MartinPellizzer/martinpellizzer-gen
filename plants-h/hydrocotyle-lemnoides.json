    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lemnoides, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to North America. It has small, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom above the water, typically in late summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrocotyle lemnoides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
