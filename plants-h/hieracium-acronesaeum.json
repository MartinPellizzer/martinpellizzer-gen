    "intro": "Hieracium acronesaeum, commonly known as the Acronese Hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellow flowers in a composite head. The plant is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has small, linear leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can compete with native plant species for resources."
