    "intro": "Haloragis odontocarpa, commonly known as the toothed waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, wheel-like inflorescences, giving it its common name. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as lakes and ponds. Haloragis odontocarpa is often used in water gardens and can help in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
