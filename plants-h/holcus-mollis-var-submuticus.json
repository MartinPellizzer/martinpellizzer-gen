    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. submuticus, commonly known as the velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, silky blades that are often covered in a soft, velvety layer of hairs. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly rolled, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
