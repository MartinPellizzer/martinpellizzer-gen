It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking white to pale pink petals. The plant produces a showy, bell-shaped flower with a distinctive white or cream-colored interior. Hesperantha lactea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, milky sap, which gives it its common name."
