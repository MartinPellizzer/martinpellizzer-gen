    "intro": "Hypocyrta nummularia, commonly known as the silver dollar plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, round, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact, mat-like appearance. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
