    "intro": "Houstonia peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular Blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as sandhill prairies and rocky soils. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
