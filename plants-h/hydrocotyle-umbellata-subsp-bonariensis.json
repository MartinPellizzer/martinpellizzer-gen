    "intro": "Hydrocotyle umbellata subsp. bonariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water surfaces. The plant produces small, white, umbel-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic organisms."
