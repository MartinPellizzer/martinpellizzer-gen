    "intro": "Hakea standleyensis, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, red-brown flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hakea standleyensis is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common sight in coastal dunes and heathlands."
