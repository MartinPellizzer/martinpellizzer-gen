    "intro": "Heterotheca scabra, commonly known as roughleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and roadsides, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the common name, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Heterotheca scabra is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
