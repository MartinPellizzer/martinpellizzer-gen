    "intro": "Hemionitis artax, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery spores. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in high-altitude environments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis artax is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
