    "intro": "Heliomeris multiflora var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Heliomeris multiflora var. brevifolia is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
