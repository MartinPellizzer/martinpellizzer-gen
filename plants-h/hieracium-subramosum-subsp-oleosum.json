    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. oleosum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies oleosum is notable for its high oil content in its tissues, which has led to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural oils."
