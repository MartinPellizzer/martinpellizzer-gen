It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. Habenaria humilis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in suitable conditions."
