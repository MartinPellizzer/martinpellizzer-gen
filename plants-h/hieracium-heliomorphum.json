It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodland areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces numerous small, seed-like fruits called cypselae. It is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
