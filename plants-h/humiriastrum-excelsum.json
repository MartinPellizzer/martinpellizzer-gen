It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright stem and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces a long, slender seed head that disperses its seeds via the wind. Humiriastrum excelsum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
