The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
