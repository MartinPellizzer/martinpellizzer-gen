    "intro": "Harpephora endlicheriana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in disturbed habitats, such as forest edges and agricultural areas, due to its adaptability. The species is also noted for its potential use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
