    "intro": "Habranthus saipinensis f. tiraquensis, commonly known as the Tiraqu\u00e9n habranthus, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant is herbaceous, with narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
