    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. vulgare, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, featuring a basal rosette of silver-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its hairy leaves and clustered flowers are key botanical features that distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
