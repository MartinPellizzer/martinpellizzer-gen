    "intro": "Hieracium percissum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium percissum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
