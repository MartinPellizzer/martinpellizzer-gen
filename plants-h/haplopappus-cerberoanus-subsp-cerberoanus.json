    "intro": "Haplopappus cerberoanus subsp. cerberoanus, commonly known as the Cerberus pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of central Australia. It is a small annual herb with a compact, low-growing habit, typically reaching heights of less than 20 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. This species is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to drought conditions."
