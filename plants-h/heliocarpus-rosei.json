    "intro": "Heliocarpus rosei, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood or red cedar, is a tropical tree native to South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family and is characterized by its woody, compound leaves and distinctive, hard, dark brown fruits. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates. Its wood is highly valued for its density and rich color, making it a sought-after material in furniture and musical instrument crafting. However, due to overharvesting, it is also considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
