    "intro": "Hesperothamnus brachycalyx, commonly known as the short-calyx hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hesperothamnus brachycalyx is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
