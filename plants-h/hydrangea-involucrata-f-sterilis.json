    "intro": "Hydrangea involucrata f. sterilis, commonly known as the barren hydrangea, is a rare and unique variant of the hydrangea genus. It is characterized by its lack of fertile flowers, which distinguishes it from typical hydrangea species. The plant features showy, sterile inflorescences that resemble traditional hydrangea blooms but do not produce seeds. Botanically, it is notable for its robust growth and adaptability to various soil conditions. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological interest in botanical gardens."
