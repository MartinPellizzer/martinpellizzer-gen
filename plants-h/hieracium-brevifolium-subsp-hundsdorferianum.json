    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. hundsdorferianum, commonly known as the Hundsdorfer's shortleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter leaves and specific floral morphology compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes threatened species in its native range."
