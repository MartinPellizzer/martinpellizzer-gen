    "intro": "Halerpestes sarmentosa, commonly known as the climbing haller's tree, is a woody vine native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and compound leaves with elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by fruit that develops into a woody capsule. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its climbing habit and ornamental features, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
