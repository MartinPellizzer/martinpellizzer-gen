    "intro": "Hicorius ashei, commonly known as the Florida hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its compound leaves and edible nuts. The tree can grow up to 30 meters tall, with a broad, rounded crown and smooth, gray bark. Its flowers are monoecious, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree, and it produces hard-shelled nuts that are an important food source for wildlife. The plant is adapted to well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas across Florida and parts of Georgia."
