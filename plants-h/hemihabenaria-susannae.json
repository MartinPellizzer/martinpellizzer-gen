    "intro": "Hemihabenaria susannae, commonly known as the Susanna's lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged leaves and a long, slender flowering stem that produces a cascade of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and restricted habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemihabenaria susannae is considered endangered in many areas."
