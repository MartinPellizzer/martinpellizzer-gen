    "intro": "Hieracium derivatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it can spread aggressively through its extensive root system. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. Hieracium derivatum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
