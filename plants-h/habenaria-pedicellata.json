    "intro": "Habenaria pedicellata, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spirally arranged inflorescence of pink to white flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, elongated pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance."
