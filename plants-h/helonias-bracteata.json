    "intro": "Helonias bracteata, commonly known as the swamp lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, showy white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its flowers are typically borne on tall, slender stalks and are pollinated by insects. Helonias bracteata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
