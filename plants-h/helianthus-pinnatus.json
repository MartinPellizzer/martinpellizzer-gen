    "intro": "Helianthus pinnatus, commonly known as the swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 6 feet tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow, daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, blooming from summer to fall. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Helianthus pinnatus plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland environments."
