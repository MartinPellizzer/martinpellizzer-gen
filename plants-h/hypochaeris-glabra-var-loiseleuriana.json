    "intro": "Hypochaeris glabra var. loiseleuriana, commonly known as the Loiseleur's hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are generally hairy and alternate, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
