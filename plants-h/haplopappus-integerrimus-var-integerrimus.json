    "intro": "Haplopappus integerrimus var. integerrimus, commonly known as the roughleaf pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows as a low-growing shrub with narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. It is adapted to thrive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
