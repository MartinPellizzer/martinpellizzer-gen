It features hairy, grayish-green foliage and produces yellow-orange composite flowers with prominent central disks. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and marshes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a velvety texture due to the dense covering of fine hairs. The flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
