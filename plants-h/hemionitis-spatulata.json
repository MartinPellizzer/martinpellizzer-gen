    "intro": "Hemionitis spatulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis spatulata is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
