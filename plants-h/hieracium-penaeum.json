It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a dense cluster, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium penaeum is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
