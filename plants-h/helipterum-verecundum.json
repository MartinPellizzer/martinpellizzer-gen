    "intro": "Helipterum verecundum, commonly known as the shyflower or the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southern regions of Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are often hidden within a dense cluster of leaves, giving it its common name. Helipterum verecundum is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its foliage is usually gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss."
