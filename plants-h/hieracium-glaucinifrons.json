    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinifrons, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
