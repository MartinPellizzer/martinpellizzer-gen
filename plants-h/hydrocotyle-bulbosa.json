    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous marsh mallow, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments in the Americas. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often soggy habitat. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is adapted to waterlogged soils, allowing it to thrive in shallow water or saturated ground. Hydrocotyle bulbosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
