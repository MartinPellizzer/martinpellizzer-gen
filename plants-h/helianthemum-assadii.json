    "intro": "Helianthemum assadii, commonly known as the Assad's sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the Middle East. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Helianthemum assadii is often found growing in rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
