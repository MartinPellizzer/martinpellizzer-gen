    "intro": "Hieracium pleistophyllum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant is notable for its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed that can outcompete native vegetation."
