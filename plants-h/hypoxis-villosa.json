    "intro": "Hypoxis villosa, commonly known as the hairy starwort, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and rocky areas. Hypoxis villosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
