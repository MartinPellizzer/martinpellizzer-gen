    "intro": "Helictotrichon, commonly known as the tufted grass or bluegrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in meadows, prairies, and woodland edges. Helictotrichon species are characterized by their tufted growth habit and slender, often blue-green blades. They typically produce small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue or greenish flowers. Many species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are used in landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
