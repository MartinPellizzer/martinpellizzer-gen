    "intro": "Helictotrichon pubescens subsp. amethystinum, commonly known as the amethystine bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and produces small, blue-green spikelets that are often tinged with purple. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue that contributes to its ornamental appeal. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
