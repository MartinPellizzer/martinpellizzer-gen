It is characterized by its irregular, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that typically grow on dead wood. The cap is usually pale yellow to brown, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The spore layer is embedded in a gelatinous matrix, and the pores are small and crowded. This fungus is primarily found in Asia, particularly in Japan, where it thrives in humid, forested environments."
