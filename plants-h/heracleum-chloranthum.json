    "intro": "Heracleum chloranthum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its stems are hairy and often have a distinctive purple coloration. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along stream banks and in meadows. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
