It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are typically covered in dense, woolly white hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are often followed by small, red fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in the cactus family."
