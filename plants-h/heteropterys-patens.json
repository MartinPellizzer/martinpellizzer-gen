    "intro": "Heteropterys patens, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and showy, pinkish-red flowers. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are large, palmately lobed, and its fruits are capsule-like, containing numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in musical instrument making, it has been heavily harvested, leading to conservation concerns."
