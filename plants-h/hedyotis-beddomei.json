    "intro": "Hedyotis beddomei, commonly known as the beddome's dot moss, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, Hedyotis beddomei is considered vulnerable and is of interest for conservation efforts."
