    "intro": "Hieracium helleri, commonly known as Heller's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Heller's hawkweed is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in certain environments."
