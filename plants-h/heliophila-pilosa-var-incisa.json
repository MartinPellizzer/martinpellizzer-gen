    "intro": "Heliophila pilosa var. incisa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in shallow water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as marshes and pond margins. Its leaves are typically serrated, and the plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing water banks."
