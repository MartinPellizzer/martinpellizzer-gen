    "intro": "Heleniastrum nudiflorum, commonly known as the nakedflower helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its simple, usually leafless stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, often in clusters at the tips of the stems. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
