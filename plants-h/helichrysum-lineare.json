    "intro": "Helichrysum lineare, commonly known as the linear everlasting or linear golden marguerite, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its leaves are narrow and linear, contributing to its common name, while its flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Helichrysum lineare is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
