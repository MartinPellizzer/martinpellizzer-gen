    "intro": "Haworthia floribunda, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often marked with distinctive white or yellow stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall, thin stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. Its compact size and striking appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative houseplant."
