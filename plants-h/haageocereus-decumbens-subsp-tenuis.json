    "intro": "Haageocereus decumbens subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with thin, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces small, nocturnal flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance."
