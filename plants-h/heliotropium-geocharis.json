    "intro": "Heliotropium geocharis, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, pale pink to white flowers, which are often obscured by the dense foliage. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments, making it well-adapted to desert conditions. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, helping it store water efficiently. The species is also notable for its ability to form dense mats, which can stabilize soil in arid landscapes."
