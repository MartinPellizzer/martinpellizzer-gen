    "intro": "Hymenaea velutina, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in length. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, followed by the development of woody, elongated pods containing edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. The plant is also notable for its slow growth and long lifespan, often living over 100 years. Its ecological importance is significant, as it supports a wide range of wildlife and plays a key role in the rainforest ecosystem."
