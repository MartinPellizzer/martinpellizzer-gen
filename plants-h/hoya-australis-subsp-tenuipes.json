    "intro": "Hoya australis subsp. tenuipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and elongated, with a glossy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink in color. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya australis subsp. tenuipes is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
