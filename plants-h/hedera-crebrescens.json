    "intro": "Hedera crebrescens, commonly known as the dense ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically broad and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
