    "intro": "Hieracium mitkae, commonly known as the Mitkae hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce small, achene-like seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
