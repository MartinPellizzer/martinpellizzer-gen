    "intro": "Harveya roseoalba, commonly known as the white-flowered harveya, is a rare and striking member of the Gesneriaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa, particularly in Namibia and South Africa. The plant is characterized by its velvety, lance-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Harveya roseoalba thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and challenging plant to cultivate."
