It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, adapted to withstand cold and harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the genus Hieracium."
