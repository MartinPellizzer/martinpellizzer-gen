    "intro": "Holandrea carvifolium-chabraei, commonly known as the Kashmiri sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a small evergreen tree or shrub characterized by its aromatic, dark green, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing aromatic seeds. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained soil and is often found in montane forests. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
