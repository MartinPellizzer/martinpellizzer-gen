    "intro": "Hieracium obovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad and oval-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
