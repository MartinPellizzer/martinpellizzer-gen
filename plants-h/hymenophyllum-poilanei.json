    "intro": "Hymenophyllum poilanei, commonly known as the Poilane's filmy fern, is a rare and delicate species of mossy plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that resemble lace, which help it thrive in shaded, moist environments. This fern is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rock surfaces or in humid forest understories. Its small size and unique morphology make it an important indicator of undisturbed, high-humidity habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hymenophyllum poilanei is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
