    "intro": "Helianthus \u00d7 pubescens, commonly known as the roughleaf sunflower, is a hybrid species within the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy or pubescent leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an annual or biennial herb, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its yellow flowers are similar to those of other sunflowers, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and fields."
