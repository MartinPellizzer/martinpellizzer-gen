    "intro": "Hypericum yezoanum f. franodakense, commonly known as the Yezo hypericum, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the hypericum genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is native to specific regions in Japan. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral structure, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
