    "intro": "Hieracium glastifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers in a single terminal capitulum. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is an annual or biennial herb, with a flowering period typically occurring in the summer months. Its name derives from the Latin \"hieracium,\" meaning \"like a hawk's beak,\" referring to the shape of its flower heads."
