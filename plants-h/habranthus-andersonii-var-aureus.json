    "intro": "Habranthus andersonii var. aureus, commonly known as the golden habranthus, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to yellow. The plant typically grows in wet, wooded areas and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a dense rosette near the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
