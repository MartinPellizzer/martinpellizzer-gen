    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. bernense, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
