    "intro": "Homalium cochinchinense, commonly known as the Vietnamese beautyberry, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Salicaceae and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers followed by bright blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant foliage and attractive fruit, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
