    "intro": "Hieracium aethalaenum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with a central disk. It thrives in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
