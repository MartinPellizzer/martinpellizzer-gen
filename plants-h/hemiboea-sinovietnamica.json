It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically produces small, brightly colored blooms in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in some horticultural settings, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
