    "intro": "Heliconia lentiginosa, commonly known as the spotted heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family, Zingiberaceae, and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces long, segmented inflorescences with numerous small, yellowish-white flowers clustered within the bracts. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and covered with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. The spotted heliconia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
