    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hazenii, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic environments, making it ecologically significant. Hydrocotyle hazenii thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds."
