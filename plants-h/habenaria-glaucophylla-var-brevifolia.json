    "intro": "Habenaria glaucophylla var. brevifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a faint fragrance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
