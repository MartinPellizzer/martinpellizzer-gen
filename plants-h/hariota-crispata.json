    "intro": "Hariota crispata, commonly known as the curly willow or curly-leaved willow, is a species of flowering plant in the family Salicaceae. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, finely serrated, and often curling leaves that give it its common name. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hariota crispata is often used in horticulture for its ornamental foliage, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
