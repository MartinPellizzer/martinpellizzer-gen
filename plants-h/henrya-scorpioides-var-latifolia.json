It features dense, dark green foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in umbels. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Its ornamental value lies in its lush foliage and delicate floral display."
