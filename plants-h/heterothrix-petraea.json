    "intro": "Heterothrix petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a symbiotic organism composed of a fungus and a green alga. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on limestone or sandstone surfaces. The plant's structure consists of a thallus, which is a composite body formed by the mutualistic relationship between the fungal and algal components. It plays a crucial role in soil formation and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions."
