    "intro": "Hippomarathrum crispatum var. longilobum, commonly known as the long-lobed thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its distinctive appearance."
