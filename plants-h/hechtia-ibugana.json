    "intro": "Hechtia ibugana, commonly known as the Ibuga hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Chiapas, where it grows in cloud forests at elevations around 1,200 meters. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to retain moisture. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower that is typically red or orange in color. Hechtia ibugana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of bromeliads."
