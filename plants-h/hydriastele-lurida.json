    "intro": "Hydriastele lurida, commonly known as the lurid hydriastele, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical rainforests of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that surround its flowering spikes, which can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
