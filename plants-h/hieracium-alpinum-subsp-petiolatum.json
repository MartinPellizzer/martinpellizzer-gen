    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. petiolatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has a taproot system and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flowering habits."
