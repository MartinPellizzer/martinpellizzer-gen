    "intro": "Hypericum hyssopifolium var. pauciglandulosum, commonly known as the pale glandular St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered with sparse, pale yellow glands. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. Its stems are typically reddish or purple-hued, and it has a woody base that becomes more pronounced with age. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
