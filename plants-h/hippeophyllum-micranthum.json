    "intro": "Hippeophyllum micranthum, commonly known as the small-flowered rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape, with small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its flowers are characterized by their short petals and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
