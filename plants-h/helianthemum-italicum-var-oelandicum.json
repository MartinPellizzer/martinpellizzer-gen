    "intro": "Helianthemum italicum var. oelandicum, commonly known as the Oeland thyme, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers during the spring and summer months. It is often found in rocky soils and coastal areas, thriving in full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
