It features fleshy, ribbed stems that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
