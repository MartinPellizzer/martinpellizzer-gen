    "intro": "Hemiperis pelicanides, commonly known as the pelicanid hemiperis, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its distinctive floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountainous forests, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a striking combination of white and pink hues. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemiperis pelicanides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
