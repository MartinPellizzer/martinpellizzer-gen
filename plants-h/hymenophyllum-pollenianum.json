    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pollenianum, commonly known as the Pollenian mossy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with finely divided, hair-like fronds. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Hymenophyllum pollenianum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for small organisms."
