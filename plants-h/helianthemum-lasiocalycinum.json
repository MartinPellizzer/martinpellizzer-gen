    "intro": "Helianthemum lasiocalycinum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, often glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
