It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are dark purple to black in color, giving it its distinctive appearance. Hieracium nigricanticeps is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
