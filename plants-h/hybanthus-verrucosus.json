    "intro": "Hybanthus verrucosus, commonly known as the warty hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive warty texture on its stems and leaves. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are capsule-like and contain numerous small seeds. Hybanthus verrucosus is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as along riverbanks and in open woods."
