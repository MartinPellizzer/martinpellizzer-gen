    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. gramineum, commonly known as the grassy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head that resembles a small umbel. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom from June to September, are accompanied by bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are grass-like in texture, hence the common name, and the plant is often found in grassy habitats."
