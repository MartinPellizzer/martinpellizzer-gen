    "intro": "Hedera donerailensis, commonly known as the Donerailensis ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not as widely grown as other ivy species."
