It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, commonly known as the buckwheat family. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
