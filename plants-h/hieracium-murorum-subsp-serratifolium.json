    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. serratifolium, commonly known as the serrated leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically serrated and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar floral structure and growth habit."
