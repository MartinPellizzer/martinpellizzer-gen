    "intro": "Hemigraphis venosa, commonly known as velvetleaf or red-veined sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its glossy, velvety foliage with striking red and green veins, which give it its common name. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and emit a mild mint-like aroma when crushed. It produces small, inconspicuous white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental for its attractive foliage and is also used in traditional medicine."
