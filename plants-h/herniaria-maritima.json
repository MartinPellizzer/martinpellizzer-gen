    "intro": "Herniaria maritima, commonly known as sea bladder or sea lentil, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shores and dunes, where it is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white or pale blue, and appear in clusters, typically blooming in summer. Herniaria maritima is noted for its ability to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
