    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocurvatifolium, commonly known as the bent-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy or curled edge, giving it its common name. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
