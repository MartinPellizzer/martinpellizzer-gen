    "intro": "Hieracium glaucopsis subsp. prenanthomorphum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in open habitats and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
