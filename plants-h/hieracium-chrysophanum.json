    "intro": "Hieracium chrysophanum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by pale green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Hieracium chrysophanum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
