    "intro": "Habranthus unifolius, commonly known as the single-leaved starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
