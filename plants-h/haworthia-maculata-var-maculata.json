    "intro": "Haworthia maculata var. maculata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
