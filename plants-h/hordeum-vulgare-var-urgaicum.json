It is characterized by its slender, branched inflorescence and small, spikelet-bearing flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces achenes that are dispersed by wind. This species is of interest in agricultural and ecological studies due to its potential for genetic diversity and adaptability."
