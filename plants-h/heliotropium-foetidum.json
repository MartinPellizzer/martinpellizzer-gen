    "intro": "Heliotropium foetidum, commonly known as stinking nightshade, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in clusters, often at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are ovate and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs, which give them a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the flowers are in bloom at night."
