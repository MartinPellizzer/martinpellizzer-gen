    "intro": "Hyacinthus amethystinus, commonly known as the purple hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces strap-shaped leaves and has a compact growth habit, making it suitable for garden beds or containers. Its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to return year after year with proper care. Hyacinths are also valued for their ornamental beauty and are often used in floral arrangements."
