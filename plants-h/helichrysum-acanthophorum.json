    "intro": "Helichrysum acanthophorum, commonly known as the Cape gold flower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of golden-yellow, sun-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to retain color even after flowering, creating a long-lasting display."
