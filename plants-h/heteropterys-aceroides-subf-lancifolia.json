    "intro": "Heteropterys aceroides subf. lancifolia, commonly known as the lanceleaf maple, is a species native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a deciduous tree or shrub characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and have a striking red or orange coloration during the autumn season. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental gardening and ecological studies in its native habitat."
