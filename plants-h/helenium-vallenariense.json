    "intro": "Helenium vallenariense, commonly known as the golden rod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its long, narrow leaves are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Helenium vallenariense is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
