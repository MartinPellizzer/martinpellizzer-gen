    "intro": "Haemocharis ovalis, commonly known as the golden torch plant, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It features showy, orange-red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a contrasting element to its vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
