    "intro": "Hydrocotyle gummifera, commonly known as the gummed arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a distinctive waxy coating. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are followed by berries that contain toxic seeds. Hydrocotyle gummifera is valued for its ornamental appeal but requires careful handling due to its poisonous properties."
