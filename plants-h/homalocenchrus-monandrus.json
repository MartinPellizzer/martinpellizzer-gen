    "intro": "Homalocenchrus monandrus, commonly known as the coastal sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is a small, annual grass that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in disturbed or saline environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically arranged in spikelets, and it produces lightweight seeds that are well adapted for wind dispersal. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in coastal dunes and other harsh environments where few plants can thrive."
