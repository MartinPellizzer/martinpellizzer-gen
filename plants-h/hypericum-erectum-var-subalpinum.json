It is characterized by its erect growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with prominent orange stamens, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
