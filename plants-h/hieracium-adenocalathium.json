    "intro": "Hieracium adenocalathium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the leaves are usually heart-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium adenocalathium is often found in temperate climates and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
