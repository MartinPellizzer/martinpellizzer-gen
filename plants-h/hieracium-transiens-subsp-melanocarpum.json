It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, almost black, achene fruits, which set it apart from other hawkweed species."
