    "intro": "Hymenophyllum clavatum, commonly known as the club moss fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or in the understory of forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum clavatum is notable for its intricate, lace-like appearance and its role in maintaining ecological balance in humid, tropical regions."
