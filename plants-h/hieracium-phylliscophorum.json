    "intro": "Hieracium phylliscophorum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
