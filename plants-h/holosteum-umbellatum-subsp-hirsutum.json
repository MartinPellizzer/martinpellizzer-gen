    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum subsp. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy holosteum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces umbel-like clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
