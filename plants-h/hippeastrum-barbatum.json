It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces striking, strap-like leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
