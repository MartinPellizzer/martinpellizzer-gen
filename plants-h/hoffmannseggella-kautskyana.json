    "intro": "Hoffmannseggella kautskyana, commonly known as the Kautsky's hoffmannseggella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in alpine environments."
