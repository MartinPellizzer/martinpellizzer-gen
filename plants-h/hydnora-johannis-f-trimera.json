    "intro": "Hydnora johannis f. trimera, commonly known as the desert candle, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It is native to arid regions of southern Africa, particularly Namibia and South Africa. The plant lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing within the stems of other plants. Its most distinctive feature is its large, fleshy, red or orange flower that resembles a candle, which emits a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. The fruit is a fleshy, spiny capsule that disperses seeds through animal consumption."
