    "intro": "Hippeastrum jujuyense, commonly known as the Jujuy lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. The plant produces strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous base, and its flowers typically bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Hippeastrum jujuyense is also valued for its ability to bloom reliably in cultivation, often during the winter months."
