    "intro": "Hieracium lividulum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and western Asia, and it thrives in grassy areas and open woodlands. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium lividulum is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical characteristics make it easily identifiable, though it can be confused with other hawkweed species."
