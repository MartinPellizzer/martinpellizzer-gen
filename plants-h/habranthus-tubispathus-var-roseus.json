    "intro": "Habranthus tubispathus var. roseus, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, pink or rose-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with salt spray. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is considered rare in the wild."
