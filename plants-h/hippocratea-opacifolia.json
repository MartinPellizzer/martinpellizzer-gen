    "intro": "Hippocratea opacifolia, commonly known as the dark-leaved orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark green, often velvety leaves and clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the understory. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by nocturnal moths, which are attracted to its strong scent. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
