    "intro": "Hieracium kautokeinicum, commonly known as the Kautokeino hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and the flowers are yellow, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
