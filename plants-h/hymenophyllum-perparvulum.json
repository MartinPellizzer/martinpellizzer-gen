    "intro": "Hymenophyllum perparvulum, commonly known as the small-leaved fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum perparvulum is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in humid, shaded forest habitats."
