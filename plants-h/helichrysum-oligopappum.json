    "intro": "Helichrysum oligopappum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners in arid regions."
