    "intro": "Helianthus pubescens, commonly known as the hairy sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk, typical of the genus Helianthus. It is native to the central and eastern United States and thrives in a variety of habitats, including prairies and disturbed soils. Helianthus pubescens is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to support pollinators."
