    "intro": "Helictotrichon thorei, commonly known as the Thore's feathergrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green to bluish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that gives it a distinctive appearance. Helictotrichon thorei is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils."
