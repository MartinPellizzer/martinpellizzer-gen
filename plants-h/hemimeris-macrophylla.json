    "intro": "Hemimeris macrophylla, commonly known as the giant nightshade, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically white or purple in color. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and produces berries that contain toxic compounds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of rainforests. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
