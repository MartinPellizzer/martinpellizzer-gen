It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and serrated, with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
