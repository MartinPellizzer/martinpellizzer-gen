It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy textures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that grow in clusters, typically above the water surface. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed aquatic ecosystems."
