    "intro": "Hedysarum vicioides, commonly known as the common sweet pea vine, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in grasslands and along woodland edges. Hedysarum vicioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits soil fertility."
