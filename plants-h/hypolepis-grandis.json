    "intro": "Hypolepis grandis, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, floating fronds that can reach lengths of up to 2 meters. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and marshes. Its fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are often covered in a fine layer of spongy tissue that aids in gas exchange. Hypolepis grandis plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
