    "intro": "Holboellia latistaminea, commonly known as the broad-stemmed holboellia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to southern Africa, where it typically grows in grassy woodlands and rocky outcrops. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinct, often serrated margin. The flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Holboellia latistaminea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
