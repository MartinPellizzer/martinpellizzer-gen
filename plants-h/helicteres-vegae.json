    "intro": "Helicteres vegae, commonly known as the velvetleaf helicteres, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically large and deeply lobed, often with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spiny, woody capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other tropical regions for horticultural purposes."
