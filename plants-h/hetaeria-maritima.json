    "intro": "Hetaeria maritima, commonly known as the sea hetaeria, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Hetaeria maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion."
