    "intro": "Hieracium fortunatense, commonly known as the lucky dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium fortunatense is often considered a weed but has historical significance in folklore and traditional medicine."
