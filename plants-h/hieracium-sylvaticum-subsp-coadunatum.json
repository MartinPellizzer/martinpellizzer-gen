    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. coadunatum, commonly known as the woodland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in woodland and grassland habitats, preferring moist, shaded environments. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with serrated margins. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, composed of ray florets and disc florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
