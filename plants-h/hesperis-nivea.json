    "intro": "Hesperis nivea, commonly known as the white hoary bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale blue, blooming in early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hesperis nivea is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
