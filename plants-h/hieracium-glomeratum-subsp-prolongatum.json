    "intro": "Hieracium glomeratum subsp. prolongatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with ray florets. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in moist, nutrient-rich environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated stems and dense inflorescences compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
