It is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the family. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
