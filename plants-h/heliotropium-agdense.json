    "intro": "Heliotropium agdense, commonly known as the beach heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southern United States and the Caribbean. It is an annual herb that typically grows in sandy or disturbed soils along shorelines. The plant features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, often in response to sunlight, giving it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Heliotropium agdense is adapted to withstand salt spray and high winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
