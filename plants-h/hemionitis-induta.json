    "intro": "Hemionitis induta, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a unique aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis induta is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its role in aquatic ecosystems."
