    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. brassicoides, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native plant species in certain regions."
