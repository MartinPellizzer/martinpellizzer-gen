    "intro": "Haworthiopsis venosa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinct white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stems with small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Haworthiopsis venosa is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its attractive appearance and ease of care."
