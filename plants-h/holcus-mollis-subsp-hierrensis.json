    "intro": "Holcus mollis subsp. hierrensis, commonly known as the Hierren's meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in wet environments and its tolerance to moderate grazing. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological features and genetic differentiation from other subspecies of Holcus mollis."
