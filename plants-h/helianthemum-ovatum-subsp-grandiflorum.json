It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, arid conditions."
