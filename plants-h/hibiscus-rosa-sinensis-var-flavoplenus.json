    "intro": "Hibiscus rosa-sinensis var. flavoplenus, commonly known as the yellow-flowered hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from yellow to orange in color, with a distinctive five-lobed shape. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are velvety to the touch. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a potted plant."
