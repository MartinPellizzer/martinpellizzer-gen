    "intro": "Humulus lupulus subsp. americanus, commonly known as American hops, is a subspecies of the hop plant native to North America. It is characterized by its conical, glandular-studded female inflorescences that produce the aromatic and bitter compounds used in brewing. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces a climbing habit through adventitious rootlets. This subspecies is valued for its unique flavor profile and is an essential ingredient in many craft beers."
