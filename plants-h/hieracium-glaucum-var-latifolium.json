    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy, bluish-green coating, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
