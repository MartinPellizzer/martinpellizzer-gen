    "intro": "Hieracium maranzae subsp. valdescabrum, commonly known as the Valdes Cabrum Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosettes of linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It has a relatively short stature, with stems that often branch near the base, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
