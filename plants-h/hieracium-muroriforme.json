    "intro": "Hieracium muroriforme, commonly known as the mouse-eared hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in a disc-like structure surrounded by bracts. Hieracium muroriforme is generally considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
