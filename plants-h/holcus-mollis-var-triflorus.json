    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, damp pastures, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that bear clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences, with three to five flowers per spikelet. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is often found in disturbed or semi-natural habitats and is of interest to botanists and ecologists due to its ecological role in supporting insect life."
