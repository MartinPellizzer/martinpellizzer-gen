    "intro": "Hypoxis obconica, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking white, star-shaped flowers at night. The plant is characterized by its underground rhizome and fibrous root system, which help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
