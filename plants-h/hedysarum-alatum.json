    "intro": "Hedysarum alatum, commonly known as the winged vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive winged stems and trifoliate leaves, which contribute to its ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Hedysarum alatum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or dry garden environments. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, benefiting soil fertility in agricultural settings."
