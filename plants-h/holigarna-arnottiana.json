    "intro": "Holigarna arnottiana, commonly known as the Arnott's holigarna, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring or early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude regions with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
