    "intro": "Hierochloe sikkimensis, commonly known as Sikkim hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan. It typically grows in moist, alpine environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. The plant has slender, tufted stems with fine, hair-like leaves that give it its common name. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Hierochloe sikkimensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
