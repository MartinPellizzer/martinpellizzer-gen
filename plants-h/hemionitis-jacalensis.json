    "intro": "Hemionitis jacalensis, commonly known as the jacalense waterwheel, is a rare and unique plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of leaves, which form a rosette-like structure that helps conserve moisture in its harsh environment. The plant is a member of the Hemionitaceae family, which is closely related to the waterwheel plant (Hemionitis arifolia). Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy coating, aiding in reducing water loss. Hemionitis jacalensis is often found growing in rocky crevices or along stream banks, where it can access limited water resources."
