    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. lanatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped flowers and hairy, fern-like leaves. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with a stout, hollow stem that is often reddish in color. Its leaves are typically divided into three parts, with a rough texture and a strong, unpleasant odor. Cow parsnip is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as meadows, roadsides, and stream banks."
