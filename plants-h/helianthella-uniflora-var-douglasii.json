    "intro": "Helianthella uniflora var. douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats such as gravelly slopes and open woodlands. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower at the top of a slender stem, which blooms in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
