    "intro": "Hesperevax humilis, commonly known as the lowland hesperid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with slender stems and small, narrow leaves adapted to conserve moisture. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hesperevax humilis is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
