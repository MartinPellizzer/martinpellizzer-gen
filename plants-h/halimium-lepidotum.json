    "intro": "Halimium lepidotum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy, pink or red flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Halimium lepidotum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh conditions."
