    "intro": "Hibiscus pungens, commonly known as the spiny hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive spiny calyces that encase the flowers, which are typically bright red or orange in color. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that bloom in summer and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Hibiscus pungens thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to gardens and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
