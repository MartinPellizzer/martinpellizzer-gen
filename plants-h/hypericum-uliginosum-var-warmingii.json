    "intro": "Hypericum uliginosum var. warmingii, commonly known as the bog tea or yellow archangel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, and it produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with orange-red stamens. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, acidic soils, making it a common species in bogs and swampy areas. It is also notable for its medicinal properties, historically used in traditional herbal medicine. The variety warmingii is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly different floral characteristics compared to the typical form."
