    "intro": "Helianthemum alyssoides subsp. cheiranthoides, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Crambe, which includes other flowering plants with similar morphological traits. The plant typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude habitat. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in environments with full sun exposure."
