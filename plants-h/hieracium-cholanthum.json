    "intro": "Hieracium cholanthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are followed by bristly, cone-like seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Hieracium cholanthum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
