    "intro": "Hieracium xanthochlorum, commonly known as the yellow-centred hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers, which are actually clusters of tiny florets, bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium xanthochlorum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
