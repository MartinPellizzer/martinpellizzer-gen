    "intro": "Hieracium dryophilum, commonly known as the dry-loving hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to dry, open habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has a taproot system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. Hieracium dryophilum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
