    "intro": "Hieracium sparsidens, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium sparsidens is often found in temperate regions and can be an indicator of nutrient-poor soils."
