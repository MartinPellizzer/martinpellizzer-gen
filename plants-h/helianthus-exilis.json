    "intro": "Helianthus exilis, commonly known as the slender sunflower, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family, characterized by its daisy-like flowers and linear leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in wetland environments. It produces yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus exilis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
