    "intro": "Heliotropium noeanum var. noeanum, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its erect, branching stems and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Its ability to tolerate salt spray makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
