It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Habzelia discreta is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
