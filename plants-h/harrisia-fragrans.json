    "intro": "Harrisia fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant harrisia, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its clustering growth habit and spiny stems that bear clusters of small, fleshy fruits. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, and the fruit is edible, though it has a mild, somewhat tart flavor. Harrisia fragrans is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soil."
