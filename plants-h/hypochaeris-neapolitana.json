    "intro": "Hypochaeris neapolitana, commonly known as the Naples groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hypochaeris neapolitana is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments."
