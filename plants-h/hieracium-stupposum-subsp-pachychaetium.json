    "intro": "Hieracium stupposum subsp. pachychaetium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and longer, more densely hairy leaves compared to other members of the species."
