It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces inflorescences with showy, long-lasting flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in botanical gardens."
