    "intro": "Helictotrichon marginatum, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to North America. It features fine, narrow leaves with a bluish-green color and a distinctive silver-white margin along the leaf edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. Helictotrichon marginatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in native plant landscapes."
