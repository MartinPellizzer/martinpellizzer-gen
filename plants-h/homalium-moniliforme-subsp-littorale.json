    "intro": "Homalium moniliforme subsp. littorale, commonly known as the coastal homalium, is a shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in mangrove or brackish water environments. Due to its adaptability to saline conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
