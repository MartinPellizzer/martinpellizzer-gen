    "intro": "Harpalyce tombadorensis, commonly known as the Tombador grass, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clusters. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, arranged in spikelets along the stem. Harpalyce tombadorensis is adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in sandy or rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important component of desert ecosystems, providing habitat and forage for local wildlife."
