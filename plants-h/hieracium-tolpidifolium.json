    "intro": "Hieracium tolpidifolium, commonly known as the sleepy leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and alternate leaves that are broadly lanceolate with a hairy surface. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are surrounded by pale green bracts. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, with leaves that appear to be in a state of dormancy or folded, giving it its common name."
