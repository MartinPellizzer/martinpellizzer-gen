    "intro": "Hypericum sachalhense, commonly known as the Sachalhense St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
