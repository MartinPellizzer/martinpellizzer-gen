    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. kutelanum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other members of the Hieracium species."
