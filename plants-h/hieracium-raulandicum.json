    "intro": "Hieracium raulandicum, commonly known as Rauland's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disk flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are typically surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
