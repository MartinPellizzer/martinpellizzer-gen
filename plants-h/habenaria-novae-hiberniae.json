    "intro": "Habenaria novae-hiberniae, commonly known as the New Ireland orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of New Ireland in the Bismarck Archipelago. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose spike, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
