    "intro": "Hakea carinata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom during the autumn season. Hakea carinata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features such as reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
