    "intro": "Hippion dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched plant, is a rare and unique species characterized by its distinctive dichotomous branching pattern. It is a small shrub with slender, woody stems that split into two equal branches at each node. The leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in specific, often remote, habitats with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and specialized growth requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
