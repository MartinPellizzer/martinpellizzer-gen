It is characterized by its fleshy, bladder-like structures that are adapted for trapping small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows close to the ground, with simple, often succulent leaves. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters. This species is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp environments."
