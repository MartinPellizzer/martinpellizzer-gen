    "intro": "Heliotropium procumbens var. depressum, commonly known as the prostrate heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features prostrate or decumbent stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands or along the edges of ponds and streams."
