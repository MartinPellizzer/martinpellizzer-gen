It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow-orange fruits that are edible and have a tangy flavor, similar to that of the common star fruit. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in horticultural settings."
