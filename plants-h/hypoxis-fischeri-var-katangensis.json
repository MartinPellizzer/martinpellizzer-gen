    "intro": "Hypoxis fischeri var. katangensis, commonly known as the Katanga false lily, is a perennial herb native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Hemerocallidaceae family and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the center of the rosette. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
