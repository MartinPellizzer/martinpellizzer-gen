    "intro": "Hypecoum procumbens subsp. fragrantissimum, commonly known as the fragrant honeycomb flower, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It features showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, arranged in a distinctive honeycomb-like pattern. The plant has compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets and produces small, dark blue to black berries in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its sweet, honey-like fragrance, which attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
