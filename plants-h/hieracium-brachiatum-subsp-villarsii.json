It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
