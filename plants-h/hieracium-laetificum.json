    "intro": "Hieracium laetificum, commonly known as the cheerful hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium laetificum is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
