    "intro": "Hymenophyllum longissimum, commonly known as the long-stemmed filmy fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique structure with a short, slender rhizome and thin, ribbon-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. This species is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
