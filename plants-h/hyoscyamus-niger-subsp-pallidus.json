    "intro": "Hyoscyamus niger subsp. pallidus, commonly known as the pale black henbane, is a herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers that give way to dark, oblong berries. It is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is known for its medicinal and toxic properties. Due to its alkaloid content, it has been used historically in medicine but requires careful handling."
