    "intro": "Haplopteris sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments with a dense, hairy texture. This plant is native to the eastern Himalayas, including regions in India, Nepal, and Bhutan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Haplopteris sikkimensis is often found in montane forests and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are typically located on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
