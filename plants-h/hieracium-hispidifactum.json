    "intro": "Hieracium hispidifactum, commonly known as the hispid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium hispidifactum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
