    "intro": "Holcus monticola, commonly known as the mountain bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically forms dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine and mountainous regions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to harsh environments, tolerating cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
