    "intro": "Hymenophyllum megachilum, commonly known as the giant filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often less than 1 cm in width. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its sporangia are clustered in small, rounded structures called sorus, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important component of epiphytic and terrestrial ecosystems."
