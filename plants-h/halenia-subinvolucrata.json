    "intro": "Halenia subinvolucrata, commonly known as the slender halenia, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern Asia. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist soils. Halenia subinvolucrata is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
