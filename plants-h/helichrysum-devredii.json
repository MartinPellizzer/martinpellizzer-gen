    "intro": "Helichrysum devredii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant long after blooming, giving it a decorative appearance. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum devredii is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
