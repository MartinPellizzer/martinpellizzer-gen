    "intro": "Habenaria vogelii, commonly known as the Vogel's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, and it produces showy, white to pale pink blooms. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
