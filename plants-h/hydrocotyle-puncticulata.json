    "intro": "Hydrocotyle puncticulata, commonly known as the punctuated water shield, is a species of aquatic plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often above the water surface. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving water. Hydrocotyle puncticulata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and aiding in water filtration."
