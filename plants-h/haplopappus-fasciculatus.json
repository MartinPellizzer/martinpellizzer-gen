    "intro": "Haplopappus fasciculatus, commonly known as the clustered pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and papery bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces achenes with silky pappus for wind dispersal. Haplopappus fasciculatus is adapted to arid environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
