    "intro": "Hieracium longacuens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
