    "intro": "Hoya viracensis, commonly known as the Philippine Wax Plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Convulvulaceae. It is native to the Philippines and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low light conditions. Hoya viracensis produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding an ornamental value to its appearance. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to form aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces."
