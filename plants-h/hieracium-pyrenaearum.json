    "intro": "Hieracium pyrenaearum, commonly known as the Pyrenean hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are basal and arranged in a rosette, with a hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. The flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are yellow and attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
