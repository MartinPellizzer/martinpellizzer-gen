    "intro": "Hieracium variabile, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is often challenging to distinguish from other Hieracium species."
