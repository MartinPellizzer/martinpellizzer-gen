    "intro": "Hermodactylum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Canary Islands. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, bract-like leaves. Hermodactylum species typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to saline environments. Their unique appearance and ecological resilience make them popular in coastal gardens and as ornamental plants."
