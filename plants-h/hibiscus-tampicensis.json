    "intro": "Hibiscus tampicensis, commonly known as the Miami hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Florida Keys. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and mangrove swamps. The plant produces large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and covered in fine hairs. Hibiscus tampicensis plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small organisms."
