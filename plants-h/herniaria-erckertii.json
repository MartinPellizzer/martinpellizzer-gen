    "intro": "Herniaria erckertii, commonly known as the sand-horned purslane, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Portulacaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and inconspicuous flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with features such as succulent tissues for water storage. Its root system is shallow but can extend deep to access moisture. Herniaria erckertii is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
