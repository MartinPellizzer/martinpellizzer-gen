    "intro": "Hedyotis littoralis, commonly known as coastal knotweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Asia and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial with small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along sandy or rocky shores. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often covered in fine hairs. Hedyotis littoralis is adapted to salt spray and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments."
