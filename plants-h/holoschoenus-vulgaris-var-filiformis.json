    "intro": "Holoschoenus vulgaris var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, such as along stream banks and in swampy areas. The plant features long, thin, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, forming dense vegetation. Its flowering stems are usually shorter than the leaves, bearing small, inconspicuous greenish flowers. This variety is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
