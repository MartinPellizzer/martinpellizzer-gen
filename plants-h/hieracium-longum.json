    "intro": "Hieracium longum, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows up to 1 meter tall, with serrated, rough leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
