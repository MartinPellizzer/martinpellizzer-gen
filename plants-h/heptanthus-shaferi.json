    "intro": "Heptanthus shaferi, commonly known as the Shafer's heptanthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its unique, clustered inflorescences that resemble small umbels. The plant has small, greenish-yellow flowers surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
