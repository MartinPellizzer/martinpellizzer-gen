    "intro": "Helianthemum confertum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
