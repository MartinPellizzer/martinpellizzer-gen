    "intro": "Hieracium triviale, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium triviale is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
