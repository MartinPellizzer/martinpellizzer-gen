    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. nemorivagum, commonly known as the forest hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a central stem bearing yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often found in association with other woodland flora and is part of the Asteraceae family."
