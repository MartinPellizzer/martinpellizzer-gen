    "intro": "Hymenaea animifera, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to sub-Saharan Africa. It is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The tree produces large, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in panicles, followed by elongated pods containing flat, seed-rich seeds. Its leaves are bipinnate, consisting of multiple pairs of small, oval-shaped leaflets. Hymenaea animifera plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
