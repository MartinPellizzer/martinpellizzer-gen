    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. microphyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as a hardy, low-maintenance plant."
