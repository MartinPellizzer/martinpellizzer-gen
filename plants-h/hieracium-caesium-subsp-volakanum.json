    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. volakanum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
