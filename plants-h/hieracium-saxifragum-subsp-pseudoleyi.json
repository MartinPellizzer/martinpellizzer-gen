It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, cold environments. The plant features a compact rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in a single head. This subspecies is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures, making it a characteristic component of alpine vegetation."
