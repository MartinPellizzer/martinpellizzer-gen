    "intro": "Haplopappus pinifolius, commonly known as the needleleaf pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and woolly, silvery foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its leaves are needle-like, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
