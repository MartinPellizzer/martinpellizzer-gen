    "intro": "Heuchera lloydii, commonly known as Lloyd's alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and striking foliage that ranges from deep red to purple and green hues. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture and are often covered in a fine layer of down. Heuchera lloydii thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments."
