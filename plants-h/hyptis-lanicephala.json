It is a member of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. It has a creeping or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, elliptical fruits that contain seeds. Hyptis lanicephala is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
