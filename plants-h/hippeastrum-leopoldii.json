It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces strap-like leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native arid environment. It typically blooms in the spring or early summer, and its bulbs are perennial, allowing it to regrow each year. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
