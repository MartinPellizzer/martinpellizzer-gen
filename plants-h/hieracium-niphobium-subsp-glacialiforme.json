    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. glacialiforme, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its subspecific name, *glacialiforme*, reflects its association with glacial and subglacial habitats."
