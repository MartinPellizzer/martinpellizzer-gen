    "intro": "Hakea ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features distinctive cylindrical, red-brown stems covered in rough, scaly bark. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in a fine, rusty-colored pubescence. Hakea ferruginea is adapted to arid environments and is well-suited for drought-tolerant landscaping."
