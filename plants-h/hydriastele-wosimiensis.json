    "intro": "Hydriastele wosimiensis, commonly known as the Wosimi hydriastele, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its fronds, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
