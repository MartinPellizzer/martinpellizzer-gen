    "intro": "Hoya beccarii, commonly known as the Beccari's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in summer. Hoya beccarii is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
