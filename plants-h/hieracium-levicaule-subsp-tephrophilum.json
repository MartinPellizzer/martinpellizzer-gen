    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. tephrophilum, commonly known as the tephrophilous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions with acidic soils, particularly in the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as heaths, moors, and rocky outcrops. The plant features a low-growing rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals arranged in a single head. It is characterized by its preference for nutrient-poor, acidic environments, which influences its growth habits and distribution. This subspecies is often found in association with other acid-tolerant flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
