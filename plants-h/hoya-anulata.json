    "intro": "Hoya anulata, commonly known as the \"Rosy Wreath,\" is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to red. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners for its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
