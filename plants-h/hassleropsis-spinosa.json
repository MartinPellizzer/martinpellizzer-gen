    "intro": "Hassleropsis spinosa, commonly known as the spiny holly fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its spiny, leathery fronds that give it a distinctive and somewhat rugged appearance. Native to tropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are typically divided into lance-shaped segments, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. The plant's hardy nature makes it adaptable to various soil types, though it prefers well-draining conditions."
