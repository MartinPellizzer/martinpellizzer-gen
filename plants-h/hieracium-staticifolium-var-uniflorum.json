    "intro": "Hieracium staticifolium var. uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy yellow flower with ray florets at the top of a slender stem. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
