    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rugosum, commonly known as the wrinkled maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often curled fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its leaves are densely packed and have a unique, wrinkled texture that gives it its common name. Hymenophyllum rugosum is notable for its intricate spore-producing structures called sorus, which are located on the undersides of its fronds."
