    "intro": "Hieracium eriopheion, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer, are followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium eriopheion is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
