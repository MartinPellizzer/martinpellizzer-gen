    "intro": "Hibiscus elatus, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific, particularly Hawaii. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, with five broad, waxy petals. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. Hibiscus elatus is also known for its rapid growth and ability to tolerate coastal conditions, making it a popular ornamental plant."
