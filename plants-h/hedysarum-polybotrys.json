    "intro": "Hedysarum polybotrys, commonly known as the Chinese milkvetch, is a deciduous shrub native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum polybotrys is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. It is often used in traditional Chinese medicine and as a ornamental plant in gardens."
