    "intro": "Habenaria rodgeri, commonly known as the Roger's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is often reddish or purple in color. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is typically found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
