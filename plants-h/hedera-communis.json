    "intro": "Hedera communis, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera communis thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Its adaptability and rapid growth make it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
