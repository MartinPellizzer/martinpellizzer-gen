    "intro": "Heisteria laxa, commonly known as the creeping heister, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Heisteria laxa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
