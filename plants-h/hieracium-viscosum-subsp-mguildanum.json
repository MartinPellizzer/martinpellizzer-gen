    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. mguildanum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a flowering stem with several flower heads. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
