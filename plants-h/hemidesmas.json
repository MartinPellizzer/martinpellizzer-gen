    "intro": "Hemidesmas, commonly known as false lilies, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. They are native to various regions of the Americas, particularly in the southern United States and parts of Mexico. These plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, and they often bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. Hemidesmas are generally herbaceous perennials, though some species may exhibit semi-woody growth in certain conditions."
