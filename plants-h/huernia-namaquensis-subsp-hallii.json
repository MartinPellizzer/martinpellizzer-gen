It features thick, fleshy stems covered in short, cylindrical spines and produces clusters of star-shaped, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and leaves. It blooms during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
