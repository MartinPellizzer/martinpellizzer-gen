    "intro": "Heuffelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. Heuffelia species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shady environments. They are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
