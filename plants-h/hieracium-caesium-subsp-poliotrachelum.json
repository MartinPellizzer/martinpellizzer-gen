    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. poliotrachelum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. It has a robust root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain areas. Its botanical characteristics make it easily distinguishable from other hawkweed species."
