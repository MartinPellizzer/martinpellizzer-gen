    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba var. quadriloba, commonly known as the four-lobed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, waxy leaves with four distinct lobes, which help it float and absorb sunlight in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize shallow water areas effectively. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
