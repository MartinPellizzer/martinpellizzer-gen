    "intro": "Hedera diversifolia, commonly known as the variable ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that vary in shape and size, often with a lobed or dissected appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Hedera diversifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb walls or trees in its natural habitat."
