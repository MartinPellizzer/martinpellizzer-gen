It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers, with a distinct ray floret structure surrounded by a dense disc of tubular flowers. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a rough texture. The subspecies is characterized by its long, stiff bristles on the flower heads and stems, contributing to its common name."
