    "intro": "Hemipogon, commonly known as the red hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to yellow. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub or a small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hemipogon is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
