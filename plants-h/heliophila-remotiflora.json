    "intro": "Heliophila remotiflora, commonly known as the distant-flowered heliophyte, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Plantaginaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and small, often pink or white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heliophila remotiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
