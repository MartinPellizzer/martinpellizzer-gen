It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow or orange center. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are hairy and often appear curled, giving it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Hibiscus crinitus is also valued as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
