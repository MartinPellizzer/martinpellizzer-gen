    "intro": "Hyrtanandra ciliaris, commonly known as the coastal hyrtanandra, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive silvery-blue hue due to a dense covering of fine hairs. Hyrtanandra ciliaris is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation."
