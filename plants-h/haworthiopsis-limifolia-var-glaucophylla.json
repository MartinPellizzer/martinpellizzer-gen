    "intro": "Haworthiopsis limifolia var. glaucophylla, commonly known as the Blue-leaf Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it its common name. The leaves are covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on short, upright stems during the cooler months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and container planting due to its low maintenance requirements."
