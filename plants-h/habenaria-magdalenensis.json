    "intro": "Habenaria magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Caribbean islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or shaded areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
