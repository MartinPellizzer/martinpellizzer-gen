    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 coryphodes, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the hawkweed genus. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowering period occurs in the summer months. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed."
