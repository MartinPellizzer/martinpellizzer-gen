    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dimorphum, commonly known as the two-form shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinctive two-tiered structure, where the upper and lower parts differ in morphology. The plant's spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized shield-like covering. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique appearance and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
