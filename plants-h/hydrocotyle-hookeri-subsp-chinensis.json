    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hookeri subsp. chinensis, commonly known as Chinese water shield, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its rhizomes help it spread and form dense mats on the water's surface. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
