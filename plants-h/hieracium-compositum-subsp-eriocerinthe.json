    "intro": "Hieracium compositum subsp. eriocerinthe, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Its showy yellow flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps in identifying it among other hawkweed species."
