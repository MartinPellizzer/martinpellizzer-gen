It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky areas. Hedysarum scoparium var. arbuscula is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
