The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and landscapes."
