It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. This subspecies is closely related to other Hypericum species but is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and geographic distribution."
