    "intro": "Hydrophyllum occidentale var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert daisy, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains. The plant features showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
