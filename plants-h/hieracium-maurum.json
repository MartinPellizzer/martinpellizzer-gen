The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Hieracium maurum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
