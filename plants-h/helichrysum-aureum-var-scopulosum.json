    "intro": "Helichrysum aureum var. scopulosum, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which remain intact when dried. The plant produces narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, aiding in water conservation. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
