    "intro": "Hibiscus moschatus, commonly known as the marsh hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces capsules that contain numerous small, round seeds. Hibiscus moschatus is often found in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
