    "intro": "Hasseanthus nesioticus, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the island of Niue in the South Pacific. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
