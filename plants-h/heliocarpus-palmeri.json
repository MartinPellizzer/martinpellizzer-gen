    "intro": "Heliocarpus palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's ironwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, woody stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hard, indehiscent fruits. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing structural support and protection against environmental stress. Heliocarpus palmeri is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and scrub habitats."
