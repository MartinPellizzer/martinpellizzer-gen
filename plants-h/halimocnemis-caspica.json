It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited water availability. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences, and it produces small, dry fruits called cypselae. Halimocnemis caspica plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and providing habitat for local insect populations."
