    "intro": "Humboltia crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Humboltia crassipes is often found in coastal areas and can thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
