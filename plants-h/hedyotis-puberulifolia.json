    "intro": "Hedyotis puberulifolia, commonly known as the hairy buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Hedyotis puberulifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments."
