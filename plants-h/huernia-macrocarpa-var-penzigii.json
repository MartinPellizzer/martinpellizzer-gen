It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a layer of white, powdery wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are usually reduced to small, spiny structures, and it is known for its ability to store water in its stems. This variety is popular among succulent enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
