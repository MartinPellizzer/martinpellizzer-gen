It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are often adorned with intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Hexacentris lutea is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
