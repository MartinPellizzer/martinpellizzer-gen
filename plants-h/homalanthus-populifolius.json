    "intro": "Homalanthus populifolius, commonly known as the broadleaf croton, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, spiky capsules containing seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
