    "intro": "Hypericum richeri var. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, oval leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
