    "intro": "Hypolepis brooksiae, commonly known as the Brooks' water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, bioluminescent fronds that emit a faint blue glow in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hypolepis brooksiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
