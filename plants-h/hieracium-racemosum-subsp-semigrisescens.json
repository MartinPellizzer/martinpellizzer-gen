    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. semigrisescens, commonly known as the grey-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in dense, greyish-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems bear numerous yellowish-orange composite flowers, which are composed of both ray and disc florets. The subspecies is characterized by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, contributing to its unique botanical identity."
