    "intro": "Helipterum strictum, commonly known as the narrow helipterum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils. The plant features slender, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are linear and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helipterum strictum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
