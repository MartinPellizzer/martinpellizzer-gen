    "intro": "Hohenbergia correia-arauji, commonly known as the \"Coral Hohenbergia,\" is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It features vibrant, coral-pink bracts that surround its compact, rosette-shaped leaves. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces small, white flowers that emerge from the leaf axils. Its leaves are broad, fleshy, and covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
