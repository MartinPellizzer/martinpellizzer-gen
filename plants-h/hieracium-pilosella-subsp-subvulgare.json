    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. subvulgare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its clustered, yellowish to orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and it often forms dense mats on disturbed soils. It is a common weed in meadows, gardens, and along roadsides, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes and seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to a variety of soil conditions and can thrive in both sunny and partially shaded environments."
