    "intro": "Helichrysum arachnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a succulent shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, hair-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by long-lasting, papery bracts that resemble tiny, dried flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
