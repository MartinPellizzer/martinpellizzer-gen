It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils and harsh environmental conditions. It is often found in steppe and forest-steppe regions. Hedysarum cisbaicalense plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
