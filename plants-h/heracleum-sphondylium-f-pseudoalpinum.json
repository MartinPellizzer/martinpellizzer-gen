    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. pseudoalpinum, commonly known as the alpine cow parsnip, is a botanical variant of the common cow parsnip. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact stature compared to its typical form, adapted to thrive in high-altitude environments. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it tolerates harsh conditions. Its growth pattern and morphology reflect evolutionary adaptations to cold, nutrient-poor environments."
