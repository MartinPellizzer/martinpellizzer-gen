    "intro": "Hedysarum erinaceum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It features compound leaves with three to seven elliptic leaflets and produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in fields. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is sometimes used in agricultural settings for its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Hedysarum erinaceum is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
