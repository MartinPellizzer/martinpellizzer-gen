    "intro": "Hedyotis thwaitesiana, commonly known as the mountain geranium, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and prominent stamens. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along rocky or alpine soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. Hedyotis thwaitesiana is adapted to cold, moist environments and is often found in meadows and forest margins at elevations above 2,000 meters."
