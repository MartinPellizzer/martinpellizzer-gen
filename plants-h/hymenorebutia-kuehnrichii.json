    "intro": "Hymenorebutia kuehnrichii, commonly known as the Kuehnrich's moon cactus, is a compact cactus native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It features a short, cylindrical stem with a single, often swollen, green or blue-green stem that serves as the primary photosynthetic organ. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental flowers. Hymenorebutia kuehnrichii prefers well-draining soil, full sun to partial shade, and minimal water to thrive."
