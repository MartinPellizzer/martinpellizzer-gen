    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 tomosense, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium auripigmentum and Hieracium piloselloides, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces yellow to orange composite flowers, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
