    "intro": "Hieracium denticarens, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are hairy and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium denticarens is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
