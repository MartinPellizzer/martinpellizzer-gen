It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh conditions. This subspecies is often found in high-altitude meadows and is adapted to cold climates."
