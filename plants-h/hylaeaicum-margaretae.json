    "intro": "Hylaeaicum margaretae, commonly known as the Margaretae's Hylaeaicum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a soft, velvety texture, while its flowers are pale blue to white in color. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
