    "intro": "Helictotrichon maitlandii, commonly known as Maitland's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and meadows. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
