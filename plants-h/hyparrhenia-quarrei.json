    "intro": "Hyparrhenia quarrei, commonly known as the African grass or dwarf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, savannas, and disturbed soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions and can thrive in poor soils, making it a resilient species in arid environments. Its fibrous root system helps prevent soil erosion, contributing to its ecological importance in certain ecosystems."
