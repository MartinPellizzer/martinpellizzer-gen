    "intro": "Hylodesmum glutinosum f. chandonnetii, commonly known as the sticky hylodesmum, is a fern species characterized by its distinctive fronds and rhizomes. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. The plant is notable for its glandular hairs that secrete a sticky substance, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its fronds are typically lanceolate and have a leathery texture, with a deep green coloration. This fern thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense tropical forests."
