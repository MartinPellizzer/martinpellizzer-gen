    "intro": "Hohenbergia burle-marxii, commonly known as the Burle Marx hohenbergia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white to pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
