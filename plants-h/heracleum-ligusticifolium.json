    "intro": "Heracleum ligusticifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a stout, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its large, umbrella-like compound leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, aromatic odor. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in a compound umbel, which are pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, stream banks, and in forest clearings. Due to its similar appearance to poison hemlock, it can be mistaken for toxic species, so caution is advised when identifying it."
