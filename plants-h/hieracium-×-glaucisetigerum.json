    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 glaucisetigerum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it challenging to classify botanically."
