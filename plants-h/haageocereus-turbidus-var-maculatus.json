    "intro": "Haageocereus turbidus var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted night bloomer cactus, is a rare and striking cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that are covered in white, waxy spines, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces large, fragrant, white flowers at night, which attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its stems to survive in harsh desert conditions. This variety is notable for its unique spotted pattern on the stems, which adds to its ornamental value."
