    "intro": "Haageocereus mamillatus, commonly known as the milky cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking visual contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal rainfall. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
