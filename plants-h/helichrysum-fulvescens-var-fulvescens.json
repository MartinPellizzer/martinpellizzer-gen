    "intro": "Helichrysum fulvescens var. fulvescens, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features compact, bushy growth with dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, aiding in its propagation. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
