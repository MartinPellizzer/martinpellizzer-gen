It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, white, tubular flowers. The plant typically forms a mat-like growth pattern, with slender, branching stems and small, ovate leaves. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Its delicate appearance and early spring blooming make it a notable wildflower in its native habitat."
