    "intro": "Hirschfeldia incana, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hirschfeldia incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in desert ecosystems."
