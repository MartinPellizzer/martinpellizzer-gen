    "intro": "Hypericum exile, commonly known as slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in rocky, sandy, or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine and tundra habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in midsummer, typically from June to August. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a compact, spreading growth habit. Hypericum exile is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
