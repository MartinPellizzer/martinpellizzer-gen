    "intro": "Hydrocotyle poeppigii var. filipes, commonly known as the threadleaf marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, round, fleshy leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces tiny white flowers with five petals, which are borne on slender stalks above the leaves. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist soils. The species is often found in shallow water or damp ground, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat."
