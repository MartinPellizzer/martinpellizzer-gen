    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. tubuliflorum, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a head, with both ray and disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
