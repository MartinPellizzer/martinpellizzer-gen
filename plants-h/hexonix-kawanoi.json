    "intro": "Hexonix kawanoi, commonly known as the Kawano's hexon, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, hexagonal-shaped leaves that are a deep shade of emerald green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom during the late spring and early summer months. Hexonix kawanoi thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
