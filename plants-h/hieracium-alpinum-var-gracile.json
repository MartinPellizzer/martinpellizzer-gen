It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to grow."
