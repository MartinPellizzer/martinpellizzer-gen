    "intro": "Hieracium anaptorthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and it has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and can form dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
