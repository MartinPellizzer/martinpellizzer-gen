    "intro": "Hieracium molliglandulosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in soft, glandular trichomes. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other hawkweed species."
