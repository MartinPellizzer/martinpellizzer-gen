    "intro": "Hypericum thymifolium, commonly known as the thyme-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of northern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are covered in fine, hairy structures that resemble thyme. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is a member of the Hypericaceae family, known for its medicinal properties. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
