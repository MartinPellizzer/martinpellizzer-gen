    "intro": "Hirtella zanzibarica subsp. obtusifolia, commonly known as Zanzibar hirtella, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence that covers its stems and leaves. The leaves are typically elliptic to ovate in shape with rounded or obtuse tips, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, woody fruits. It thrives in humid, coastal environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline."
