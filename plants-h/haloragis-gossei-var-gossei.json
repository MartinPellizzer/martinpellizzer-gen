    "intro": "Haloragis gossei var. gossei, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil."
