    "intro": "Hypodematium crenatum subsp. loyalii, commonly known as the Loyal's hairy bladderwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in China. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap microscopic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are slender and often covered in fine, hair-like structures, which contribute to its common name. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
