    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. bistricense, commonly known as the two-colored hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its two-toned leaves, which are typically green on top and grayish-white underneath. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
