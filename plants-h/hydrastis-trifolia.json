    "intro": "Hydrastis trifolia, commonly known as the three-leaved goldenseal, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by dark blue berries. Hydrastis trifolia is known for its medicinal properties, containing alkaloids such as berberine, which have been used in traditional medicine. However, it is also considered an endangered species due to habitat loss and overharvesting."
