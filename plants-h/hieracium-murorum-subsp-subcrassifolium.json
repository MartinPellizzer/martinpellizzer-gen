    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subcrassifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, broad leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some areas."
