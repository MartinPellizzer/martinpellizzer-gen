    "intro": "Hypolepis aquilinaris, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately compound fronds that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, where it can anchor itself with its rhizomes. Its leaves are typically green and can form dense mats on the water surface. Hypolepis aquilinaris plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen for various aquatic organisms."
