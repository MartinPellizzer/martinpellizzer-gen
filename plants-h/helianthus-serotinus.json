    "intro": "Helianthus serotinus, commonly known as late sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers have a prominent yellow disk surrounded by ray florets. Helianthus serotinus plays an important role in supporting pollinators and is often used in native plant gardens."
