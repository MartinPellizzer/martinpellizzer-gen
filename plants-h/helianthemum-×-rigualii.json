    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 rigualii, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum italicum. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to its natural habitat. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
