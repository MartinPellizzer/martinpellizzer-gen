    "intro": "Hohenbergia arcuata, commonly known as the arcuate hohenbergia, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a compact, water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with bright red or orange bracts that contrast with its dark green foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia arcuata is popular as a decorative houseplant due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
