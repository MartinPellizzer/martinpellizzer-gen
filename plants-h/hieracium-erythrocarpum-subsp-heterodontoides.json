    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. heterodontoides, commonly known as the red-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant produces small, hairy, reddish-brown seeds in its fruiting structures, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native plant communities."
