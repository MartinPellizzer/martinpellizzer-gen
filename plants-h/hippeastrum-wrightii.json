    "intro": "Hippeastrum wrightii, commonly known as the Wright's amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, white, and pink. The plant produces a single, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a fleshy underground bulb. Its flowers are typically borne on a scape, which is a leafless stem that rises directly from the bulb. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
