    "intro": "Hessea pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf hens and chicks plant, is a succulent species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-forming growth habit and features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a powdery bloom. The plant produces delicate, yellowish flowers on tall, branched stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Hessea pusilla is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
