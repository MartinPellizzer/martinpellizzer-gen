    "intro": "Hakea fecunda, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clustered, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, bottlebrush-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom in spring. Hakea fecunda is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
