    "intro": "Hartighsea cauliflora, commonly known as the sea cauliflower, is a unique marine plant found in shallow coastal waters. It exhibits a cauliflower-like structure composed of tightly packed, fleshy, white to pale yellow florets. The plant is characterized by its lack of true roots, instead relying on rhizoids for attachment to substrates. Its reproductive structures are borne on the main stem, a feature known as cauliflorous growth. This plant plays a role in providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
