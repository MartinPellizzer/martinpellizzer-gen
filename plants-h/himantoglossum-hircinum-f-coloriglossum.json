    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. coloriglossum, commonly known as the pink-flowered form of the common twayblade, is a rare and striking orchid with distinctive botanical features. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family, characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and reduced, scale-like foliage. The most notable botanical aspect is its vibrant pink or purple lip, which is highly modified and serves as a pollinator attractant. This form exhibits a unique coloration variation compared to the typical green-flowered variant, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in woodland habitats across Europe."
