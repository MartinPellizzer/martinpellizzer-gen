    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius albanicum, commonly known as the Albanian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
