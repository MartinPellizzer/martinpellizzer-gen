    "intro": "Hoya subglabra, commonly known as the bare-stemmed waxplant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, or red, typically blooming during the summer months. Hoya subglabra is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
