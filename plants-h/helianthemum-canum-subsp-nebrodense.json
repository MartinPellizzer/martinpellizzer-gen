    "intro": "Helianthemum canum subsp. nebrodense, commonly known as the Sicilian rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Sicily and the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
