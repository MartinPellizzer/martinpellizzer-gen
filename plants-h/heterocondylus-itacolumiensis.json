    "intro": "Heterocondylus itacolumiensis, commonly known as the Itacolumi fern, is a rare and little-studied species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a small, terrestrial fern characterized by its delicate, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Due to habitat loss, Heterocondylus itacolumiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists studying plant biodiversity in the region."
