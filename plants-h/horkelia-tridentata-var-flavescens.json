    "intro": "Horkelia tridentata var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is distinguished by its yellow flowers, which contrast with the more commonly seen blue or purple flowers of other horkelia species."
