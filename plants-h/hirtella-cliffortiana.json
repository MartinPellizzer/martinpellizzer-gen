    "intro": "Hirtella cliffortiana, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, round capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds. Hirtella cliffortiana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
