It is characterized by its fleshy, bulbous stem and its clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is also cultivated for ornamental purposes."
