It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a dark central disc. Hieracium melanopum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
