    "intro": "Hemarthria caudiculata, commonly known as the narrowleaf panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Hemarthria caudiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
