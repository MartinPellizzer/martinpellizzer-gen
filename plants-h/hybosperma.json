    "intro": "Hybosperma, commonly known as the \"giant water lily,\" is a large aquatic plant native to South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in diameter, floating on the water's surface. The plant has showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as bats and moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy bottom of lakes and slow-moving rivers. Hybosperma plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to water organisms."
