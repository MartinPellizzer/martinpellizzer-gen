    "intro": "Helosciadium stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping helosciadium, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with stolons that allow it to form dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Helosciadium stoloniferum is typically found in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and along stream banks."
