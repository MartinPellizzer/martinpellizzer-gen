    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. vulgare, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on short stems and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
