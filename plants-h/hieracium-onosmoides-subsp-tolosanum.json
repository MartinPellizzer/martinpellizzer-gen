    "intro": "Hieracium onosmoides subsp. tolosanum, commonly known as the Tolosan hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in open grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features upright stems covered with stiff, hairy leaves that are often lobed or deeply divided. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its role in stabilizing soil in marginal habitats."
