    "intro": "Heracleum artvinense, commonly known as Artvin cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and umbrella-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its flowers are white or pale yellow. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
