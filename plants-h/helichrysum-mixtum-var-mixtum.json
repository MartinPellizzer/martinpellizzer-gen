It features compact, bushy growth with small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
