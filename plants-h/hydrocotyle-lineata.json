    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lineata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a species of flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle lineata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
