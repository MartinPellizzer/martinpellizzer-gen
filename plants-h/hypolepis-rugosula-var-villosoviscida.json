    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula var. villosoviscida, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds with a distinctive, shield-shaped appearance. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces spores on the underside of its leaves, which are typically covered in fine, hairy structures. Its foliage is often covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a velvety texture. This fern thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests."
