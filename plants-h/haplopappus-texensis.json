It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures, which aid in seed dispersal. Haplopappus texensis is often found in open plains and along riverbanks, where it thrives in full sun."
