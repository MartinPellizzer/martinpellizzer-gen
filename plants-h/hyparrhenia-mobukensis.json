    "intro": "Hyparrhenia mobukensis, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its coarse, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Hyparrhenia mobukensis is valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
