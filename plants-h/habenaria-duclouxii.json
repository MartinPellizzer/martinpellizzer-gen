    "intro": "Habenaria duclouxii, commonly known as the Ducloux's orchid, is a species of orchid native to Madagascar. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, featuring a short rhizome and a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant, violet-blue flowers with three sepals and three petals, typically arranged in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
