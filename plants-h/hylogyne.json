    "intro": "Hylogyne, commonly known as the water lily, is a aquatic plant that thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to prevent water loss. The plant's flowers are typically showy, with bright colors that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hylogyne has a unique ability to trap air bubbles in its leaves, which helps it float on the water's surface. Its rhizomes anchor it to the substrate while allowing for the growth of new shoots."
