It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
