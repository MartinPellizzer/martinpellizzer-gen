    "intro": "Hemionitis griffithii var. pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnate leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Its reproductive structures are inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
