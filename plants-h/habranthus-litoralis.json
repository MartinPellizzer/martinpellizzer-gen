    "intro": "Habranthus litoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its tubular, bell-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to pale blue. The plant grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. This species is often found in dune environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes through its extensive root system."
