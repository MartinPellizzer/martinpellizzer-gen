It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a cluster of hands, hence its common name. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that form a rosette, and its flowers are typically orange or red with a yellow center. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is cultivated for its unique appearance in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
