    "intro": "Helichrysum leucocladum, commonly known as the white-haired everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellowish to white flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation across dry regions. Helichrysum leucocladum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
