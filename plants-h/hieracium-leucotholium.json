    "intro": "Hieracium leucotholium, commonly known as the white-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
