    "intro": "Henrya yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan henrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or shaded borders. Due to its limited natural range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
