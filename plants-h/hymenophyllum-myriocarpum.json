    "intro": "Hymenophyllum myriocarpum, commonly known as the many-seeded filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its thin, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sporangia located on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its ability to survive in low-light conditions and its unique reproductive structures."
