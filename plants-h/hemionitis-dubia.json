    "intro": "Hemionitis dubia, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It is a member of the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its small, pale green fronds that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded habitats. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis dubia is considered endangered and requires careful protection."
