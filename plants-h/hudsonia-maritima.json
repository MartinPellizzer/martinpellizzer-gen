    "intro": "Hudsonia maritima, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to the intertidal zones of the Atlantic coast. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in rocky shores and tidal pools. Its leaves are typically short and rounded, adapted to minimize water loss in its fluctuating habitat. Hudsonia maritima plays a role in coastal ecosystems by providing shelter for microorganisms and contributing to the food web."
