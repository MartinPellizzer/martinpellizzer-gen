    "intro": "Hakea filix, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces striking yellow or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea filix is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought resistance through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surface. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in native gardens."
