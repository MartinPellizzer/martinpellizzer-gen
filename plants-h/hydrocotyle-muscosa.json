    "intro": "Hydrocotyle muscosa, commonly known as the water pepper or marsh penny, is a flowering plant belonging to the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the surface of shallow water. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Hydrocotyle muscosa is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
