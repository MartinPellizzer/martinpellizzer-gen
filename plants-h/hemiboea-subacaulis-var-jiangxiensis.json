    "intro": "Hemiboea subacaulis var. jiangxiensis, commonly known as the Jiangxi hemiboea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to southern China. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy, tubular flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
