    "intro": "Heteropterys paraguariensis f. major, commonly known as the Amazonian guarana, is a variant of the guarana plant native to the Amazon rainforest. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its large, hard-shelled seeds that contain high concentrations of caffeine and other stimulants. The botanical features of this variety contribute to its use in traditional medicine and as a source of natural stimulants. Its growth habit and morphology are adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat."
