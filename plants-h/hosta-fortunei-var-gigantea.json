    "intro": "Hosta fortunei var. gigantea, commonly known as the giant fortune hosta, is a striking plant native to China. It is characterized by its large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length. The foliage is typically a deep, vibrant green, often with a slight blue or grayish tint. It produces small, fragrant white flowers in late summer, though they are less showy than the foliage. This variety thrives in partial to full shade and requires moist, well-drained soil."
