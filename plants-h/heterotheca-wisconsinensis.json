    "intro": "Heterotheca wisconsinensis, commonly known as Wisconsin goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and northern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as prairies, roadsides, and fields. It produces small yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules. Heterotheca wisconsinensis is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its ability to stabilize soil in native landscapes."
