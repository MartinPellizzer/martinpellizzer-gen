It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Hypserpa parvifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a distinctive species within the family Rubiaceae."
