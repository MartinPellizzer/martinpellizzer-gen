    "intro": "Hibbertia incurvata, commonly known as the warty sand-verbena, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and have a warty texture, which helps reduce water loss. Hibbertia incurvata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
