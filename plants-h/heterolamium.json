    "intro": "Heterolamium, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The flowers are typically clustered in racemes and feature five petals, often with a distinctive yellow or white coloration. Heterolamium species are native to tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. These plants are sometimes considered invasive in certain areas due to their rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
