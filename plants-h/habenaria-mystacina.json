    "intro": "Habenaria mystacina, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green, strap-like leaves and its striking, white, fragrant flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine rocklands and other humid habitats. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
