It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has a sprawling growth habit with creeping stolons. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium divaricans is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense mats, sometimes becoming invasive in certain regions."
