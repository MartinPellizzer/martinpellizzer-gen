It features large, broad leaves that can span several feet in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that bloom at night, attracting pollinators such as moths. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its stems provide structural support for the foliage. Hydrosme gigantiflora plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by offering habitat and shade for various aquatic organisms."
