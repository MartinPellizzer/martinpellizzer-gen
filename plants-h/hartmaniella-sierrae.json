    "intro": "Hartmaniella sierrae, commonly known as the Sierra hartmaniella, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the dry, sunny conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
