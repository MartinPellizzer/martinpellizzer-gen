    "intro": "Hieracium cathaemum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer, are composed of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Hieracium cathaemum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
