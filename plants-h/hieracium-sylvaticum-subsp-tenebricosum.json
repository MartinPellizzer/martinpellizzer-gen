It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, surrounded by bracts, and are often visited by pollinators like bees. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker foliage and more elongated flowering stems compared to other members of the genus."
