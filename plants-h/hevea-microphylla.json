    "intro": "Hevea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are small in size and have a smooth, waxy surface. The tree produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsules containing numerous seeds. It is primarily cultivated for its latex, which is used in the production of natural rubber. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is often found in both natural and managed forest environments."
