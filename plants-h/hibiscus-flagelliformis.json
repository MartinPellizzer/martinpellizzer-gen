    "intro": "Hibiscus flagelliformis, commonly known as the whip hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its long, slender, whip-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Hibiscus flagelliformis is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and resilience in warm climates."
