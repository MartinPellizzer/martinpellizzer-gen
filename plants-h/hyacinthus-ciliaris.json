    "intro": "Hyacinthus ciliaris, commonly known as the Persian hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It produces dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that emerge from a bulbous base. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early blooming habit and delicate, bell-shaped flowers."
