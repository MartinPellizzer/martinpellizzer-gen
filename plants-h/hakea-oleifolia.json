    "intro": "Hakea oleifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking clusters of bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to dry climates and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Hakea oleifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in native gardens."
