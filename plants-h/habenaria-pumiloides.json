    "intro": "Habenaria pumiloides, commonly known as the dwarf orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinct lip that is often darker in color. It has a rhizomatous root system and possesses pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often challenging to cultivate outside its natural range."
