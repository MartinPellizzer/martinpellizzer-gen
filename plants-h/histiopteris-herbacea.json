    "intro": "Histiopteris herbacea, commonly known as the slender tree fern, is a species of tree fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, pinnate fronds that can reach several meters in length. The plant has a unique ability to form a crown of fronds at the top of its trunk, which gives it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. The fronds are used in traditional M\u0101ori culture for various purposes, including weaving and construction."
