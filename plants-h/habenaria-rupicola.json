    "intro": "Habenaria rupicola, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in forested or mountainous regions. The plant produces slender, upright stems with few leaves and bears small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the mineral-rich substrates it inhabits. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
