    "intro": "Hieracium macrocephaloides, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1 meter in height, with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
