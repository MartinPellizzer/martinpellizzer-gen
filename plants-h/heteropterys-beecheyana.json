It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that give way to round, spiny fruits resembling a greenish-yellow apple. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine. The plant's morphology and growth habits are well adapted to the humid, shaded environments of its native habitat."
