    "intro": "Hedysarum pallidiflorum, commonly known as the pale-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has small, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum pallidiflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation in ecological systems."
