    "intro": "Hortsmania pubiflora, commonly known as the velvet-flowered orchid, is a striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and clusters of showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, playing a vital role in its ecosystem. Due to habitat destruction, Hortsmania pubiflora is now considered a rare and endangered species."
