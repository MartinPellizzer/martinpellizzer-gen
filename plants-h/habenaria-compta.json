It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in humid tropical and subtropical regions."
