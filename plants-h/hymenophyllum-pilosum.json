    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pilosum, commonly known as the hairy toothed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It has delicate, lance-shaped fronds covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the undersides of the fronds. Hymenophyllum pilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
