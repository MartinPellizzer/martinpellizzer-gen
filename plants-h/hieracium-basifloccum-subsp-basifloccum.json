    "intro": "Hieracium basifloccum subsp. basifloccum, commonly known as the basal flocculent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in dense, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are usually inconspicuous. The subspecies is characterized by its basal flocculence, which refers to the dense, flocculent (fluffy) covering on the lower stem and leaves."
