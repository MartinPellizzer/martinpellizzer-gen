    "intro": "Hieracium nigritipes, commonly known as the black-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky or disturbed soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
