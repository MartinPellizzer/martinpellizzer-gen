    "intro": "Hopea ovoidea, commonly known as the oval-fruit hopea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The plant is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and lanceolate leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, yellowish flowers are borne in clusters, and the fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. Hopea ovoidea is often found in lowland dipterocarp forests and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of these habitats."
