    "intro": "Hydranthelium crenatum, commonly known as the serrated hydranthelium, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are adapted for wind pollination, and it plays a role in supporting local insect biodiversity. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
