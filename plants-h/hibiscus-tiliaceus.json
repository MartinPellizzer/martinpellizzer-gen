    "intro": "Hibiscus tiliaceus, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus or sea hibiscus, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. The plant thrives in saline and humid environments, often found along shores and in mangrove areas. Its fibrous bark and leaves have been used traditionally for various purposes, including thatching and medicinal applications. Hibiscus tiliaceus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for marine and terrestrial wildlife."
