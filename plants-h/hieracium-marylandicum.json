    "intro": "Hieracium marylandicum, commonly known as Maryland hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces yellow flowers with white ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Maryland hawkweed is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in certain environments."
