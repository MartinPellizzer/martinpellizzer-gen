It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it has hairy, often prickly stems and leaves. Hieracium aculeidens is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread rapidly through its rhizomes. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
