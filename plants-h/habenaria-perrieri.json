    "intro": "Habenaria perrieri, commonly known as the Perrier's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually oval and arranged in a rosette pattern, and the flowers are often pale green or white with intricate patterns. Habitat destruction and over-collection have made it a rare and endangered species in its native range."
