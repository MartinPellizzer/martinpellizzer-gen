    "intro": "Hymenophyllum copelandianum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum copelandianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
