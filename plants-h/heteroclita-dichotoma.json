It is characterized by its dichotomous branching pattern, where the fronds split into two equal parts at each node. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a delicate, feathery appearance. Heteroclita dichotoma is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
