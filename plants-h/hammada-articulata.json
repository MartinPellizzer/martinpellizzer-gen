    "intro": "Hammada articulata, commonly known as the desert holly, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help store water, adapting it to harsh, drought-prone environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its stems are often branched and can grow up to several feet tall, with a rugged, woody texture. Hammada articulata is valued for its resilience and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
