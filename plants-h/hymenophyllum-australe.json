    "intro": "Hymenophyllum australe, commonly known as the Australian moss-fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rock crevices or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum australe plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and supporting microhabitats in its native ecosystems."
