    "intro": "Houstonia subviscosa, commonly known as sticky blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the genus Houstonia in the family Poaceae, although some classifications place it in the family Cyperaceae. The plant is characterized by its dense clusters of small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are often covered in a sticky substance, giving it its common name. Houstonia subviscosa typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
