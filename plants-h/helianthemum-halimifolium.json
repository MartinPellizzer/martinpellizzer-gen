    "intro": "Helianthemum halimifolium, commonly known as the rock rose or sweet rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
