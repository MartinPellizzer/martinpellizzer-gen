    "intro": "Hieracium atrisquamum, commonly known as the blackleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a dark green color. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
