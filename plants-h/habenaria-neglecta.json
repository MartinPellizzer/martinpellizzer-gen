    "intro": "Habenaria neglecta, commonly known as the neglected orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems that bear multiple linear leaves. The plant's flowers are small and usually pale green or white, with three sepals and three petals, and a distinctive labellum. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
