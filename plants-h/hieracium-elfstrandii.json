It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are usually hairy and elongated, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
