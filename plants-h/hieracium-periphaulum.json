It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it has basal leaves that are typically hairy and lobed.

Its growth habit is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies."
