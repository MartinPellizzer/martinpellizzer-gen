    "intro": "Heliomeris, commonly known as the sunflower bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are native to Africa, Australia, and parts of the Americas, and they are often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Heliomeris species are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The leaves are usually palmately lobed, and the plants often have a sprawling or shrub-like growth habit. They are adapted to thrive in hot, dry conditions and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
