    "intro": "Hoya lyi, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of waxy, coral-pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The leaves are thick, glossy, and oval-shaped, often with a slight waxy coating. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya lyi is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ability to add a touch of elegance to any space."
