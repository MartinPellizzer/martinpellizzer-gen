    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. cottianum, commonly known as the Cottian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and stems that bear yellow ray florets surrounded by a ring of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and poor nutrient conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
