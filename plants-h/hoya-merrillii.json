    "intro": "Hoya merrillii, commonly known as the \"Merrill's wax plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of Thailand and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. Hoya merrillii produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in umbellate inflorescences. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light conditions."
