    "intro": "Hakea stenostachya, commonly known as the narrow-stamened hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like foliage that provides habitat for various small animals. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Hakea stenostachya plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value."
