    "intro": "Hippocrepis monocarpa, commonly known as the single-fruited rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing several small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often arranged in a basal rosette. The fruit is a capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed or rocky habitats."
