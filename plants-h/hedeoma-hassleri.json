    "intro": "Hedeoma hassleri, commonly known as the desert hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring small, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Hedeoma hassleri is adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to access groundwater and survive prolonged droughts. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of desert ecosystems."
