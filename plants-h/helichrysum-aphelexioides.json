    "intro": "Helichrysum aphelexioides, commonly known as the Cape gold or golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking clusters of small, bright yellow flowers. The plant produces papery, golden-orange bracts that persist on the plant even after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting ornamental appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The species is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
