    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. euryphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, dry fruits called achenes. The subspecies is characterized by its broader leaves compared to the typical H. pilosella, which contributes to its distinct botanical appearance."
