    "intro": "Haemanthus zambesiacus, commonly known as the Zambesian grass-of-paraguay, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of broad, glossy, dark green leaves that are stiff and upright. The plant produces striking red or orange inflorescences that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to flower reliably in cooler climates."
