    "intro": "Hartighsea gobara, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant features delicate, pale green leaves and produces small, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghosts, giving it its common name. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hartighsea gobara is considered a vulnerable species."
