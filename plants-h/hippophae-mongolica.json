    "intro": "Hippophae mongolica, commonly known as the Chinese sandthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of northern China, Mongolia, and Russia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and orange-red berries, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that help it survive in sandy and saline soils. Its leaves are small and oval, often covered with a fine layer of wax to reduce water loss. The species plays an important ecological role in preventing soil erosion and supporting local wildlife."
