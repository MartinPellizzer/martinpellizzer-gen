    "intro": "Howardia macroura, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a striking member of the Orchidaceae family native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated petals that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a unique, spurred shape that aids in pollination by specific insects. Howardia macroura is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid environments."
