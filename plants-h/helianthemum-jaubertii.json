    "intro": "Helianthemum jaubertii, commonly known as the Jaubert's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum jaubertii is well adapted to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
