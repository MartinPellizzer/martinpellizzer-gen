    "intro": "Hermannia dregeana, commonly known as the purple-stemmed angel's trumpet, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, hairy stems that are often tinged with purple, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a velvety texture with a slightly serrated edge. Hermannia dregeana is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
