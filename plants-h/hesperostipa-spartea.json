    "intro": "Hesperostipa spartea, commonly known as the desert needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear pale to golden bristles, which are adapted for wind pollination. Hesperostipa spartea is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a common component of sagebrush steppe and desert grassland ecosystems. Its ecological importance includes providing forage for wildlife and stabilizing soil in fragile desert environments."
