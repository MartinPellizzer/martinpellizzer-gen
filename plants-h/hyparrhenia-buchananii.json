It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Hyparrhenia buchananii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
