    "intro": "Heliophila edentula, commonly known as the toothless heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its leaves are finely divided, resembling those of other members of its family. Heliophila edentula is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
