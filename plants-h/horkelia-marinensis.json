    "intro": "Horkelia marinensis, commonly known as the coastal horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in coastal areas of California and Oregon. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. Horkelia marinensis thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dune habitats and providing nectar for pollinators."
