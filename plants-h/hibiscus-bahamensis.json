    "intro": "Hibiscus bahamensis, commonly known as the Bahamian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly the Bahamas. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange with a red throat, and they bloom throughout the growing season. This species is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, often found in mangrove swamps and salt marshes. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
