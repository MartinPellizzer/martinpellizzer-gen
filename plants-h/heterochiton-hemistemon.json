    "intro": "Heterochiton hemistemon, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a unique lichen species characterized by its intricate symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rock surfaces in arid and semi-arid environments, forming a crust-like structure that adheres tightly to the substrate. The plant's thallus is usually dark green to blackish in color, with a granular or powdery texture that helps it retain moisture in harsh conditions. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, relying instead on its algal partner for photosynthesis and the fungal component for nutrient absorption. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental conditions due to its sensitivity to pollution and climate changes."
