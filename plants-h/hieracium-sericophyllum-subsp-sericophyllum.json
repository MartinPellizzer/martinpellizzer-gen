It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically yellow or pale orange. It is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other members of the Hieracium genus."
