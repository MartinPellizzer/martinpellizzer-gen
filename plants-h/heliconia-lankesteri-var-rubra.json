    "intro": "Heliconia lankesteri var. rubra, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, yellowish-white true flowers nestled within the bracts. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. The red heliconia is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
