    "intro": "Haworthia subtortuosa, commonly known as the twisted Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with prominent white or yellow markings. The leaves are often twisted or curled, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a potted specimen due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
