    "intro": "Hookera orcuttii, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Hookera orcuttii has small, basal leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Its unique adaptations make it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
