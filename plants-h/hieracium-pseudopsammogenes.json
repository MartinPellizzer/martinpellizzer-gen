It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. It produces yellow flowers from June to August, which attract various pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
