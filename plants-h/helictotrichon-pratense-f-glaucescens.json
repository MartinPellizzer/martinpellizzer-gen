    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. glaucescens, commonly known as the glaucous bluegrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage. It typically grows in moist to mesic habitats, such as meadows and grasslands, and is native to parts of North America. The plant features slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly hairy, and its leaves are narrow with a prominent midvein. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) appearance, which gives it its common name."
