    "intro": "Heliotropium cerroleonense, commonly known as the Cerroleonese heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean island of Cerrol\u00e9on. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of small, violet-colored flowers that bloom in the late afternoon. Its leaves are ovate and have a slightly serrated edge, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its island habitat."
