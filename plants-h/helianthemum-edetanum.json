    "intro": "Helianthemum edetanum, commonly known as the Edetanum rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Helianthemum edetanum is well adapted to full sun and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for gardens in warm climates."
