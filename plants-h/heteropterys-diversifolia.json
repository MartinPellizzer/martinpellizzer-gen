    "intro": "Heteropterys diversifolia, commonly known as the Brazilian pepper tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to South America. It features compound leaves with alternate, lanceolate leaflets that are often hairy and have a distinctive reddish or purple coloration. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed sites. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
