    "intro": "Hydroglossum microstachyum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in temperate regions. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, showy blue or violet flowers arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly waxy texture, adapted to retain moisture in moist habitats. Hydroglossum microstachyum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
