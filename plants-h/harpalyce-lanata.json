It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Harpalyce lanata is a member of the Leguminosae family, which includes many plants with nitrogen-fixing capabilities. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in desert ecosystems."
