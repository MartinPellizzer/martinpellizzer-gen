    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 istriacum, commonly known as the Istrian sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, dense foliage with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
