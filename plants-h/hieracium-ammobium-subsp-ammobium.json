It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges.
