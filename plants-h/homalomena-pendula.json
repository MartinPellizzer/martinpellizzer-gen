    "intro": "Homalomena pendula, commonly known as the hanging arrowhead plant, is a tropical evergreen perennial native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its arrow-shaped, waxy leaves that grow in a spiral pattern along its upright stems. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor cultivation in warm climates."
