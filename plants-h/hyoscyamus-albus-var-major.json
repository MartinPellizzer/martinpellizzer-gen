It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and distinctive, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous small, oval seeds. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a poisonous plant and should be handled with care."
