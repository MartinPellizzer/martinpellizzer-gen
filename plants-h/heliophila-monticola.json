    "intro": "Heliophila monticola, commonly known as the mountain heliophila, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heliophila monticola is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
