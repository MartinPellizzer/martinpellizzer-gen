    "intro": "Hannafordia quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its unique feature is the four-valved structure of its seed capsules, which open to release seeds. Hannafordia quadrivalvis is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments."
