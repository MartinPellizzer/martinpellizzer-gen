    "intro": "Huernia rosea, commonly known as the horned lithops, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that resemble small, pointed horns, which help it store water. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent collectors and gardeners."
