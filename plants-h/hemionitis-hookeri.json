    "intro": "Hemionitis hookeri, commonly known as the water hawthorn, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in muddy substrates, while its roots aid in filtering water. Hemionitis hookeri is valued in traditional medicine and is also used in water gardens for its ornamental appeal."
