    "intro": "Hugueninia tanacetifolia, commonly known as the mountain huckleberry, is a shrub native to the high elevations of the western United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense clusters of small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its leaves are typically arranged in a whorled pattern, and the plant is well adapted to cold, dry, and rocky environments. Hugueninia tanacetifolia is an important component of alpine and subalpine ecosystems, providing food for various wildlife species."
