    "intro": "Hoya celsa, commonly known as the wax plant or porcelain flower, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can range in color from deep green to shades of white and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in response to bright, indirect light. Hoya celsa is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in a variety of indoor conditions. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
