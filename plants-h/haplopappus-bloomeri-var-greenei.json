    "intro": "Haplopappus bloomeri var. greenei, commonly known as the Greene's hairy pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has a low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are usually hairy and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its unique pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal."
