It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is known for its aggressive growth and is considered a weed in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly."
