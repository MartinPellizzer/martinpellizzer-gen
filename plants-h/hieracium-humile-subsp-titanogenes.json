It typically forms dense mats of slender, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
