    "intro": "Hohenbergia horrida, commonly known as the spiked hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in sharp, spiny protrusions, giving it a unique and somewhat intimidating appearance. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that can range in color from red to orange, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
