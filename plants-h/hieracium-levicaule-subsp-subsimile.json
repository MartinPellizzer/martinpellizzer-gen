    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. subsimile, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. The subspecies subsimile is distinguished by its slightly smaller stature and more compact inflorescences compared to other members of the species."
