    "intro": "Haemanthus pubescens, commonly known as the Natal grassbladder, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
