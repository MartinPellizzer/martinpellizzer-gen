    "intro": "Hieracium glaucolissodes, commonly known as the pale blue hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and produces showy yellow to orange composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has hairy stems and is often found in disturbed areas due to its adaptability. The plant is also known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
