    "intro": "Hieracium thlaspidiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Hieracium thlaspidiforme is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
