    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 latisquamum subsp. diaporphyrum, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
