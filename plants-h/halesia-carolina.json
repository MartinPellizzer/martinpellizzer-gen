It is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped white flowers that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The tree has smooth, gray bark and elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Halesia carolina is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
