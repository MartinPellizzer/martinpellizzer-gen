    "intro": "Hydrosme foetida, commonly known as the stinking water lily, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features broad, floating leaves and distinctive yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in the early morning. Its name derives from the strong, unpleasant odor it emits, which is thought to attract certain pollinators. Hydrosme foetida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
