    "intro": "Holcus fulvus var. nitidus, commonly known as the glossy hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, glossy green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of wax. The inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged along a slender stem, producing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along the edges of wetlands. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
