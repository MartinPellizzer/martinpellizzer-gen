    "intro": "Heterospathe compsoclada, commonly known as the slender swamp fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with silver or pale green. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and forest understories. Its fronds are pinnately divided, with small, rounded pinnae that contribute to its ornamental appeal. The reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
