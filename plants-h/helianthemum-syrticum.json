    "intro": "Helianthemum syrticum, commonly known as the rock rose of the Libyan Desert, is a flowering plant native to North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent structure helps it store water, making it well-suited for harsh, dry environments. Helianthemum syrticum is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic species of the Mediterranean and desert regions."
