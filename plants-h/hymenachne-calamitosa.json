The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowering structures consist of small, spike-like inflorescences that produce tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hymenachne calamitosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
