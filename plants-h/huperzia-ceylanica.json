    "intro": "Huperzia ceylanica, commonly known as the Ceylon huperzia, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules that are often protected by a peristome. Huperzia ceylanica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
