    "intro": "Hydastylus serrulatus, commonly known as the serrated waterleaf, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in humid and moist conditions. Its leaves are often floating or partially submerged, contributing to its aquatic habitat. Hydastylus serrulatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic life."
