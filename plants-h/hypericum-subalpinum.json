    "intro": "Hypericum subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, cold climates with limited soil nutrients. Hypericum subalpinum is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
