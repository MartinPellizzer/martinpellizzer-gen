    "intro": "Hieracium anfractum subsp. subampliatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate to ovate leaves. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
