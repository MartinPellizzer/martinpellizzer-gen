It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming during the warm season. Hibiscus thegaleus is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. It is also known for its use in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant in gardens."
