It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized orchid species."
