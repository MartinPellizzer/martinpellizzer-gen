    "intro": "Hedysarum exaltatum, commonly known as the tall milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and has a deep root system that helps stabilize soil. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Hedysarum exaltatum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for ecological restoration projects."
