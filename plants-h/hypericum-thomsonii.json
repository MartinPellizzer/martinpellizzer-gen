It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, orange-red fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Botanically, it belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic in large doses."
