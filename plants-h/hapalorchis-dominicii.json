It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its habitat. Hapalorchis dominicii is often used in ecological studies to assess environmental health and biodiversity."
