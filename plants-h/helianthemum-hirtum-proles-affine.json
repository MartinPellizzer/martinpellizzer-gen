    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum proles affine, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, low-maintenance plants."
