    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum subsp. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
