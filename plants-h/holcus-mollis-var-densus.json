    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. densus, commonly known as dense hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, narrow spikelet that is usually shorter than the leaf blades. Dense hairgrass is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
