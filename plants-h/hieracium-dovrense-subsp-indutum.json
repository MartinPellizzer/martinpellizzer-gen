    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense subsp. indutum, commonly known as the woolly meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Native to Europe, this species thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which gives it a woolly appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits, typical of the Asteraceae family."
