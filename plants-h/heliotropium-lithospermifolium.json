    "intro": "Heliotropium lithospermifolium, commonly known as the stone root heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial herb with erect, branched stems that often grow in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically violet or purple in color, blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its roots are thick and fleshy, adapted for storing water. It is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
