    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 verguinii, commonly known as the hybrid yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces numerous small, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
