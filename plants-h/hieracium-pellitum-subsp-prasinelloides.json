    "intro": "Hieracium pellitum subsp. prasinelloides, commonly known as the green-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
