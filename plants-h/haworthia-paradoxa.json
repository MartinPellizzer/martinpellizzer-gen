    "intro": "Haworthia paradoxa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and rock garden displays."
