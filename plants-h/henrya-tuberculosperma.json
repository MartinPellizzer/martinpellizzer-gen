    "intro": "Henrya tuberculosperma, commonly known as the mountain heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in cool, moist, and well-drained soil conditions. The plant features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, appear in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer. Henrya tuberculosperma is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
