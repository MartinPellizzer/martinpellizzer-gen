    "intro": "Hieracium semiangustum, commonly known as narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
