    "intro": "Hottonia serrata, commonly known as the water hottonia, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. The plant features submerged leaves that are narrow and serrated, which help in capturing light and reducing water resistance. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in loose inflorescences, often floating at the water's surface. Hottonia serrata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
