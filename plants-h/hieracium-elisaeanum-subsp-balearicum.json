It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and coastal areas. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, inconspicuous florets arranged in a composite head. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
