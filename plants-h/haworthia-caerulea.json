    "intro": "Haworthia caerulea, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months. Haworthia caerulea is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
