    "intro": "Hakea rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive red or orange flowers that appear in winter. The plant has a woody structure with thick, persistent branches, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Hakea rostrata is adapted to arid conditions, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for dryland gardens. It plays an important role in providing habitat for native wildlife."
