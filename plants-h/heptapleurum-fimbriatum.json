It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its glossy, ovate leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. It typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. The flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in umbels, and are followed by orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species."
