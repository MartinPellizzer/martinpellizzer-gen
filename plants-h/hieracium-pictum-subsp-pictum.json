    "intro": "Hieracium pictum subsp. pictum, commonly known as the painted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with purple markings. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
