    "intro": "Hydrocleys azurea, commonly known as blue water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers that are clustered in spikes, adding a delicate aesthetic to its aquatic habitat. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrocleys azurea is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to improve water quality."
