    "intro": "Helictotrichon versicolor subsp. caucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue that gives it its common name. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
