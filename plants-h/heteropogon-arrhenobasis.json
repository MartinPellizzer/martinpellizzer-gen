    "intro": "Heteropogon arrhenobasis, commonly known as the male grass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wetlands, and is often found in association with other wetland vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
