    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. subditivum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and elongated, flowering stems. The plant produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, often shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flowering habits."
