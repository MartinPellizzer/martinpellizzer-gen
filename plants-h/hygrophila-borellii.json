    "intro": "Hygrophila borellii, commonly known as the water hygrophila, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the warm season. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes. Hygrophila borellii is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water."
