    "intro": "Hammada schmittiana, commonly known as the Schmitt's prickly pear, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, paddle-shaped stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the spring and summer months, which are pollinated by various insects. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rapid water absorption. Hammada schmittiana is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
