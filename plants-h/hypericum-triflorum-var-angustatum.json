    "intro": "Hypericum triflorum var. angustatum, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and opposite, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typical of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, sandy soils. Its medicinal properties, though less studied than other Hypericum species, have been historically noted for their potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects."
