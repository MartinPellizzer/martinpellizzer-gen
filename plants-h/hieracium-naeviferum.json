    "intro": "Hieracium naeviferum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flower heads consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
