    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. sagittifrons, commonly known as the arrowhead hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head, which are surrounded by a series of involucral bracts. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is characterized by its hairy stems and finely divided leaves. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf morphology and flower structure."
