    "intro": "Himalaiella abnormis, commonly known as the Himalayan spurge, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the summer months. Himalaiella abnormis is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in alpine flora."
