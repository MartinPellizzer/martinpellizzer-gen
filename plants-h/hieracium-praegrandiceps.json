It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and large, heart-shaped leaves with a serrated edge. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
