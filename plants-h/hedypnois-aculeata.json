    "intro": "Hedypnois aculeata, commonly known as the spiny ant plant, is a unique species within the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the humid forests of South America, particularly in regions of Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, a feature common among bromeliads. Its most distinctive trait is the presence of stiff, spiny projections along the leaf margins, which provide structural support and possibly deter herbivores. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically pollinated by insects rather than by wind."
