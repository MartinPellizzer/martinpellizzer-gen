    "intro": "Hymenolepis henryi, commonly known as the Henry's cycad, is a member of the Cycadaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a dioecious plant, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and it produces cones rather than flowers. The plant has a tall, unbranched trunk with a crown of feathery leaves that are pinnately compound. Its botanical features include a thick, fibrous root system and a slow growth rate, making it a long-lived species. Hymenolepis henryi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also of interest in botanical research due to its ancient lineage."
