    "intro": "Hyacinthoides kabylica, commonly known as the Kabylica squill, is a rare and delicate plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the Asparagaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring, producing white or pale blue flowers that are highly attractive to pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this unique botanical gem from habitat loss and over-collection."
