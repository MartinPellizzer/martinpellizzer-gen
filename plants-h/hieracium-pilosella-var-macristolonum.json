    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella var. macristolonum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower head made up of numerous tiny florets. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
