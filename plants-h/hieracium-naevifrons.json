It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant has hairy, rough leaves and produces numerous small, bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
