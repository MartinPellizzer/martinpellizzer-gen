    "intro": "Hypericum acutum subsp. corsicum, commonly known as the Corsican St. John's Wort, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
