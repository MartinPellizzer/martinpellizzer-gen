    "intro": "Heracleum angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The plant is notable for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which is more pronounced in its mature stages."
