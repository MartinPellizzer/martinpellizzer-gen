It features a basal rosette of dark green, spiny leaves that turn black with age, giving it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
