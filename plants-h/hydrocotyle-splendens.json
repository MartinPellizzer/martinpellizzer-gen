    "intro": "Hydrocotyle splendens, commonly known as the shining arrowhead, is a tropical aquatic plant native to regions in South America. It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating. The plant thrives in shallow, still waters and can be found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of lakes. Its stems are usually submerged, while the leaves float on the water surface. Hydrocotyle splendens is often used in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water."
