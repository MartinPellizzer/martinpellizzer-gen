    "intro": "Helictotrichon alpinum subsp. adsurgens, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its adaptability to extreme climates, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
