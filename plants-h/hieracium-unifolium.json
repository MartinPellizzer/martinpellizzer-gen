It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
