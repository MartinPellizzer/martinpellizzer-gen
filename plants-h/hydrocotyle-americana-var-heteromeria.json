    "intro": "Hydrocotyle americana var. heteromeria, commonly known as the Florida arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface, with some leaves submerged. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in wetland environments such as marshes and ponds, often forming dense mats. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
