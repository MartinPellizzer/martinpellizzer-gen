    "intro": "Hieracium arvicola subsp. cincinnocladum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is adapted to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat."
