    "intro": "Heracleum palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. It produces umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found in moist, shady areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its hollow stems and aromatic foliage make it a distinctive and recognizable species. However, it can be invasive in some regions and is sometimes considered a weed."
