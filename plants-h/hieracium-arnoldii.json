    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius arnoldii, commonly known as Arnold's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Arnold's hawkweed is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
