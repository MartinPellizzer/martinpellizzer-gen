    "intro": "Hicriopteris reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hicriopteris reflexa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen through photosynthesis."
