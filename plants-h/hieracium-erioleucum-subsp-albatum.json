    "intro": "Hieracium erioleucum subsp. albatum, commonly known as the albatross hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
