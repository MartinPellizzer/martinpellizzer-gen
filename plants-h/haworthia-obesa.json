    "intro": "Haworthia obesa, commonly known as the football plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a swollen, rounded stem that resembles a football, which stores water for survival in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pointed leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. It blooms with tall, spiky inflorescences that bear white or yellow flowers. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
