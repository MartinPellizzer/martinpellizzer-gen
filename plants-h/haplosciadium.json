    "intro": "Haplosciadium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed senna, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in racemes, and are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant produces small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. Haplosciadium species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dry, open habitats."
