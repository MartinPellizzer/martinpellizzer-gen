It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture. It produces yellow flowers from late spring to early autumn, contributing to its ecological role in pollinator habitats."
