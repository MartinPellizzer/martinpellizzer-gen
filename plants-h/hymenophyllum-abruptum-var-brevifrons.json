    "intro": "Hymenophyllum abruptum var. brevifrons, commonly known as the narrow-fruited shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often hairy fronds, which are typically dark green and have a distinctive, shield-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in montane forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat."
