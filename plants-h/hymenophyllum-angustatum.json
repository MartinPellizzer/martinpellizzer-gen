    "intro": "Hymenophyllum angustatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf haircap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. This fern typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are usually only a few centimeters long, and they are often clustered closely together. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns."
