    "intro": "Hieracium reayense, commonly known as Reay's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
