It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Pennsylvania hawkweed is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments and is considered a common wildflower in its native range."
