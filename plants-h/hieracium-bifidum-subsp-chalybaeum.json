It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually heart-shaped or lobed. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
