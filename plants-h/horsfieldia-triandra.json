    "intro": "Horsfieldia triandra, commonly known as the Malayan orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of white and pink. The plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Horsfieldia triandra is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
