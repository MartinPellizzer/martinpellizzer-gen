    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ramiflora var. maritima, commonly known as sea mallow or coastal pennywort, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in estuarine and tidal marsh habitats. Its adaptability to saltwater and brackish environments makes it an important component of coastal vegetation."
