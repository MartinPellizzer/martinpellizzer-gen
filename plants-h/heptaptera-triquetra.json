    "intro": "Heptaptera triquetra, commonly known as the three-lobed liverwort, is a small, leafy liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, three-lobed thallus that is typically flattened and ribbon-like in appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as gemmae, are produced in clusters and aid in vegetative propagation. Heptaptera triquetra is an important indicator species for assessing the health of moist, undisturbed habitats."
