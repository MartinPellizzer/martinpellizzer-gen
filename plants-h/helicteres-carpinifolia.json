It is characterized by its palmate leaves and showy, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The tree produces large, spiky fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can reach heights of up to 20 meters. The bark is smooth and grayish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
