    "intro": "Hypochaeris grandidentata, commonly known as the large-lobed weed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in open fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. It has hairy stems and lobed leaves, and its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. Hypochaeris grandidentata is often considered a weed but can serve as a source of nectar for pollinators."
