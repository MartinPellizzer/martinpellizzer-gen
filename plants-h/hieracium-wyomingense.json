    "intro": "Hieracium wyomingense, commonly known as the Wyoming hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly Wyoming and surrounding regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium wyomingense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly in new environments."
