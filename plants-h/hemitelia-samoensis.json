    "intro": "Hemitelia samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
