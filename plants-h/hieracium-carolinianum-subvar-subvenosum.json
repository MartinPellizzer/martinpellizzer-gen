It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in leaf venation and overall morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
