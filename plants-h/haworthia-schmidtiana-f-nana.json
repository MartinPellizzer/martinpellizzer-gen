    "intro": "Haworthia schmidtiana f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pinkish markings, arranged in a rosette formation. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall stems during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
