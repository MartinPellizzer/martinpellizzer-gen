It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It produces small, elliptical berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds.
