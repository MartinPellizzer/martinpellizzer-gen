It features small, showy flowers that range from pink to red, typically blooming in spring. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
