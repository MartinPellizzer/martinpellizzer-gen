    "intro": "Hydrocotyle yucatanensis, commonly known as the Yucatan spurge, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white\u7ed2\u6bdb, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hydrocotyle yucatanensis plays a role in local ecosystems but is considered an invasive species in some areas outside its native range."
