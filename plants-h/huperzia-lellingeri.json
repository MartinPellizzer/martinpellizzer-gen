    "intro": "Huperzia lellingeri, commonly known as the Lellinger's clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and erect, spore-bearing shoots that produce cone-like structures called strobila. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in whorls, giving it a distinctive appearance. Huperzia lellingeri plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
