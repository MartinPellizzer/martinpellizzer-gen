    "intro": "Hemigraphis dorensis var. pilosibracteata, commonly known as the velvet leaf plant, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features striking, velvety foliage with a deep green to reddish-brown hue, often adorned with silver or white markings. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in spikes, though they are not the primary ornamental feature. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its unique leaf texture and coloration make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
