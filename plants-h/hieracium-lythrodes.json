    "intro": "Hieracium lythrodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium lythrodes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
