    "intro": "Hordeum complanatum, commonly known as flatgrain or flatgrass, is a species of wild barley native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, often disturbed soils such as along stream banks and in meadows. The plant has slender, flat leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a hollow, jointed stem. Hordeum complanatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
