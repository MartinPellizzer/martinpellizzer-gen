    "intro": "Hieracium glaciellum, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically has bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found on rocky slopes and tundra. Hieracium glaciellum plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh climates and supports local pollinator populations."
