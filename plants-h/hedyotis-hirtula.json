    "intro": "Hedyotis hirtula, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan. It typically features slender, creeping stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis hirtula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks."
