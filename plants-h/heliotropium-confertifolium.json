    "intro": "Heliotropium confertifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, often woolly foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant is an annual or short-lived perennial, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Heliotropium confertifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
