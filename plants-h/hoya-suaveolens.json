    "intro": "Hoya suaveolens, commonly known as the sweet-scented wax plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is a flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya suaveolens is popular as a houseplant due to its ease of care and ornamental appeal."
