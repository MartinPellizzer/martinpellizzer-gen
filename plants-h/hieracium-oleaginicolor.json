    "intro": "Hieracium oleaginicolor, commonly known as the oil-rich hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium oleaginicolor is known for its high oil content in its stems and leaves, which has led to interest in its potential uses in biofuel production. It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils."
