    "intro": "Hemigraphis hirsuta var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hemigraphis, is a low-growing perennial plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It features dense, velvety foliage with broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red or pink, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and compact growth habit."
