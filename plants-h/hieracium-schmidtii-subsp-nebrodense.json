    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodense hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, daisy-like inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
