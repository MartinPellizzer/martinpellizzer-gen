It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
