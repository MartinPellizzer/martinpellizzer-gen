    "intro": "Habenaria verdickii, commonly known as the velvet orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, velvety purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The leaves are broad and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat."
