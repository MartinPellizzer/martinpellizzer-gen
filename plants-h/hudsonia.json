    "intro": "Hudsonia, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It features succulent, blue-green foliage and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. Hudsonia is adapted to coastal climates and is drought-tolerant once established. Its unique floral structure and ability to withstand salt spray make it a distinctive member of the Campanulaceae family."
