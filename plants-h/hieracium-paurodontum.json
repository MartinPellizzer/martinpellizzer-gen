    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium paurodontum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium paurodontum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
