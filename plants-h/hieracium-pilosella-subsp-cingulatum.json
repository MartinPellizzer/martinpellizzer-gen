    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. cingulatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of the stem. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts that are often glandular and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance. The subspecies is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which help distinguish it from other members of the Hieracium genus."
