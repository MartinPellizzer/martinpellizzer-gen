    "intro": "Haplophyllum rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leafed haplophyllum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants commonly known as buckwheats. The plant is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in early summer. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
