    "intro": "Habenaria sparsiflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
