It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the surface of freshwater habitats. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with soft, muddy or sandy substrates. Its botanical structure is adapted for aquatic life, with specialized leaves that aid in photosynthesis and nutrient absorption."
