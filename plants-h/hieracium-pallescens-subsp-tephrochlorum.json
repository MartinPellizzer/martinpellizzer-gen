    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. tephrochlorum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, which is surrounded by a series of bracts. The subspecies tephrochlorum is distinguished by its lighter coloration and specific geographic distribution compared to other forms of Hieracium pallescens."
