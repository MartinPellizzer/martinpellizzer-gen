It features compact, upright growth with narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions."
