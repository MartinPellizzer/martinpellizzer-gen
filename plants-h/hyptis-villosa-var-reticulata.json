It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white or silver pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue to violet in color, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators make it both aesthetically pleasing and ecologically valuable."
