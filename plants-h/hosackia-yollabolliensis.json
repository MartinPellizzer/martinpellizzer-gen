    "intro": "Hosackia yollabolliensis, commonly known as the Yollabolli hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of Peru. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy, branched stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to cold, high-altitude conditions. Its leaves are compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hosackia yollabolliensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
