    "intro": "Helminthia echioides proles humifusa, commonly known as the creeping helminthia, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its prostrate habit and small, lance-shaped leaves. It produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant is native to specific regions of Europe and is often found in moist, shaded environments like woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil. Botanically, it is notable for its simple, unbranched stems and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
