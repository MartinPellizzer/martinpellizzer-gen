    "intro": "Horridocactus andicola var. mollensis, commonly known as the Andean night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that are often covered in a layer of white, waxy bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, large, white or pale yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
