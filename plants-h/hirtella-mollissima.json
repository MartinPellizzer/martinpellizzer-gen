    "intro": "Hirtella mollissima, commonly known as the velvet hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage, which gives it its common name. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are clustered in inflorescences and bloom during the wet season. Hirtella mollissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
