    "intro": "Hyalosperma cotula, commonly known as false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in heads, resembling those of true dandelions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hyalosperma cotula is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some agricultural areas."
