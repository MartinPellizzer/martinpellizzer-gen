It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its yellow flowers and smooth, leafless stems. The plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their potential antidepressant effects. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause skin irritation when exposed to sunlight."
