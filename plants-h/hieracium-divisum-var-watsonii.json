    "intro": "Hieracium divisum var. watsonii, commonly known as the Watson's divided hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are deeply lobed and divided, giving it a distinctive, somewhat fern-like appearance. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its role in local pollinator ecosystems."
