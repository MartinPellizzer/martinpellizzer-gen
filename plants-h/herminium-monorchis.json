    "intro": "Herminium monorchis, commonly known as the single-ovary orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and produces a single, elongated flower spike bearing a single, showy orchid flower. The plant typically blooms in late summer, with the flower having a distinctive spurred lip that is often brightly colored. It grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows, and prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The species is notable for its unique floral morphology and is often found in association with specific mycorrhizal fungi."
