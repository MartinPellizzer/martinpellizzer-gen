    "intro": "Hieracium subauricula, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that form a dense cluster near the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
