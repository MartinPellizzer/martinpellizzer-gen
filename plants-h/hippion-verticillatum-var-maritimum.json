    "intro": "Hippion verticillatum var. maritimum, commonly known as the maritime thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a whorled pattern along the stem. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its adaptability to harsh coastal conditions, it plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
