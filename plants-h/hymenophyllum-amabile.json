    "intro": "Hymenophyllum amabile, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, velvety fronds that give it a soft, moss-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and protect against desiccation. Hymenophyllum amabile is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in forest understories."
