    "intro": "Hemestheum thelypteris, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Dryopteridaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bright yellow to gold in color, especially when young. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate forests. Its rhizomes are covered in a dense layer of root hairs, which help in absorbing nutrients from the soil. Hemestheum thelypteris is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
