    "intro": "Helianthemum viscidulum subsp. viscarioides, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically on stems covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are generally elliptical and covered with a waxy, glandular coating that gives it a sticky texture. This subspecies is often found in coastal and inland regions, where it contributes to the local flora's resilience in arid conditions."
