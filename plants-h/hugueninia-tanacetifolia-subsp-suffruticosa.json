    "intro": "Hugueninia tanacetifolia subsp. suffruticosa, commonly known as the shrubby cudweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit. It features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
