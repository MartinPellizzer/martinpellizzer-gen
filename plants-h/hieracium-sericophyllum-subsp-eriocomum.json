    "intro": "Hieracium sericophyllum subsp. eriocomum, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its subsp. eriocomum is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
