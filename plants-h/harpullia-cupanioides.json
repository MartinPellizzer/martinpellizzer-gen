    "intro": "Harpullia cupanioides, commonly known as the white sapphire tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, yellowish fruits. Its rapid growth rate makes it suitable for reforestation and ornamental purposes. The plant is also valued for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to coastal conditions."
