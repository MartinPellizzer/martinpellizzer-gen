    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, compact foliage with dark green, leathery leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early spring, which are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers give way to small, elliptical berries that are red when mature. This variety is well adapted to rocky and sunny environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant."
