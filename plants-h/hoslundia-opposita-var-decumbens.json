It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its stems are prostrate, often rooting at the nodes to form dense mats. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
