    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus subsp. primitivus, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with gray-green, silver-hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to thrive in poor soils and extreme temperatures, making it a resilient component of desert ecosystems."
