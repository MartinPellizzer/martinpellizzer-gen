    "intro": "Hypericum oliganthum f. montanum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
