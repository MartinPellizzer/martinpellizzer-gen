    "intro": "Habenaria strictissima var. odontopetala, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features slender, erect stems that bear lance-shaped leaves, which are typically grass-like in appearance. The plant produces small, greenish or white flowers arranged in a spike, often with a distinctive hooded lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to humid, nutrient-poor soils."
