    "intro": "Holoschoenus vulgaris subvar. albovittatus, commonly known as the white-banded sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green with a distinct white or pale stripe running along the midrib. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy habitats. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland environments."
