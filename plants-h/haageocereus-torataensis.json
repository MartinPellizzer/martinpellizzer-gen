    "intro": "Haageocereus torataensis, commonly known as the Torata night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless cactus with a rounded, segmented stem that stores water efficiently. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in desert gardens."
