    "intro": "Helictotrichon desertorum, commonly known as the desert grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a perennial grass characterized by its low-growing, clump-forming habit and narrow, blue-green blades. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability. Its ability to thrive in such conditions makes it an important component of desert ecosystems."
