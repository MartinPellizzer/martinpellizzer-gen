    "intro": "Hydrocotyle peduncularis var. gracilenta, commonly known as slender water shield, is a aquatic plant characterized by its floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface. The plant has slender, branching stems that support its leaf structure, and it produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss and aids in buoyancy. This variant is distinguished by its more delicate and elongated leaf shape compared to other varieties of Hydrocotyle."
