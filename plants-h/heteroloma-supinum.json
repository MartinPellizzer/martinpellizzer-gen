    "intro": "Heteroloma supinum, commonly known as the creeping coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph that relies on fungal associations for nutrients. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and woodlands. Its flowers are small and white, often arranged in a spike, and it produces a capsule as its fruit. Due to its reliance on specific fungi and habitat conditions, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
