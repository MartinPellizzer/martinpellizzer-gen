    "intro": "Hedyotis purpurea f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered bladdernut, is a variant of the bladdernut species characterized by its pale to white flowers instead of the typical red or purple. It is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Asia, particularly China and Japan, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, facilitating its propagation in suitable habitats. This form is prized in horticulture for its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
