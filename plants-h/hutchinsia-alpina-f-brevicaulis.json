    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina f. brevicaulis, commonly known as the short-stemmed alpine hutchinsia, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pale purple. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is valued in rock gardens and alpine collections for its hardiness and distinctive growth habit. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
