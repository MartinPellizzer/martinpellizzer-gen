    "intro": "Hymenopappus ochroleucus, commonly known as the yellow burweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant produces small yellow flowers that are surrounded by pale, hairy bracts, giving it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The seeds are dispersed by wind, aided by the pappus structures that give the plant its common name."
