It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough, hairy texture. Hordeum michalkowii is of interest to botanists and researchers due to its potential for genetic diversity and ecological resilience."
