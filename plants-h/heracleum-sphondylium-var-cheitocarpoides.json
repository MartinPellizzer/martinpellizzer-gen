    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. cheitocarpoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a biennial plant characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The roots are thick and fleshy, similar to other members of the carrot family, and are typically not edible due to their bitter taste."
