    "intro": "Hyptianthera macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited hyptianthera, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by distinctive, fleshy berries that are red when mature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
