It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dense, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suited for rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
