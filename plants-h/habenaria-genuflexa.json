    "intro": "Habenaria genuflexa, commonly known as the bent-stem orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often curved stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
