    "intro": "Hedyotis leschenaultii var. leschenaultii, commonly known as the Leschenault's inchplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to Southeast Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects."
