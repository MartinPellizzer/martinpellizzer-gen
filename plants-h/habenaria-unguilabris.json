    "intro": "Habenaria unguilabris, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to various regions of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Philippines. It features a slender, creeping rhizome and produces dense clusters of pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose, loose, spiral-like inflorescence. The leaves are linear and grass-like, often forming a rosette near the base of the plant. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and is often found in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its flowering period typically occurs in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle ornamental value to its natural habitat."
