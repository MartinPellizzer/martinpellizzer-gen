    "intro": "Hirculus egregius, commonly known as the celestial horned orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its unique, spiraling inflorescence and vibrant, iridescent petals that shift in color under different light conditions. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-draining soil, often growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded forest clearings. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths and bees. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to climate change, Hirculus egregius is classified as an endangered species."
