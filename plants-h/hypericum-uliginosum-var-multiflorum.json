It features erect, branched stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with prominent orange\u817a\u4f53 (glands) at the base of each petal. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. This species is often found in marshy areas, along stream banks, and in other moist environments where it thrives in full to partial sunlight."
