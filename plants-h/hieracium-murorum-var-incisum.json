    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. incisum, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and often toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
