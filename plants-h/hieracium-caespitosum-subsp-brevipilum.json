    "intro": "Hieracium caespitosum subsp. brevipilum, commonly known as the short-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of narrowly elliptic, dark green leaves with hairy surfaces. Its inflorescence consists of yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with petals that are narrowly ovate. This subspecies is characterized by its short, stiff hairs on the leaves and stems, distinguishing it from other hawkweed species."
