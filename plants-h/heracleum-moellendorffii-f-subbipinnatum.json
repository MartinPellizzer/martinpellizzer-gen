    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii f. subbipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, bipinnate leaves that are narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other members of the genus Heracleum."
