    "intro": "Haplophyllum deserti, commonly known as the desert horkstall, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to dry, hot climates. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces yellowish-green flowers during the spring. Its botanical features include a woody stem and a compact growth form, which aid in its survival in harsh environments. Haplophyllum deserti is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats."
