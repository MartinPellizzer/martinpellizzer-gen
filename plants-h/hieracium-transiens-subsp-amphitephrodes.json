    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. amphitephrodes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its subspecific name, *amphitephrodes*, refers to the presence of both stamens and pistils in the flower heads, a feature that distinguishes it from other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
