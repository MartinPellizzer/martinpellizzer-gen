    "intro": "Huperzia australis, commonly known as the Australian huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. The plant features a creeping rhizome with upright, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hair. Its sporophylls are clustered at the base of the leaves and produce spores in a unique, cup-like structure. Huperzia australis is notable for its primitive morphology and is often used in studies of early land plant evolution."
