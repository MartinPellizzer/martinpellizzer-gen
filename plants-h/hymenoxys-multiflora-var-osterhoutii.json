The plant typically grows in arid environments, such as sandy soils in desert regions, and is adapted to low water conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in xeriscapes due to its drought tolerance and attractive blooms."
