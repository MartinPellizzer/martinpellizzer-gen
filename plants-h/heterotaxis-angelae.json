    "intro": "Heterotaxis angelae, commonly known as the celestial twist, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves and flowers. It belongs to the family Apiaceae and is native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. The plant exhibits a distinctive heterotaxis, where its leaves alternate in a helical pattern around the stem, enhancing its ability to capture sunlight. Its flowers are small, clustered in umbels, and bloom in shades of white and pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Heterotaxis angelae is considered a conservation concern."
