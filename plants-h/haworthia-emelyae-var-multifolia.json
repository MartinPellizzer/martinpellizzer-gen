    "intro": "Haworthia emelyae var. multifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stems with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
