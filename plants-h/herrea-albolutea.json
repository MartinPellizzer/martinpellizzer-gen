    "intro": "Herrea albolutea, commonly known as the white-flowered herrea, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. Herrea albolutea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
