    "intro": "Huperzia quasipolytrichoides var. rectifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern-like moss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright shoots and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often recurved at the tips. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophyte structures are relatively simple, with a short seta and a capsule that produces spores. This variant is notable for its distinct morphology and ecological adaptability in temperate regions."
