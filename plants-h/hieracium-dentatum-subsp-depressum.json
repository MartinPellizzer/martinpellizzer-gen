    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. depressum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
