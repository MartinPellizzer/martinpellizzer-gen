    "intro": "Hiraea fagifolia f. riedleyana, commonly known as the Riedley's hiraea, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Euphorbiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring deeply lobed foliage that resembles the structure of its parent species, H. fagifolia. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, arranged in clusters, and it produces a distinctive, gelatinous fruit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
