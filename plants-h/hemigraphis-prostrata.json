    "intro": "Hemigraphis prostrata, commonly known as shining mignonette, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a velvety texture and a striking coloration that ranges from silver to deep green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense mats, which help suppress weeds and retain soil moisture."
