    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. pseudofastigiatum, commonly known as the shadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, preferring partial to full shade. It has basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and often hairy, with stems that are upright and slightly woolly. The flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, contributing to its ecological role as a nectar source for pollinators."
