It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink with a yellowish center. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It has a short, thick stem with a cluster of lance-shaped leaves at the base. Hemiboea poilanei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
