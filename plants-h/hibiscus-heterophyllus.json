    "intro": "Hibiscus heterophyllus, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, ranging from broad and palmate to narrow and lanceolate, which is a unique adaptation to its native environment. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical and subtropical regions. Hibiscus heterophyllus is also valued for its use in traditional Hawaiian culture and as a source of fiber."
