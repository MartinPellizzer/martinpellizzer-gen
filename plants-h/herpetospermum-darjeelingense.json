    "intro": "Herpetospermum darjeelingense, commonly known as the Darjeeling herbaceous plant, is a rare flowering plant native to the eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high altitudes, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research and conservation efforts."
