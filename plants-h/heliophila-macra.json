    "intro": "Heliophila macra, commonly known as the tall water plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in conditions with ample sunlight. The plant features long, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in aquatic habitats. Heliophila macra is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
