    "intro": "Hydrocotyle densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often surrounded by a spatulate leaf-like structure. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across wetland areas, forming dense mats. Hydrocotyle densiflora is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized structures that help it thrive in shallow water and marshy habitats."
