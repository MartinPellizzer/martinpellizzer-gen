    "intro": "Haplophyllum rosmarinifolium, commonly known as rosemary-leaved haplophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its aromatic, needle-like leaves that resemble those of rosemary, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early summer. Haplophyllum rosmarinifolium is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
