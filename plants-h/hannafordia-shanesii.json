    "intro": "Hannafordia shanesii, commonly known as the Shanes' lily, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, while its flowers are arranged in a dense, spike-like cluster.
