    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 bickhamii, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a flowering plant in the family Cistaceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum sessilifolium. This plant is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. It produces showy yellow flowers in summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
