    "intro": "Hieracium erioneurum, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a mild, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Hieracium erioneurum is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate climates."
