    "intro": "Heracleum \u00d7 carbonnieri, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a hybrid plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. It is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive. Due to its toxic sap, it poses a risk to humans and animals if touched without proper protection."
