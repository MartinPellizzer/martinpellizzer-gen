    "intro": "Hieracium rosaceum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Hieracium rosaceum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed production."
