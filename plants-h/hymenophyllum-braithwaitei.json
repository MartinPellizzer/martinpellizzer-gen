    "intro": "Hymenophyllum braithwaitei, commonly known as the Braithwaite's filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small groups on the underside of the fronds. This species is known for its unique morphology and ecological adaptation to humid, shaded habitats."
