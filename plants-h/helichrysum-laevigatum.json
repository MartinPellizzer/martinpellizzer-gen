    "intro": "Helichrysum laevigatum, commonly known as the smooth everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to produce small, yellowish to golden flowers. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
