    "intro": "Harpullia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined harpullia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are followed by orange-red, fleshy fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions. Harpullia reticulata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
