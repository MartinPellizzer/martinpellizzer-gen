    "intro": "Hieracium polysteganum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
