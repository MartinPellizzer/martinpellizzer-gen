    "intro": "Habenaria chloroleuca var. brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Southeast Asia. It features slender, erect stems with a few leaves that are linear and often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a raceme, which are characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its shorter leaves compared to the typical form of Habenaria chloroleuca."
