    "intro": "Hakea fitzgeraldii, commonly known as Fitzgerald's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical foliage and striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to arid conditions with its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces woody, cone-like structures that contain the seeds, which are dispersed by fire. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitat."
