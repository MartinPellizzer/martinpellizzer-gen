    "intro": "Hemarthria humilis, commonly known as littleleaf grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are characteristic of the grass family. Hemarthria humilis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and wetlands. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
