    "intro": "Hippion nivale, commonly known as the snow gentian, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a short, sturdy stem with lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystem health."
