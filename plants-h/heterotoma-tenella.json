    "intro": "Heterotoma tenella, commonly known as the common sand spider, is a small arachnid belonging to the family Heterotomidae. It is characterized by its slender body and long, delicate legs, which are adapted for life in sandy environments. The plant-like appearance of its web-like structures has led to some confusion with botanical forms, though it is not a plant. Its habitat includes arid and semi-arid regions where it constructs silk-lined burrows. Despite its name, Heterotoma tenella plays a role in soil aeration and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
