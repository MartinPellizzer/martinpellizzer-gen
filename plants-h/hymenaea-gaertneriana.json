    "intro": "Hymenaea gaertneriana, commonly known as the yellow cedar or Brazilian cedar, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree produces large, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in branched inflorescences. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a velvety texture. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release its seeds, contributing to its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
