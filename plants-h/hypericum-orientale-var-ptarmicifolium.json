    "intro": "Hypericum orientale var. ptarmicifolium, commonly known as the Eastern St. John's Wort, is a variant of the St. John's Wort genus native to parts of Asia and Europe. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. This variety is also notable for its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in herbal medicine."
