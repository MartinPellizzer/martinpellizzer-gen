It is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia, particularly in parts of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically yellowish-green in color, and it produces woody fruits that contain one or two seeds. Hopea samarensis is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making, and it plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
