    "intro": "Hakea acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that appear in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea acuminata is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
