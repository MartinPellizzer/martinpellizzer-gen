    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum var. vogesicola, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rigid and covered with fine hairs, and the flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
