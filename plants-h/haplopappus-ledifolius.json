    "intro": "Haplopappus ledifolius, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with basal rosettes of gray-green, woolly leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture in arid environments. Haplopappus ledifolius is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems."
