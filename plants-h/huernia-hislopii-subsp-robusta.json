It features thick, fleshy stems that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal watering, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for cactus and succulent collections."
