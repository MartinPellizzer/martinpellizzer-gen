    "intro": "Haplodictyum canescens, commonly known as the gray feather grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. Haplodictyum canescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
