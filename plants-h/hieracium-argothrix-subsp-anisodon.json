    "intro": "Hieracium argothrix subsp. anisodon, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense cushions to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant has finely divided, silver-green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
