    "intro": "Hedypnois coronopifolia, commonly known as the crown fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to moist soil or rocky surfaces. The leaves are usually bi- or tri-pinnate, giving the plant a lacy appearance."
