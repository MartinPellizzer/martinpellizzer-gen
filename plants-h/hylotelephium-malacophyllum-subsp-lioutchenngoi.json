    "intro": "Hylotelephium malacophyllum subsp. lioutchenngoi, commonly known as the Tibetan stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to high-altitude regions of China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine meadows. It produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or red, which bloom in late summer. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and full sun."
