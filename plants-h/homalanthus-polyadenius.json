    "intro": "Homalanthus polyadenius, commonly known as the hairy false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant features palmate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
