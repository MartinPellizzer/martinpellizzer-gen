    "intro": "Heteropterys nervosa, commonly known as the veined mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the Lythraceae family. It typically grows on the branches of host trees, such as those in the genus *Celtis*, and derives some of its nutrients through specialized roots called haustoria. The plant has small, opposite leaves with prominent veins, and its flowers are usually greenish-white with five petals. It produces small, fleshy fruits that are dispersed by birds. Heteropterys nervosa is native to tropical regions of Central and South America."
