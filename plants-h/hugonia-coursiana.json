    "intro": "Hugonia coursiana, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and riparian zones in the southeastern United States. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems. Hugonia coursiana plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
