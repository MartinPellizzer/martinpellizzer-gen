    "intro": "Hakea nodosa, commonly known as the smooth hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or club-shaped inflorescences that bear small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces woody, spine-like fruits that contain seeds. Hakea nodosa is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife."
