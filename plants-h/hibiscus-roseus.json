    "intro": "Hibiscus roseus, commonly known as the Hawaiian hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from red to pink and white, often with a prominent central pistil. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch and are typically a deep green. Hibiscus roseus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
