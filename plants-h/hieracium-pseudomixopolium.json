    "intro": "Hieracium pseudomixopolium, commonly known as the false mixopolitan hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and colonize new areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
