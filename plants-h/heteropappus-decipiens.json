It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and branched. Its flowers are yellow and are followed by fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds.
