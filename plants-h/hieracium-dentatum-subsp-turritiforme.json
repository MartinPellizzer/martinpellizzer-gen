    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. turritiforme, commonly known as the Turritiform hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in grassy areas and open woodlands. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and often branched. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, turban-like shape of the flower head, which gives it its common name."
