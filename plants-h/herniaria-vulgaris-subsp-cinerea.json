    "intro": "Herniaria vulgaris subsp. cinerea, commonly known as grey horned vetch, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery-white hairs, giving the plant a greyish appearance. The flowers are small, pinkish-white, and borne in clusters, adding a delicate ornamental quality. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes. This subspecies is notable for its ability to stabilize soil and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
