It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 40 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowering stems bear clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. Its inflorescence consists of numerous small florets arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
