It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium viveliense is often found in disturbed habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain areas."
