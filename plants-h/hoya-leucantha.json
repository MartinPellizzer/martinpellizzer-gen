    "intro": "Hoya leucantha, commonly known as the white-veined wax plant, is a tropical vine belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can have a striking white or cream veining. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya leucantha is native to Southeast Asia and thrives in warm, humid environments with bright, indirect light. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
