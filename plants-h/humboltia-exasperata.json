    "intro": "Humboltia exasperata, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Humboltia exasperata is well adapted to survive in harsh, low-water environments, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
