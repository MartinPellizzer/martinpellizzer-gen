    "intro": "Herniaria erckertii subsp. pulvinata, commonly known as the pulvinate herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or dry habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
