    "intro": "Hydrophyllum virginianum, commonly known as Virginia waterleaf, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble water lilies, often with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to wetland restoration projects."
