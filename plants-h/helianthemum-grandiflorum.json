    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters, with woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of showy yellow or orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, oval, and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Helianthemum grandiflorum is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it adapts well to harsh environmental conditions."
