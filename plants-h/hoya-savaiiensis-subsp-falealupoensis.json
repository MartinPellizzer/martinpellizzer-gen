    "intro": "Hoya savaiiensis subsp. falealupoensis, commonly known as the Falealupo Hoya, is a rare flowering plant native to Samoa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable and sought-after species among hoya enthusiasts."
