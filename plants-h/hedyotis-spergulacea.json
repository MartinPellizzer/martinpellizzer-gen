    "intro": "Hedyotis spergulacea, commonly known as creeping marsh woundwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marshy environments. It features small, opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in moist habitats. Hedyotis spergulacea is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
