    "intro": "Hieracium squamulare, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense patches. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in some regions."
