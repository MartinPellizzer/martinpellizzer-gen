    "intro": "Hevea benthamiana f. obtusiloba, commonly known as the obtuse-leaf rubber tree, is a botanical variant of the rubber tree species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its broad, obtuse leaves that differ from the typical elongated leaves of the main species. This form is often cultivated for its latex production, similar to the parent species, but exhibits distinct morphological features. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained, fertile soil. Its botanical study is important for understanding genetic diversity and potential applications in rubber production."
