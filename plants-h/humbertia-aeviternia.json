    "intro": "Humbertia aeviternia, commonly known as the eternal humbertia, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the misty highlands of the fictional continent of Virelia. Its botanical features include thick, waxy leaves that shimmer with a bioluminescent glow at night, a trait believed to aid in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet and blue, which bloom only during the lunar eclipse. Its root system is unusually deep, allowing it to access water from underground aquifers. Due to its unique adaptations, Humbertia aeviternia is considered a keystone species in its ecosystem, supporting a diverse array of flora and fauna."
