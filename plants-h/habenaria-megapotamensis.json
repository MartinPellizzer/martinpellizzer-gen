    "intro": "Habenaria megapotamensis, commonly known as the Amazonian twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as tropical rainforests, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the forest floor, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
