It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
