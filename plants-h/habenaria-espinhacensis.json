    "intro": "Habenaria espinhacensis, commonly known as the Espinhacense orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a single, erect flower spike with a distinctive lip. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
