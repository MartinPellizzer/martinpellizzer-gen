    "intro": "Helia, commonly known as the sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers and a central dark brown disk. It is native to North America but has been widely cultivated around the world for its ornamental value and oil production. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with upright stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers follow the sun's movement, a phenomenon known as heliotropism, which enhances its ability to attract pollinators. The seeds, often referred to as sunflower seeds, are rich in nutrients and are commonly consumed as snacks or used in cooking."
