    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. basalticum, commonly known as the basalt hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on slopes and among scree. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct ecological and morphological adaptations to its harsh environment. It is relatively uncommon and is of interest to botanists due to its specialized habitat requirements."
