    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive, undulating stems that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has opposite, linear leaves. It produces small, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is often used in herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
