It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its tiny, willow-like leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal or riverine habitats. It has a compact growth habit, with stems that are usually less than 10 centimeters in height. Haloragis minima is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and periodic inundation."
