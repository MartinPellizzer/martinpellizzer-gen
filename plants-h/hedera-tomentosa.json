    "intro": "Hedera tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera tomentosa is relatively low-maintenance and can be grown in containers or as a ground cover in suitable climates."
