    "intro": "Hyssopus pubescens, commonly known as woolly hyssop, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its square, hairy stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive grayish-blue hue. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Hyssopus pubescens is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
