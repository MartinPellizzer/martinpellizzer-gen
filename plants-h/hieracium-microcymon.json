    "intro": "Hieracium microcymon, commonly known as the small-cyme hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically has basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its small size and inconspicuous appearance, it is sometimes overlooked despite its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
