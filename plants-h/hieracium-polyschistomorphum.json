It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed, and the flowers are yellow, forming a flat-topped inflorescence.
