    "intro": "Heeria pallida, commonly known as the pale heeria, is a low-growing shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, adding a subtle visual contrast to its foliage. Heeria pallida is adapted to sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its resilience to drought and heat makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping in dry landscapes."
