    "intro": "Hoorebekia racemosa, commonly known as the yellow marsh willow, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features slender, willow-like stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense colonies. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, drooping flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Hoorebekia racemosa thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along stream banks."
