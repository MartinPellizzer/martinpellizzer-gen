It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white, clustered flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in moist soil and is often found along stream banks and in swampy areas. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels.
