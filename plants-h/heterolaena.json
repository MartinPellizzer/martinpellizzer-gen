    "intro": "Heterolaena, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that are often pink or red in color. Heterolaena species are typically found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal or inland areas with high rainfall. Some species are valued for their hard, durable wood, which has been used historically for construction and tool-making."
