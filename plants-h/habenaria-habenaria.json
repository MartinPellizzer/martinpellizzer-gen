    "intro": "Habenaria habenaria, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often in shaded areas near water sources. Its roots are often found in symbiotic relationships with specific fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native ecosystems."
