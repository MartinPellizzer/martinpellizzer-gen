    "intro": "Hypericum hypericoides, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs. It contains hypericin and other compounds that have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
