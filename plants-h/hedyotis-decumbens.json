    "intro": "Hedyotis decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate marsh mallow, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to moist, temperate regions. It features small, opposite leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are borne on short, slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms dense mats in wetland or streamside habitats. Hedyotis decumbens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in aquatic environments."
