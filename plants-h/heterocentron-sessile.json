    "intro": "Heterocentron sessile, commonly known as the sessile hornwort, is a type of aquatic plant belonging to the order Marchantiopsida. It is a liverwort that typically grows in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has a thallus that is segmented into nodes, with leaves arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. Its reproductive structures, including archegonia and antheridia, are located on separate shoots, which is a characteristic feature of its reproductive biology. Heterocentron sessile plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and contributing to water filtration."
