    "intro": "Heliotropium humile, commonly known as the small heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Nyctaginaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss. Heliotropium humile is also noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
