    "intro": "Hieracium vestitum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium vestitum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
