    "intro": "Heteropterys heterocarpa, commonly known as the yellow bell, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
