    "intro": "Hybanthus procumbens, commonly known as the creeping hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically spreads along the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, often clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hybanthus procumbens is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks."
