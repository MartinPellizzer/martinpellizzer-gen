    "intro": "Hypoestes menthifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf strobilanthes, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, velvety leaves that range in color from silver to deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes menthifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique leaf patterns and compact growth habit."
