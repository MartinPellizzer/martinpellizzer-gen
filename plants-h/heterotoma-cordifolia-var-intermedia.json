    "intro": "Heterotoma cordifolia var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate heartleaf, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically glossy and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or shaded areas. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological variation and ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
