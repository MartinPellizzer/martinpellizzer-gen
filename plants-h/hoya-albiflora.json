    "intro": "Hoya albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered waxplant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya albiflora is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
