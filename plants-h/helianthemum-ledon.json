    "intro": "Helianthemum ledon, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, rounded foliage composed of small, leathery, gray-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Helianthemum ledon is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and ornamental value."
