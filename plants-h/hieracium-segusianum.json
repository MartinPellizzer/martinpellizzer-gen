    "intro": "Hieracium segusianum, commonly known as the Segusian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and it has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes. Hieracium segusianum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly and outcompete native vegetation."
