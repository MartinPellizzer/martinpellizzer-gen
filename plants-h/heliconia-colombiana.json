    "intro": "Heliconia colombiana, commonly known as the Colombian heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Heliconia colombiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
