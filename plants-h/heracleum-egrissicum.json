    "intro": "Heracleum egrissicum, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbels. The plant is characterized by its thick, hollow stems covered with purple spots and coarse hairs. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
