    "intro": "Heteronoma, commonly known as the \"false nettle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Urticaceae. These plants are characterized by their opposite leaf arrangement and the presence of stinging hairs, similar to true nettles. They typically grow in moist, temperate regions and are often found in woodland or swampy areas. Heteronoma species are herbaceous, with some varieties being climbing or shrub-like. The flowers are small and clustered, often green or yellowish in color, and they produce small, dry fruits."
