It features delicate, silver-tipped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact and ornamental appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its low-growing habit and unique foliage make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a subtle, hardy addition to their landscape."
