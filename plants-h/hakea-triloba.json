    "intro": "Hakea triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea triloba is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy plant for dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and ecological significance make it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts."
