    "intro": "Habenaria blephariglottis var. integrilabia, commonly known as the broad-lipped marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features a slender, erect stem with few leaves and produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its flowers have a distinctive broad, lip-like structure that sets it apart from other orchid species. The variety is characterized by its more robust and evenly shaped labellum compared to the typical form."
