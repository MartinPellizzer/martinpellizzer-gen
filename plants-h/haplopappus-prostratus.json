    "intro": "Haplopappus prostratus, commonly known as the prostrate pappus, is a low-growing flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that lie close to the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, followed by small, woolly bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Haplopappus prostratus is a hardy species well adapted to harsh, dry conditions."
