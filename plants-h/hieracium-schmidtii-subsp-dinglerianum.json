    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. dinglerianum, commonly known as the Dingler's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
