    "intro": "Halerpestes cymbalaria f. hebecaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spurge, is a variant of the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellowish-green cyathia, which are the modified floral structures typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This form is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Halerpestes cymbalaria."
