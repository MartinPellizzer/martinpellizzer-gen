It is characterized by its dark purple to black flower heads, which are surrounded by yellow ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and basal leaves. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread across various habitats."
