It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Argentina and Chile. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
