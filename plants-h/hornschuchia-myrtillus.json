    "intro": "Hornschuchia myrtillus, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Hornschuchia myrtillus is often found in tundra and alpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small animals."
