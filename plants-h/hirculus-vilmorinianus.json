    "intro": "Hirculus vilmorinianus, commonly known as the Vilmorin's goat plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves that give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
