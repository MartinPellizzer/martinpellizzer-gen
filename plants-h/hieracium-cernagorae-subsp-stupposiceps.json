    "intro": "Hieracium cernagorae subsp. stupposiceps, commonly known as the Stupposiceps hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leaf structures. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology, including a prominent, elongated central disk surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. It typically grows in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
