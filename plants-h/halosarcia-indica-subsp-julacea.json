    "intro": "Halosarcia indica subsp. julacea, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and showy blue or violet flowers. The plant has small, palmately lobed leaves and produces pods that contain lens-shaped seeds. It is native to coastal regions of southern Africa and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. Due to its salt tolerance, it is often found in dunes and other coastal habitats where other plants struggle to survive."
