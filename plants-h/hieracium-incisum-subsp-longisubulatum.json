    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. longisubulatum, commonly known as the long-bristled hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are often covered in glandular trichomes. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its distinct bristly appearance and is often found in temperate climates."
