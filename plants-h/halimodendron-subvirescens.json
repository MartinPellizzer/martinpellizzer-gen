    "intro": "Halimodendron subvirescens, commonly known as the desert broom. It is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa. The plant has small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh environment. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it resilient in drought conditions."
