    "intro": "Hieracium psammogeniceps, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to sandy coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils, often found on dunes and disturbed sites. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Hieracium psammogeniceps is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
