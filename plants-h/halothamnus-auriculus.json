    "intro": "Halothamnus auriculus, commonly known as the auricled sandthrift, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland deserts. Due to its drought tolerance and ability to stabilize soil, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
