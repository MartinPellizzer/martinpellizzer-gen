    "intro": "Hyalopoa jurtzevii, commonly known as the Jurtzev's hyalopoa, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small, white to pale yellow, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
