    "intro": "Hyalolaena severzovii, commonly known as the Severzov's hyalolaena, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, often branched stems and small, delicate leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. It is adapted to grow in specific, often arid or rocky habitats, which contribute to its limited distribution. Due to its restricted range and specific ecological requirements, Hyalolaena severzovii is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
