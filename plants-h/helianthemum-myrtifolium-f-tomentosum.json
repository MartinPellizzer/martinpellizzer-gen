    "intro": "Helianthemum myrtifolium f. tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
