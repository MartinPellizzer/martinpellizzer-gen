    "intro": "Hieracium macrodontoides subsp. gigantophyllum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, with a rough texture. It thrives in rocky or alpine habitats and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
