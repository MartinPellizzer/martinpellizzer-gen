    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a tall biennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, aromatic stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, making it a plant to handle with care."
