    "intro": "Hedera dentata, commonly known as the serrated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera dentata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along stone walls. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, decorative plant."
