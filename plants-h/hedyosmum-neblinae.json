    "intro": "Hedyosmum neblinae, commonly known as the cloud forest hedyosmum, is a flowering plant native to the humid highlands of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typical of cloud forest ecosystems. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine by local communities. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
