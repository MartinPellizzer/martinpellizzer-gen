    "intro": "Helichrysum litoreum, commonly known as sea daisies, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in dense, daisy-like clusters. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in coastal environments. Helichrysum litoreum is also known for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
