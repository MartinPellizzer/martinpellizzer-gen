    "intro": "Homeria collina, commonly known as the coastal homeria, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Homeria collina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging coastal environments."
