    "intro": "Hygrophila portoricensis, commonly known as the Puerto Rican hygrophila, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Puerto Rico. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater bodies. The plant features lance-shaped leaves and produces spikes of small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or red in color. It is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
