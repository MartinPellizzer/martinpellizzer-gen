    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ability to thrive in moist soils and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
