    "intro": "Helianthemum alpestre var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the alpine rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
