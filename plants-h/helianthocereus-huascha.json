    "intro": "Helianthocereus huascha, commonly known as the Huascha cactus, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent nature allows it to store water efficiently, adapting to arid environments. The fruit that follows the flowers is a small, edible berry with a sweet, tangy flavor."
