    "intro": "Hieracium lycodontum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium lycodontum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
