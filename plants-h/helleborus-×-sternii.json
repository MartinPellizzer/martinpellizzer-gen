It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, resembling roses. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped blooms in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Helleborus \u00d7 sternii is also valued for its ability to bloom reliably in colder climates."
