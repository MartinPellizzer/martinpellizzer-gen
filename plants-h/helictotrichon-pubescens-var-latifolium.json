    "intro": "Helictotrichon pubescens var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in native plant gardens."
