    "intro": "Hedysarum sulphurescens, commonly known as the sulfur yellow peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
