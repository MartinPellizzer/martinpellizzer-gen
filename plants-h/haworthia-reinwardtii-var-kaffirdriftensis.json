    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii var. kaffirdriftensis, commonly known as the Kaffir drift haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white to light green markings. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Haworthia reinwardtii, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces tall, branched flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its compact size and ornamental appeal."
