    "intro": "Hapalochilus novae-hiberniae, commonly known as the New Ireland orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to the island of New Ireland in the Bismarck Archipelago. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical environments, often in shaded forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, moist soil of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
