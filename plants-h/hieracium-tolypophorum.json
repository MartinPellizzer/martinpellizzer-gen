    "intro": "Hieracium tolypophorum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture and often have a reddish or purple underside. Hieracium tolypophorum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
