It features compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its pods contain small, flat seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum glabrifoliolatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
