    "intro": "Helenium autumnale var. longifolium, commonly known as the swamp helenium, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features tall, spire-like inflorescences composed of bright orange to red ray flowers and yellow disc florets. The plant has lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in moist, swampy habitats and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its showy flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
