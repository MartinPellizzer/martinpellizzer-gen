    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirtellum var. gratum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and hairy fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
