    "intro": "Himantoglossum calcaratum subsp. jankae, commonly known as the Janka's horned orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated flowers with a prominent central spur, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. The plant typically grows in calcareous grasslands and rocky habitats, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine, hairy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this subspecies is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
