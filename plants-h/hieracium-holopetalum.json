    "intro": "Hieracium holopetalum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
