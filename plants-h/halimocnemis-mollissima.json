It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which are surrounded by soft, hairy leaves. Halimocnemis mollissima is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh environments. Its silky foliage and unique floral structure make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
