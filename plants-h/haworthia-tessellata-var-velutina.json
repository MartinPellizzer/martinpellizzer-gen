    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata var. velutina, commonly known as the velvet haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves covered in a fine, velvety coating, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically adorned with white to pale blue markings, creating a striking visual contrast. It produces small, bell-shaped white or greenish flowers on tall, slender stalks during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
