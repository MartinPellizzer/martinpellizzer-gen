It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
