It is native to Central and South America, particularly found in regions with warm, tropical climates. The plant produces striking, night-blooming flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Its fruit, which is the most commercially valuable part, is characterized by its vibrant pink or yellow skin and white, sweet flesh with small, crunchy seeds.
