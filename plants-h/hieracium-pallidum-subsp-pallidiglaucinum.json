It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its flowers are small, yellowish, and borne in a single head, often with pale green or yellowish ray florets. The species is characterized by its pale greenish-blue coloration on the leaves and stems, which gives it its common name."
