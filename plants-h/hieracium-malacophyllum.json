It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a dark center. The plant's name refers to its dark, almost black, root system, which is a distinguishing feature."
