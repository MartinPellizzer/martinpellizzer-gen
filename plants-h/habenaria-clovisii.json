    "intro": "Habenaria clovisii, commonly known as the Clovis orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
