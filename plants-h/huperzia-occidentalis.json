    "intro": "Huperzia occidentalis, commonly known as the western clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems that bear whorls of spirally arranged leaves. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in small, cone-like formations at the base of the leaves. Huperzia occidentalis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
