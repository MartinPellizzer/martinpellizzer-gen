It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single, showy flower with a distinctive lip that resembles a butterfly wing. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, preferring well-drained soils and partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, pale pink to white petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
