    "intro": "Hieracium humile subsp. humile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 cm and features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
