    "intro": "Helictotrichon versicolor subsp. praetutiana, commonly known as the alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and its ability to thrive in high-altitude environments with poor soil conditions. The plant produces small, blue-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ecological significance and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in specialized gardens or conservation areas."
