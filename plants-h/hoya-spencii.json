    "intro": "Hoya spencii, commonly known as the Spence's wax plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya spencii is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its relatively low maintenance requirements. It is also known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
