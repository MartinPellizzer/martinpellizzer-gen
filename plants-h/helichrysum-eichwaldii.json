    "intro": "Helichrysum eichwaldii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, papery flowers that remain intact even when dried, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its foliage is often gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum eichwaldii is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of natural dyes."
