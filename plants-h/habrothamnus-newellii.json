    "intro": "Habrothamnus newellii, commonly known as Newell's habrothamnus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as rocky soils and open plains, where it has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
