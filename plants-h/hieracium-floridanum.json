    "intro": "Hieracium floridanum, commonly known as Florida hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and disturbed soils. It produces yellow to orange flowers with ray florets and is often found in areas with high humidity. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
