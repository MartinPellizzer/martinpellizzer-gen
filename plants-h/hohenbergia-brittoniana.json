    "intro": "Hohenbergia brittoniana, commonly known as the Britton's hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage that forms a dense, water-holding cup. The plant produces striking, long-lasting inflorescences with vibrant red and orange bracts that bloom in the late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia brittoniana is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
