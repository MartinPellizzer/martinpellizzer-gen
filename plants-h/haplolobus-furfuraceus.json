    "intro": "Haplolobus furfuraceus, commonly known as the hairy lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits a unique combination of fungal and algal components. It belongs to the family Lecanoraceae and is characterized by its dense, hairy growth form, which gives it its common name. The plant's thallus is typically crustose or foliose, with a rough, uneven surface covered in short, branched hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on bark or soil surfaces in temperate regions. The lichen's symbiotic relationship between the fungus and algae allows it to efficiently absorb nutrients and water from its surroundings."
