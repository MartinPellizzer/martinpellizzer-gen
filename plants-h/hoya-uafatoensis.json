    "intro": "Hoya uafatoensis, commonly known as the Taveuni hoya, is a rare epiphytic plant native to the island of Taveuni in Fiji. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant produces showy, fragrant blooms in shades of white and pink, which appear during the warmer months. Hoya uafatoensis thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
