    "intro": "Heterolamium debile var. cardiophyllum, commonly known as the heartleaf heterolamium, is a rare and delicate herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical or subtropical climates. Due to its limited distribution and fragility, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
