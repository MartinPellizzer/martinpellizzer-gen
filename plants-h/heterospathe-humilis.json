    "intro": "Heterospathe humilis, commonly known as the lowland marsh fern, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as marshes and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in wet soil, while its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its fronds. Heterospathe humilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
