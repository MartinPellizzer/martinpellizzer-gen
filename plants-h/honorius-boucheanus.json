    "intro": "Honorius boucheanus, commonly known as the Bouch\u00e9's cycad, is a species of cycad native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
