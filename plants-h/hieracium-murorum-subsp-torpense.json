It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to dry conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower coloration. It is often found in open habitats and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
