    "intro": "Holosteum repens, commonly known as the creeping holosteum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that help it thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp that splits into two one-seeded units upon maturity. Holosteum repens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
