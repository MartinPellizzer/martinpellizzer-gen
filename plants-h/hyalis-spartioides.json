    "intro": "Hyalis spartioides, commonly known as the rock hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white during the spring. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to arid conditions. Hyalis spartioides is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
