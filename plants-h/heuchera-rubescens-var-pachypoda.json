    "intro": "Heuchera rubescens var. pachypoda, commonly known as the red-stemmed heuchera, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep red or bronze color. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and ability to provide color in shady areas."
