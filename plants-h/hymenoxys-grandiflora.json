    "intro": "Hymenoxys grandiflora, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hymenoxys grandiflora thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping in arid regions. Its rapid growth and ability to reseed itself contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
