    "intro": "Hydrocotyle humifusa, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via runners make it an effective colonizer of wetland habitats."
