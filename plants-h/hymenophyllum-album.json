    "intro": "Hymenophyllum album, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum album is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
