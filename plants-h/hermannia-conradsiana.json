    "intro": "Hermannia conradsiana, commonly known as the red-eyed cycad, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces large, showy cones, with the female cones being particularly striking due to their bright red color. Hermannia conradsiana is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
