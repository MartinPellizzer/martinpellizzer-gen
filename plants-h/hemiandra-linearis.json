    "intro": "Hemiandra linearis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemiandra, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of eastern Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. It typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Hemiandra linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
