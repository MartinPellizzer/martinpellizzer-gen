    "intro": "Haloragis platycarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited willow-herb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often found in riverine areas and seasonally flooded sites. The plant has slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in dense clusters and bloom during the summer months. The leaves are alternate, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its adaptability in wetland environments."
