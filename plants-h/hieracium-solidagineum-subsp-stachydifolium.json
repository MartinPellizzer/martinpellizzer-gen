    "intro": "Hieracium solidagineum subsp. stachydifolium, commonly known as the sticky leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, often sticky leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
