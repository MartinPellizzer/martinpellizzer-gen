    "intro": "Helianthus rigidus, commonly known as stiff sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are covered in stiff, bristly hairs. The plant produces large, yellow, daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a rough, sandpapery texture. Helianthus rigidus is adapted to moist to wet soils and is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and marshes."
