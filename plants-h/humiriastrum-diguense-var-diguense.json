    "intro": "Humiriastrum diguense var. diguense, commonly known as the desert star, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
