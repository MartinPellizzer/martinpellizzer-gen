    "intro": "Hymenophyllum nephrophyllum, commonly known as the kidney-leaf maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as rock crevices or on tree trunks, and is native to regions of Southeast Asia. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are borne on the underside of the leaves and are clustered in small, round groups. This fern is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in humid, tropical or subtropical climates."
