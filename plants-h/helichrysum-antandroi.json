It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble small torches. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, often found in rocky or mountainous regions. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a velvety texture, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Helichrysum antandroi is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
