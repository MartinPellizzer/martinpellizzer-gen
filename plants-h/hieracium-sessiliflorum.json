    "intro": "Hieracium sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessileflower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal and stem leaves that are usually lanceolate and hairy. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
