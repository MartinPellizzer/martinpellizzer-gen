    "intro": "Hieracium subrosulatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium subrosulatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
