    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 illegitimum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has variable leaf shapes, ranging from lanceolate to oblanceolate, and produces small, elongated achenes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a noxious weed in certain regions."
