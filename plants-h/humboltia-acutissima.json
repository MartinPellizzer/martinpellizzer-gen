    "intro": "Humboltia acutissima, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring narrow, gray-green leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is adapted to hot, dry climates and has a deep root system to access water from deeper soil layers. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, hard seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. Humboltia acutissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
