    "intro": "Haworthia obtusa var. pilifera, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with white or silver markings. The leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its characteristic \"woolly\" appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation."
