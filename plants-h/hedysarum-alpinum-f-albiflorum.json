    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum f. albiflorum, commonly known as the alpine vetch with white flowers, is a rare and striking variant of the alpine vetch. It is a perennial legume native to high-altitude regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant features slender, trailing stems and small, trifoliate leaves. Its most distinguishing characteristic is the presence of white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. This form is notable for its ornamental value and its ecological role in stabilizing alpine soils."
