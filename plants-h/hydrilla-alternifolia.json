    "intro": "Hydrilla alternifolia, commonly known as the alternate-leaf hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has long, slender stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often forming dense underwater mats. The leaves are alternate, narrow, and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, elongated fruits. This plant is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of water conditions, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
