It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky slopes. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the poor soil conditions of its habitat. The species is noted for its small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months of the year."
