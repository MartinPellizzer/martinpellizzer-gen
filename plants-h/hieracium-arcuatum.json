    "intro": "Hieracium arcuatum, commonly known as the bent yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are upright and sometimes hairy. Hieracium arcuatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
