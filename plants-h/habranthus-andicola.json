    "intro": "Habranthus andicola, commonly known as the Andean starflower, is a flowering plant native to the high Andes of South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
