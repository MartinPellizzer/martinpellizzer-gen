    "intro": "Hakea berryana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, bottle-shaped stems that store water, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, followed by woody, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Hakea berryana thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dunes. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it a notable species in the region's flora."
