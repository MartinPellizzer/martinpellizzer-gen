    "intro": "Hieracium proliferum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. Hieracium proliferum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
