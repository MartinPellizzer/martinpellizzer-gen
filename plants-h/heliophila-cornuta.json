    "intro": "Heliophila cornuta, commonly known as the horned heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-shaped bracts that enclose the small, white or pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and has narrow, grass-like leaves. It blooms from June to August, producing clusters of tiny flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila cornuta is often found in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in areas with full sun exposure."
