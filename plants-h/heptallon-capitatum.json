    "intro": "Heptallon capitatum, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heptallon capitatum is often found in open habitats such as cliffs and slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
