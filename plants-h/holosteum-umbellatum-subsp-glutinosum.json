    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum subsp. glutinosum, commonly known as the sticky false bellflower, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a sticky resinous substance, which is a distinctive botanical feature. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and rocky areas."
