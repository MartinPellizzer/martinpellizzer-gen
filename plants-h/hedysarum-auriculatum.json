    "intro": "Hedysarum auriculatum, commonly known as the auriculate milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves with leaflets that have ear-shaped tips, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Hedysarum auriculatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it ecologically significant in nutrient-poor environments."
