    "intro": "Habenaria cornutella, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, with a distinctive horn-like projection on the lip of each bloom. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
