    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum var. subnivale, commonly known as the snow-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, woolly leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soils. Its subnivale variety specifically refers to its association with snow-covered habitats, where it persists under the snow cover. This plant plays a role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
