    "intro": "Hieracium britannicum var. ovale, commonly known as the British dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces a single, tall, hollow stem that bears a bright yellow flower head composed of many small, radiating florets. After flowering, it develops a distinctive, spherical seed head with parachute-like seeds for wind dispersal. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, waste areas, and along roadsides."
