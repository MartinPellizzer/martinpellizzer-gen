    "intro": "Heeria pwetoensis var. subreticulata, commonly known as the Pweto heeria, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of eastern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and elliptical leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane forests. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, reticulate pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
