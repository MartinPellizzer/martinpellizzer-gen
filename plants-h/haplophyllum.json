    "intro": "Haplophyllum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. It consists of several species that are typically found in rocky or coastal habitats, particularly in the Mediterranean region. The plants are characterized by their simple, often succulent leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from pink to white. Haplophyllum species are generally low-growing shrubs, adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Their botanical features make them well-suited for xerophytic environments and they are often used in rock gardens or as ornamental plants."
