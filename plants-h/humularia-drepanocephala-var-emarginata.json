    "intro": "Humularia drepanocephala var. emarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed humularia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of South America. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that have a distinctive notched or emarginate base, giving it its botanical variant name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid tropical or subtropical woodlands. Its foliage is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies primarily in its morphological characteristics and ecological niche."
