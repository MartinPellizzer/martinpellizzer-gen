    "intro": "Hydrangea luteovenosa f. yakushimensis, commonly known as the Yakushimense hydrangea, is a rare and ornamental plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its striking yellow veins on light green leaves, which contrast beautifully with its large, showy white or pink flower clusters. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and floral display make it a sought-after specimen in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
