    "intro": "Hieracium lividum f. falcidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a hairy stem and leaves, which help to reduce water loss in its habitat. The species is a common weed in agricultural areas and is known for its ability to spread rapidly."
