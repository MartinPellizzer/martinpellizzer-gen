    "intro": "Hypolepis stolonifera, commonly known as the running shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive shield-shaped appearance, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ability to propagate through rhizomes makes it a resilient and adaptable species in its native habitat."
