    "intro": "Hakea boucheana, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and salt-tolerant nature make it well-suited for coastal habitats. Hakea boucheana is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and aesthetic appeal in sandy soils."
