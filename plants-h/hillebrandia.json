    "intro": "Hillebrandia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hillebrandia species typically have long, slender roots and possess striking, showy flowers with a unique structure that resembles a ghostly face. The plant is highly sensitive to environmental changes, making it a challenging species to cultivate. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its status as a symbol of tropical biodiversity."
