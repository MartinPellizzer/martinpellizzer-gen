    "intro": "Hieracium pseudextracticeps, commonly known as the false spear thistle, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant produces small, bract-like structures around its flower heads. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other sunny areas where it can spread through both seeds and vegetative growth."
