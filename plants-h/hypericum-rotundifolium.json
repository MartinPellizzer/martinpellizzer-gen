It is characterized by its opposite, rounded leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains hypericin and hyperforin, which are responsible for its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its historical use in herbal medicine dates back to indigenous peoples and early European settlers."
