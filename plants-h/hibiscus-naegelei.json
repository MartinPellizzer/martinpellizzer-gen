    "intro": "Hibiscus naegelei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow throat. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus naegelei is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
