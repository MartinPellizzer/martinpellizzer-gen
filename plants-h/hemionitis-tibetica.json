    "intro": "Hemionitis tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hemionitis, is a rare fern species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the extreme conditions of its alpine habitat. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and fragile ecosystem, Hemionitis tibetica is considered a vulnerable species."
