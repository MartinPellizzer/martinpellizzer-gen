    "intro": "Horkelia pinetorum, commonly known as the mountain flax, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, often in pine forests. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Horkelia pinetorum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
