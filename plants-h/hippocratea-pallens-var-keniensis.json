    "intro": "Hippocratea pallens var. keniensis, commonly known as the Kenyan orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to Kenya. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic, often found in moist, shaded forest environments. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it thrives in high-altitude regions with cool temperatures. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
