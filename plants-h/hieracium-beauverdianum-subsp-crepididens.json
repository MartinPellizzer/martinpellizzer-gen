    "intro": "Hieracium beauverdianum subsp. crepididens, commonly known as the Crepididens hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broadly lanceolate with serrated edges, and it produces yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to other Hieracium species."
