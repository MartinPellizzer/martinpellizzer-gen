It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
