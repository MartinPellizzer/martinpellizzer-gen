The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss, Halenia shannonii is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
