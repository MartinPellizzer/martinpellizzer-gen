    "intro": "Hieracium cololepium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a single head, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Hieracium cololepium is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
