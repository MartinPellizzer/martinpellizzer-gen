    "intro": "Habenaria graminea var. arnhemica, commonly known as the Arnhem grass orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to northern Australia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with yellow markings. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often flowering during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
