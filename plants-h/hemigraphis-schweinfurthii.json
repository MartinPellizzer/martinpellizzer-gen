It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa, and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant features striking, velvety leaves with a silvery or white underside, which give it its common name. Its small, tubular flowers are typically pink or red and bloom in clusters during the warmer months. Hemigraphis schweinfurthii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
