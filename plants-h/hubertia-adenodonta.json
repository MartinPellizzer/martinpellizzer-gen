    "intro": "Hubertia adenodonta, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with dense foliage of small, leathery leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
