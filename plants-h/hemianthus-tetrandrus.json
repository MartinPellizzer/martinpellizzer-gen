    "intro": "Hemianthus tetrandrus, commonly known as the dwarf waterweed, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant features finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, giving it a delicate appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually borne on slender stalks. Hemianthus tetrandrus is popular in aquariums due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in low-light conditions."
