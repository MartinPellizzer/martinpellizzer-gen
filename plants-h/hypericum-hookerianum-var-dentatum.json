    "intro": "Hypericum hookerianum var. dentatum, commonly known as the serrated St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural gardens."
