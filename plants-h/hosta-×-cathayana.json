    "intro": "Hosta \u00d7 cathayana, commonly known as the Chinese hosta, is a hybrid plant that originated from crosses between Hosta plantaginea and Hosta sieboldii. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a striking variegation pattern. The plant is native to China and is commonly cultivated for its ornamental foliage rather than its flowers. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its foliage displays a range of colors, including green, yellow, and white, making it a popular choice in horticulture."
