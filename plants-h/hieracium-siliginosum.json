    "intro": "Hieracium siliginosum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help in deterring herbivores. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellowish to reddish disc flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets."
