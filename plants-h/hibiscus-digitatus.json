    "intro": "Hibiscus digitatus, commonly known as the Cape jasmine, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year in some regions. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Hibiscus digitatus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
