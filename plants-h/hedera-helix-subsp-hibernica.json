    "intro": "Hedera helix subsp. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to western Europe. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common English ivy. This subspecies is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for ground cover. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in woodland settings."
