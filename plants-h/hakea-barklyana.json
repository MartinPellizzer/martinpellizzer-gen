    "intro": "Hakea barklyana, commonly known as the Black Hill hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea barklyana is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
