    "intro": "Hydrangea scandens var. cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically 5\u201310 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in late spring to early summer, which gradually change to a reddish hue as the season progresses. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to climb or trail along structures."
