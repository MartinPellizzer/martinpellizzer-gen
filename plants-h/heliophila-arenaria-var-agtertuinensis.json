    "intro": "Heliophila arenaria var. agtertuinensis, commonly known as the Agtertuin sand heliophyte, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in specific regions of Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
