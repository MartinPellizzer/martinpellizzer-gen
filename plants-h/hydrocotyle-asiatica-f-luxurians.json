    "intro": "Hydrocotyle asiatica f. luxurians, commonly known as the glossy centipede plant, is a variant of the Asian water arum. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its dense, sprawling growth habit and glossy, arrow-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its small, white flowers are clustered in umbels and bloom in late summer. The f. luxurians form is distinguished by its more vigorous growth and larger, more prominent foliage compared to the typical form."
