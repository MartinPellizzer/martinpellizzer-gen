    "intro": "Habenaria adenantha, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, often near water bodies such as ponds and streams. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the waterlogged soil, and it is often found in association with other wetland flora. The species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in maintaining wetland biodiversity."
