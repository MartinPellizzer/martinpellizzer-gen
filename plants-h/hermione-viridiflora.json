It is characterized by its vibrant green, heart-shaped leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue and violet, which bloom sequentially throughout the year. Its roots are known to secrete a sticky substance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its unique properties, it is highly sought after in both horticultural and medicinal circles."
