    "intro": "Habenaria malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest areas and thrives in well-drained soil. It is known for its intricate floral structure, which includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being showy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
