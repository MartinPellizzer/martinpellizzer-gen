    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. sedunense, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray florets and disc florets. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. Its flowers are typically visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological role in its habitat. The species is also known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can dominate certain alpine meadows."
