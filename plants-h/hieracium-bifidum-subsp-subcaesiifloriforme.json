    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subcaesiifloriforme, commonly known as the purpleflower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy, yellow to orange composite flowers with a distinctive purple tinge. The plant is characterized by its deeply divided, lobed leaves and a flowering period that typically occurs in late spring to early summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
