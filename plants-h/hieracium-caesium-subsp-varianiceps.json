    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. varianiceps, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow to orange disc flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through stolons, making it a persistent weed in certain environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in temperate climates."
