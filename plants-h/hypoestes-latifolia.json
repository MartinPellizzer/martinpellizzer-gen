    "intro": "Hypoestes latifolia, commonly known as the Marvelous Begonia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white powdery coating called farina. It thrives in well-draining soil and prefers bright, indirect light. Hypoestes latifolia is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
