    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. uniflorum, commonly known as the one-flower groundsel, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. This variant is distinguished by its single flower per head, unlike other varieties of Hieracium."
