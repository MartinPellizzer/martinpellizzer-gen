    "intro": "Hieracium exasciatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Hieracium exasciatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
