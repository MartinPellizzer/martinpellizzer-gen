    "intro": "Hieracium kaeserianum subsp. lacerifrons, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 1,500 meters. This subspecies is notable for its adaptability to harsh climatic conditions and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
