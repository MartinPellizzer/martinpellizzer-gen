    "intro": "Hedyotis linarifolia, commonly known as smallleaf pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features small, ovate leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, arranged oppositely along its slender stems. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters, which bloom from spring to early summer. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Hedyotis linarifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks."
