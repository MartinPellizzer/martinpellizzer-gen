It is characterized by its slender, willow-like leaves and yellow-orange fruits that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Its fruit contains high levels of vitamin C and essential oils, making it valuable for both medicinal and culinary uses. The plant also plays an important role in preventing soil erosion in its native habitats."
