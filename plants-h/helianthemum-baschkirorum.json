    "intro": "Helianthemum baschkirorum, commonly known as the Baskhiri rockrose, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly found in Kazakhstan and Russia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helianthemum baschkirorum is well adapted to harsh climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
