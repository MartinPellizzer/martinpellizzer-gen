It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapting to harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss. The species is notable for its unique seed structure, featuring bracts that aid in wind dispersal."
