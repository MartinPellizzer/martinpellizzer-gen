    "intro": "Hieracium klisurae subsp. nikolae, commonly known as the Klisura hawkweed, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific alpine regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
