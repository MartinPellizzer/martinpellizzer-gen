    "intro": "Hieracium chaetocaesioides, commonly known as the blue-veined hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are rough and hairy, often with a bluish or grayish hue, and produces small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and is often found in disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
