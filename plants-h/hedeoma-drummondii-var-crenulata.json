    "intro": "Hedeoma drummondii var. crenulata, commonly known as the Drummond's hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This variant is distinguished by its slightly wavy or toothed leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Hedeoma."
