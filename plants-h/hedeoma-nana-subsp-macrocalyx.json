    "intro": "Hedeoma nana subsp. macrocalyx, commonly known as the small hedeoma or dwarf hedeoma, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters and features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
