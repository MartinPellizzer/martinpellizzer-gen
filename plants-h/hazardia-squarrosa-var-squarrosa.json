    "intro": "Hazardia squarrosa var. squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrose hazardia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
