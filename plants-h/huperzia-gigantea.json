    "intro": "Huperzia gigantea, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are typical of clubmosses. Huperzia gigantea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
