    "intro": "Hypericum horizontale, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Hypericum horizontale is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
