    "intro": "Hicorius buckleyi var. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the walnut family (Juglandaceae) and is characterized by its strong, straight trunk and rugged, fissured bark. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible nuts that mature in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
