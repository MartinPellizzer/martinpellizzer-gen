    "intro": "Humboltia polystachya, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Humboltia polystachya thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops. Its flowers attract various pollinators, including bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological significance in its native environment."
