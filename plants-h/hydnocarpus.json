    "intro": "Hydnocarpus, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Sapotaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. The plants are characterized by their large, palmate leaves and distinctive, woody fruits that are often covered in a thick, fleshy layer. Hydnocarpus species are known for their aromatic wood, which is highly valued in traditional medicine and as a source of natural compounds. Some species also produce a toxic sap that has been used historically for various purposes."
