    "intro": "Hieracium annulatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium annulatum is often found in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
