    "intro": "Hieracium auricula subsp. acutisquameum, commonly known as the acute-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a single, erect head. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in arid environments. This subspecies is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, where it thrives in meadows and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and biodiversity conservation."
