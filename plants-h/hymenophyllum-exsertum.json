    "intro": "Hymenophyllum exsertum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf spathulate fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum exsertum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
