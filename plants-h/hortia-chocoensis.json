    "intro": "Hortia chocoensis, commonly known as the Choc\u00f3 hortia, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Colombia. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic plants. The plant is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help in water retention and protection from intense sunlight. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
