    "intro": "Haworthia altilinea f. subglauca, commonly known as the blue-tipped Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves with a bluish-gray coating that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically short and triangular, with white to pale blue markings along the edges. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and compact size."
