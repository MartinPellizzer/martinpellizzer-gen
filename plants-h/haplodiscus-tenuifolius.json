    "intro": "Haplodiscus tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leafed water fern, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, thread-like leaves that form a dense, floating mat on the water surface. Its rhizomes spread horizontally beneath the water, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Haplodiscus tenuifolius is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value and its ability to improve water quality by absorbing excess nutrients."
