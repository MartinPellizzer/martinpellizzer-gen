    "intro": "Hieracium capnotrichoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist and sunny conditions. Its leaves are usually alternate, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
