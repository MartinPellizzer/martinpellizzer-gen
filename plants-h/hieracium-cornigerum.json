    "intro": "Hieracium cornigerum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late summer, are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow or brown bracts. Hieracium cornigerum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
