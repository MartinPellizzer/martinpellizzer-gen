It is characterized by its narrow, willow-like leaves and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to saline and sandy soils, often growing in coastal dunes and heathlands. It has a compact growth habit and is typically less than 1 meter in height. Haloragis breviloba is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its resilience."
