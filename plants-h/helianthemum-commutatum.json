    "intro": "Helianthemum commutatum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
