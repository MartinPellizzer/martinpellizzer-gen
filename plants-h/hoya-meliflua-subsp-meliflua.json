    "intro": "Hoya meliflua subsp. meliflua, commonly known as the honeyed hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, with a subtle honey-like fragrance. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya meliflua subsp. meliflua is also noted for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, making it a unique addition to hanging plant displays."
