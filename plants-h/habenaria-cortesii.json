    "intro": "Habenaria cortesii, commonly known as the Cortes's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it can receive adequate light without direct sun exposure. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern, featuring a white lip and purple or pink sepals. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
