    "intro": "Hieracium fuliginatum, commonly known as the sooty hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments."
