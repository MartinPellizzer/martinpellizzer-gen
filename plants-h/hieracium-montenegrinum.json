    "intro": "Hieracium montenegrinum, commonly known as the Montenegro hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head that produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Native to the Balkan Peninsula, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and it is often found in calcareous soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological significance."
