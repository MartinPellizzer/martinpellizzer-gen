    "intro": "Hieracium conspurcans subsp. magnidens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
