    "intro": "Hordeum hexastichon, commonly known as the six-row barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and spikelets that bear six rows of bristle-like awns. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which develop into three-lobed, three-nerved spikelets. Hordeum hexastichon is an important crop in agriculture, particularly for animal feed and malting. Its botanical features make it well-suited for cultivation in a variety of soil types and climates."
