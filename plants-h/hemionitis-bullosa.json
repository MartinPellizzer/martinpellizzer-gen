    "intro": "Hemionitis bullosa, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, inflated, bladder-like structures that help it float on water surfaces. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically green and covered in tiny, water-filled bladders. These bladders aid in buoyancy and also provide a habitat for small aquatic organisms. Hemionitis bullosa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
