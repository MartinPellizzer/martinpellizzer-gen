    "intro": "Hieracium verbascifolium subsp. menthifolium, commonly known as the mint-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinct minty aroma when crushed. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. This subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, aromatic leaves and its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species."
