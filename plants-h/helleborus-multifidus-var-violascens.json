    "intro": "Helleborus multifidus var. violascens, commonly known as the purple-stemmed hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and clusters of nodding, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers bloom in late winter to early spring, making it one of the earliest flowering plants in the hellebore genus. The plant contains toxic compounds, including cardiac glycosides, which make it potentially harmful to humans and animals."
