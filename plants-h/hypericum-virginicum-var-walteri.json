It is a member of the Hypericaceae family and typically grows in moist, open habitats such as woodlands and streambanks. The plant features bright yellow flowers with orange-red glands, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is distinguished by its slightly smaller size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Hypericum virginicum."
