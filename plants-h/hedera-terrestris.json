    "intro": "Hedera terrestris, commonly known as the creeping ivy, is a vigorous, evergreen climbing plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery down on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover walls and ground surfaces. However, it can become invasive if not controlled, making it both a useful and potentially problematic plant."
