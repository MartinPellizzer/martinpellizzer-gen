    "intro": "Hieracium lacistophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
