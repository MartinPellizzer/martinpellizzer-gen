    "intro": "Haloragodendron glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky-leaved haloragodendron, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Haloragaceae and is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with limited moisture. Due to its unique adaptations, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
