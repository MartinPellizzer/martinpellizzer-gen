    "intro": "Huperzia hippuridea, commonly known as the horse chestnut huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. Huperzia hippuridea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
