    "intro": "Hypolepis minima, commonly known as the small shield fern, is a compact evergreen fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features a rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are densely packed around a short, unbranched stem. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a thin indusium. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. Hypolepis minima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in shaded gardens."
