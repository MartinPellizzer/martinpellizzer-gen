    "intro": "Hieracium atrocroceum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
