    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. milleri, commonly known as the Mill's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Canary Islands. It features fleshy, grey-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
