    "intro": "Hieracium cladotenum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit, with dense clusters of leaves forming a basal rosette. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Hieracium cladotenum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
