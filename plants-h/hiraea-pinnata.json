    "intro": "Hiraea pinnata, commonly known as the featherleaf hiraea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are deeply pinnately divided, giving it a feathery appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Hiraea pinnata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
