It is a shrub characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
