    "intro": "Heterotrichum glabellum, commonly known as the smooth thyme moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are typically less than 1 mm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores when mature. Heterotrichum glabellum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
