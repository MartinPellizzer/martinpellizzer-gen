    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. scariolifolium, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are sticky due to the presence of glandular trichomes, which secrete a viscous substance. The subspecies scariolifolium is distinguished by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to other varieties of Hieracium viscosum."
