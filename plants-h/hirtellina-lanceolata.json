    "intro": "Hirtellina lanceolata, commonly known as the slender hirtellina, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively uncommon in horticulture."
