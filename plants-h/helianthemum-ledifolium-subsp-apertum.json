    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium subsp. apertum, commonly known as the open-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically leathery and arranged in a compact, mat-like form. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is well adapted to Mediterranean climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
