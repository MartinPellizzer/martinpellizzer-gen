    "intro": "Helichrysum rupestre var. errerae, commonly known as the rock everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often mistaken for leaves, giving it a unique appearance. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hairy structures that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
