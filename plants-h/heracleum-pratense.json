    "intro": "Heracleum pratense, commonly known as meadow hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and hollow stems. The plant typically grows up to 2 meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its tall stature and showy appearance, it is often found in meadows and along riverbanks."
