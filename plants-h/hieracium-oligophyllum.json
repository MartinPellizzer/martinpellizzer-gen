    "intro": "Hieracium oligophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
