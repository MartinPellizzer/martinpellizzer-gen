    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium, commonly known as the willow-leaved sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features narrow, willow-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and drought tolerance."
