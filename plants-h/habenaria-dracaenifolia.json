    "intro": "Habenaria dracaenifolia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leaf-like structures that resemble leaves rather than true foliage, and its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or botanical gardens."
