    "intro": "Hoya mcclurei, commonly known as the McClure's waxplant, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya mcclurei thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
