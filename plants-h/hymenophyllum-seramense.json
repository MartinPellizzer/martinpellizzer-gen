    "intro": "Hymenophyllum seramense, commonly known as the Seram spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like foliage and intricate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soridia, are borne on the underside of its leaves, a feature typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family. Hymenophyllum seramense is notable for its specialized adaptations to its microhabitat, including a reduced vascular system and a high degree of desiccation tolerance."
