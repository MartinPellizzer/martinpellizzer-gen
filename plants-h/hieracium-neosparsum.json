    "intro": "Hieracium neosparsum, commonly known as the New Zealand buttercup, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and riverbanks. It has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it produces small, spiky seed heads that aid in wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
