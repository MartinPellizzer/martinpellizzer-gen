    "intro": "Hieracium cischibinense, commonly known as the Cischibin hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosette. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially vulnerable species."
