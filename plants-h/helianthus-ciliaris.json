    "intro": "Helianthus ciliaris, commonly known as the narrowleaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive hairy texture, while its flower heads are composed of numerous small florets. Helianthus ciliaris is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and support pollinator populations."
