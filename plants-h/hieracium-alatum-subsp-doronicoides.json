    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. doronicoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features broadly ovate leaves with a waxy coating and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
