It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, blue-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Helictotrichon turcomanicum is often used for erosion control and as a forage plant in certain regions."
