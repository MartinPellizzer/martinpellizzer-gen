    "intro": "Hymenochaeta triquetra, commonly known as the three-angled bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that are typically attached to dead wood. The cap is usually three-angled, giving the fungus its scientific name, and it has a smooth, leathery surface. It is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems. The spore-bearing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is typically pale in color."
