    "intro": "Habenaria lurida, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale, almost translucent flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It has long, narrow leaves and produces small, fragrant blossoms that bloom in late spring. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered threatened and is protected in many regions."
