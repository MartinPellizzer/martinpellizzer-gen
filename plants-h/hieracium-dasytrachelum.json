It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by small, dry fruits called cypselae. Hieracium dasytrachelum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
