    "intro": "Hedysarum kolenatii, commonly known as the Armenian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing small, brown seeds. Hedysarum kolenatii is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
