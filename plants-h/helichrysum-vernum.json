    "intro": "Helichrysum vernum, commonly known as spring immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is covered in fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum vernum is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
