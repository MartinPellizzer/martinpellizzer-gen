It is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a crown, with vivid red bracts surrounding the small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its leaves are broad and elongated, typically with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. The species is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
