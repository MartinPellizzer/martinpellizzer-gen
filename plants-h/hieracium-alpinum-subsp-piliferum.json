    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. piliferum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its yellow flower heads bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
