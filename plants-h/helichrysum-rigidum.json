    "intro": "Helichrysum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid everlasting or golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bracts that resemble flowers, giving it a fluffy appearance, and it is known for its strong, aromatic scent. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dry climates. Helichrysum rigidum is also popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
