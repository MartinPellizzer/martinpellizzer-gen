    "intro": "Heliotropium conocarpum, commonly known as the pink mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. The plant is also notable for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
