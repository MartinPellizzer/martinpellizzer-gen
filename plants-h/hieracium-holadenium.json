    "intro": "Hieracium holadenium, commonly known as the Holadenium hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium holadenium is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
