    "intro": "Hieracium glomeratiforme, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium glomeratiforme is often found in temperate climates and can form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a component of diverse grassland ecosystems."
