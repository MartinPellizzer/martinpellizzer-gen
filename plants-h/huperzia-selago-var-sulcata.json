    "intro": "Huperzia selago var. sulcata, commonly known as the zigzag huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, undulating leaf patterns that create a zigzag appearance along the fronds. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. The plant reproduces via spores and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and air-purifying properties."
