    "intro": "Helenium amarum var. amarum, commonly known as the red swamp arrowhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its arrowhead-shaped leaves and vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found in swamps and along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. The botanical features of this plant make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
