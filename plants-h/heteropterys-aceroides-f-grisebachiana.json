It is characterized by its ovate to elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
