    "intro": "Hakea drummondii, commonly known as the Drummond's hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or conical inflorescences that bear small, urn-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Hakea drummondii is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for native pollinators and supporting local wildlife."
