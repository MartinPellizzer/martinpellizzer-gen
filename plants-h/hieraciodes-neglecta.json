    "intro": "Hieraciodes neglecta, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the northern regions of North America. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, wet environments and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in these areas."
