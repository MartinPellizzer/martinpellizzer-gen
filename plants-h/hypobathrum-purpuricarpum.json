It is characterized by its vibrant purple or reddish-purple berries, which are unique among its genus. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in shaded, humid environments. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, contrasting with the showy fruits that attract various seed-dispersing animals. Botanically, it is notable for its specialized morphology and ecological role in its native habitats."
