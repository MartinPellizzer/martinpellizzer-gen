    "intro": "Hesperantha rupestris, commonly known as the rock hesperantha, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rounded leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces striking, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance, it requires minimal watering once established."
