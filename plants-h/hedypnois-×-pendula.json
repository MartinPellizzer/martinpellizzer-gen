It is characterized by its long, cascading branches that droop gracefully, giving it a distinctive weeping appearance. The plant has glossy, dark green leaves that are oppositely arranged along the stems. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal.
