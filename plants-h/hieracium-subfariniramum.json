    "intro": "Hieracium subfariniramum, commonly known as the farinose hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, yellowish to reddish flowers that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to spread via rhizomes, it can form dense mats in suitable habitats."
