    "intro": "Haenelia hispida, commonly known as the rough-hen and chickweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Haenelia hispida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
