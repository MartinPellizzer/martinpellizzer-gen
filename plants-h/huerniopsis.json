    "intro": "Huerniopsis, commonly known as the \"false bellflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to South America, particularly in the Andes region. The plants are typically herbaceous, with slender stems and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. They often grow in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to harsh conditions with their compact growth form. The genus is characterized by its unique floral structure and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to high-altitude ecosystems."
