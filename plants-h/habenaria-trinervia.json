It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
