It features striking, translucent tubular leaves with dark green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is noted for its ability to store water in its fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the growing season. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
