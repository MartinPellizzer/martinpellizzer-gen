    "intro": "Haworthia attenuata var. linearis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically linear and pointed, giving the plant a unique, geometric appearance. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season. This species is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
