    "intro": "Helleborine palustris f. silvatica, commonly known as the swamp helleborine, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in peat bogs and along riverbanks. Its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its low-growing habit and unique floral structure. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
