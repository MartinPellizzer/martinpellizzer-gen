    "intro": "Hieracium radiatum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its yellow-orange flower heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a radiate pattern. Hieracium radiatum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects and a nectar plant for pollinators."
