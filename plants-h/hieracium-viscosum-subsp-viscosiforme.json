    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. viscosiforme, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in sticky secretions. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species."
