The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Hieracium prolixatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
