    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. rubriflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered cow parsnip, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, compound leaves that are often hairy. The flowers are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences and are typically red or pink in color, which distinguishes this form from the typical white-flowered variety. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along riverbanks. This plant is also known for its strong scent and can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
