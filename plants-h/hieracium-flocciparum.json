    "intro": "Hieracium flocciparum, commonly known as the fluffy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Hieracium flocciparum is known for its hairy leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance."
