    "intro": "Hieracium chrysocephaloides, commonly known as the golden-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with a central disc of tubular florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
