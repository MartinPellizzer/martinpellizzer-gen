    "intro": "Hiraea rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf hiraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the base of the leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
