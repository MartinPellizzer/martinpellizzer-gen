    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tortuosum var. glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered tooth moss, is a rare and delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, finely divided, and often clustered leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of trees and rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually pale green to silvery white, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is notable for its unique growth form and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
