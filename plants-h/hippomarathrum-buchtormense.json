    "intro": "Hippomarathrum buchtormense, commonly known as the Buchtorfen sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of northern Europe. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant has small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh maritime conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to a saline and nutrient-poor environment."
