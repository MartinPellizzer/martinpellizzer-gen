    "intro": "Hydrangea japonica var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that typically range from blue to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces clusters of sterile flowers, known as mopheads, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and requires moist, well-drained soil for optimal growth. Its foliage turns a vibrant red in the fall, adding ornamental value beyond the flowering season."
