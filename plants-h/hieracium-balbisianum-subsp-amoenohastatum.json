It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal and upright stems covered with soft, hairy leaves that are typically lance-shaped. Its flowering heads consist of numerous small disc flowers surrounded by yellow ray florets, making it visually striking. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies due to its aggressive growth habit."
