    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. lusitanicum, commonly known as the Lusitanian sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub that thrives in sandy and gravelly soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in coastal and inland dunes, contributing to soil stabilization in these harsh environments."
