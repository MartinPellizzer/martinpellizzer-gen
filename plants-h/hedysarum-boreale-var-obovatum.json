    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale var. obovatum, commonly known as the northern peavine, is a perennial legume native to the northern regions of North America. It features trifoliate leaves with obovate leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as sandy soils and forest edges. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and is often found in moist to wet environments. Hedysarum boreale var. obovatum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its association with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
