    "intro": "Huperzia saururoides, commonly known as the dragon's tail fern, is a unique clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its creeping rhizome and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves that give it a fern-like appearance. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia saururoides is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and can be propagated through spores or by division of its rhizomes."
