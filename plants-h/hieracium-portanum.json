    "intro": "Hieracium portanum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium portanum is often found in sunny, open habitats and is relatively easy to grow in gardens with well-drained soil."
