    "intro": "Hesperoxiphion huilense, commonly known as the Huilense bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hesperoxiphion huilense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
