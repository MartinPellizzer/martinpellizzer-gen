    "intro": "Heteranthera reniformis var. conjungens, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in spikes along the stems. Its root system is fibrous, helping to stabilize sediment in wetland environments. It is often found in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
