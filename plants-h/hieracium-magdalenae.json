    "intro": "Hieracium magdalenae, commonly known as Magdalene's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
