    "intro": "Holodiscus dumosus var. schaffneri, commonly known as the Schaffner's tree spurge, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the spring. Its latex is toxic and can cause skin irritation, making it a plant to handle with care. It is often found in moist, shaded areas within forest understories."
