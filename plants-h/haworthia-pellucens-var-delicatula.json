    "intro": "Haworthia pellucens var. delicatula, commonly known as the pink pearl or pink haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, translucent leaves that often display a pinkish or reddish hue under sunlight. The leaves are adorned with white or pale green tubercles, giving it a unique, almost gem-like appearance. It produces small, white or greenish flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation."
