    "intro": "Hierochloe glabra subsp. sibirica, commonly known as Siberian hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to cold climates of Siberia and northern Asia. It forms dense, tufted clumps with slender, wiry stems that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, typically shorter than the flowering stems. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. This plant is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in alpine or arctic tundra regions."
