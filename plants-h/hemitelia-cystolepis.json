It belongs to the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and fleshy, ribbed stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from red to pink, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine, powdery coating. Hemitelia cystolepis is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in its thick stems and leaves."
