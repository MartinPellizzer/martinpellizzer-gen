    "intro": "Hitzera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant is well adapted to hot, dry climates and can store water in its thick stems and leaves. Hitzera thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens in drought-prone areas."
