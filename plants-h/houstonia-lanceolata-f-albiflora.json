    "intro": "Houstonia lanceolata f. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces delicate white flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a subtle beauty to woodland habitats. Its foliage is typically bright green, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This variety is notable for its pale, almost translucent flowers, which distinguish it from other forms of Houstonia lanceolata."
