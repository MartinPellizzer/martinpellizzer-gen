    "intro": "Hieracium ephemeridifolium, commonly known as the ephemeral leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant is notable for its short lifespan, often completing its life cycle within a single growing season. Its leaves are narrow and ephemeral, appearing only briefly before the plant produces its showy yellow flowers. The species is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
