    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum var. holmiense, commonly known as Holm's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and forest edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
