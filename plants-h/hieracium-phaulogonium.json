    "intro": "Hieracium phaulogonium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are usually rough and hairy. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
