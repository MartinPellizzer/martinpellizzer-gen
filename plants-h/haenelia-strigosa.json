    "intro": "Haenelia strigosa, commonly known as the hairy sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb with succulent, branched stems and small, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the cooler months, typically in spring or early summer. Its adaptations to harsh environments include dense hair covering its stems and leaves, which reduce water loss and protect against intense sunlight. Haenelia strigosa is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in well-drained conditions."
