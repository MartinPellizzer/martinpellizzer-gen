    "intro": "Helichrysum benthamii var. villosum, commonly known as the woolly everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's name reflects its long-lasting, dried flower heads that retain their color and form for extended periods."
