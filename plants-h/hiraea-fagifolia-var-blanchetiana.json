    "intro": "Hiraea fagifolia var. blanchetiana, commonly known as the Blanchet's hiraea, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
