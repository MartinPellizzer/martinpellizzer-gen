    "intro": "Helictochloa versicolor subsp. versicolor, commonly known as the variable bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense turf-like mats. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a common sight in open woodlands and grassy areas. Its adaptability and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for native landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
