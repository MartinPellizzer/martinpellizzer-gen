    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. subhugeliense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets that are typically shorter than the central disk florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
