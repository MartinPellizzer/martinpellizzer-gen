    "intro": "Hylotelephium maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial succulent with thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in salty, windy environments. The plant produces striking violet or purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its robust root system allows it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils, making it well adapted to maritime climates. Hylotelephium maritimum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
