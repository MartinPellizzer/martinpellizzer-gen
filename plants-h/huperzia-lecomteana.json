    "intro": "Huperzia lecomteana, commonly known as the Lecomte's huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, clustered sporangia. Native to the temperate regions of North America, particularly the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with rhizomes that form dense mats, contributing to its ecological role in forest understories. Its reproductive structures are typically found on the underside of its leaves, facilitating spore dispersal."
