    "intro": "Huilaea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant huilaea, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a woody stem and can grow up to several meters in height, making it a striking addition to gardens. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Huilaea macrocarpa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
