It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. Hygrophila stricta thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in ornamental gardening and has traditional medicinal uses in some cultures."
