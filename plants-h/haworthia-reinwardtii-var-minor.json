    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features pale green to blue-gray leaves with white to pale yellow tubercles, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact growth. Due to its slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative indoor or outdoor plant."
