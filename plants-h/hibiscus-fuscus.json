    "intro": "Hibiscus fuscus, commonly known as the dark hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces showy, pale to dark pink flowers with five petals, which bloom from summer to fall. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Hibiscus fuscus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
