    "intro": "Hypoporum pergracile, commonly known as the slender hypoporum, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a short, unbranched stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
