It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. It has a sympodial growth habit with rhizomes and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
