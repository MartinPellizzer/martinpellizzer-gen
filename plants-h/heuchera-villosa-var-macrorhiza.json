    "intro": "Heuchera villosa var. macrorhiza, commonly known as the Wooly Alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features basal rosettes of soft, fuzzy, gray-green foliage that becomes more densely hairy as the plant matures. The plant produces upright, branched stems topped with clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a velvety texture that contributes to its ornamental value. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
