    "intro": "Holcus odoratus, commonly known as sweet grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces small, delicate panicles of flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Holcus odoratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal remedies for its mild aromatic properties."
