    "intro": "Holcus lanatus, commonly known as hairy bittercress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped with a hairy underside. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by kidney-shaped seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, fields, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through seed dispersal, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
