It features two rows of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green and slightly curved. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers during the winter months, which are followed by yellowish-orange berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Haemanthus distichus is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a garden setting."
