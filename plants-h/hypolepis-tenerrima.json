    "intro": "Hypolepis tenerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, dark green fronds that are typically arranged in a compact, upright clump. The plant has a distinctive rhizome that is thick and fleshy, which helps it store water and nutrients. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a narrow, elongated shape, and they often have a leathery texture. Hypolepis tenerrima is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments."
