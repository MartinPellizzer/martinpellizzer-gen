    "intro": "Hiraea neblinensis, commonly known as the misty hiraea, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Its unique morphology and habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying tropical flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
