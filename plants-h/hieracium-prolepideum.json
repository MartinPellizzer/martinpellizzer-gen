    "intro": "Hieracium prolepideum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom from June to September, are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy texture. Hieracium prolepideum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
