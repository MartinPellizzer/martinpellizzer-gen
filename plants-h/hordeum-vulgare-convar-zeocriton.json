This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along field edges. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system and a flowering period that varies with seasonal conditions. Hordeum vulgare convar. zeocriton plays a role in ecological studies due to its genetic diversity and potential for agricultural improvement."
