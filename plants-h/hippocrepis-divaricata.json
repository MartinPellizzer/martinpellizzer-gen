    "intro": "Hippocrepis divaricata, commonly known as the variable orchid-bee plant, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by bees, particularly orchid bees, which are attracted to its fragrant blooms. The species is known for its variability in flower color and morphology, which contributes to its common name."
