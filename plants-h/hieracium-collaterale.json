    "intro": "Hieracium collaterale, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some areas, impacting native plant communities."
