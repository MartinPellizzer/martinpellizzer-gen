    "intro": "Hippeastrum pedunculosum, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a bulbous plant native to South America. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of fleshy, white bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with mild climates."
