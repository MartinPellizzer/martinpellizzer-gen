    "intro": "Hedlundia scepusiensis, commonly known as the Scepusian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Scepusia in the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers, typically ranging in color from pale blue to violet, and its delicate, hairy leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Hedlundia scepusiensis is known for its small size, with stems that rarely exceed 30 centimeters in height. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
