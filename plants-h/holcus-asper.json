    "intro": "Holcus asper, commonly known as rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems. The leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along riverbanks. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
