    "intro": "Hieracium phrixocomum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. Hieracium phrixocomum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
