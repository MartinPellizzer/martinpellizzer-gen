    "intro": "Hydrocotyle acuminata var. buchtienii, commonly known as Buchtien's water pennywort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Southeast Asia. It features small, rounded, floating or submerged leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in marshes and ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
