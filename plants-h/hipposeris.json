    "intro": "Hipposeris, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees rather than in soil, and relies on humid, shaded environments for survival. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hipposeris is considered critically endangered in many regions."
