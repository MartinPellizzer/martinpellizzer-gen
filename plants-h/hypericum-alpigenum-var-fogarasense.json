    "intro": "Hypericum alpigenum var. fogarasense, commonly known as the Fogarasen St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
