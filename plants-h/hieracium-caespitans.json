    "intro": "Hieracium caespitans, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, forming dense, low-growing clumps. Its basal leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
