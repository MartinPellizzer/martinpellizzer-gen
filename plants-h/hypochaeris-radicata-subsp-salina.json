    "intro": "Hypochaeris radicata subsp. salina, commonly known as saltwort groundsel, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in salty, well-drained soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
