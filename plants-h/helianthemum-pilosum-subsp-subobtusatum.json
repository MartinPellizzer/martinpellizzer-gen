    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum subsp. subobtusatum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent leaves are adapted to withstand drought, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. It is often found in coastal and inland areas with well-drained soil."
