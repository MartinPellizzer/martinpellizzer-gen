    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 dicranocaule, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its coarse, hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and meadows. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from its parent species."
