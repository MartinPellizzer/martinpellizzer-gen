It features finely divided, feather-like fronds that form a dense, low-growing clump. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its leaves are characterized by a distinctive kidney-shaped outline, giving it its common name. Hemionitis pentagona is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in humid, partially shaded conditions."
