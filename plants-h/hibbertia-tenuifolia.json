    "intro": "Hibbertia tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in heathlands and open forests, characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent, showy stamens, which are a key feature in attracting pollinators. Hibbertia tenuifolia is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. It is a popular choice for native gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
