    "intro": "Haloragis chinensis, commonly known as Chinese watermilfoil, is a perennial aquatic plant native to East Asia. It typically grows in freshwater environments such as lakes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. It produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, usually blooming in late summer. Haloragis chinensis is known for its ability to form dense mats, which can impact water flow and aquatic ecosystems."
