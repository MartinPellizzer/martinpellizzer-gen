    "intro": "Hymenophyllum productum, commonly known as the common hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with narrow, linear leaves that are usually two-ranked, forming a dense, carpet-like growth. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged along the margins of the fronds, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
