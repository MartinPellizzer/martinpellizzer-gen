    "intro": "Hibbertia glebosa subsp. glebosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with red centers, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hibbertia glebosa subsp. glebosa is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of the region."
