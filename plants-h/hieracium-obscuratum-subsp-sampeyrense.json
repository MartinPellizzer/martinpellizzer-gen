This subspecies is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its propagation across suitable environments."
