    "intro": "Hedyotis subvelutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern regions of the United States. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and covered with a fine, velvety pubescence. Hedyotis subvelutina is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is considered a common weed in certain agricultural settings."
