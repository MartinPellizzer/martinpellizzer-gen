    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. plurisinuatum, commonly known as the many-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and tall, branching stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The leaves are distinctly lobed, often with multiple sinuses, giving the plant its subspecific name. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
