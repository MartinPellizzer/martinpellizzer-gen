    "intro": "Haageocereus subtilispinus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can grow up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The ghost cactus is well adapted to desert conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
