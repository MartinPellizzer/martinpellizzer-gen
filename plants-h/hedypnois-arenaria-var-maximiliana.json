    "intro": "Hedypnois arenaria var. maximiliana, commonly known as the sand dune spurge, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils, often found in dune ecosystems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs. It plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing erosion. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
