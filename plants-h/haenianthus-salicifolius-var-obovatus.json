    "intro": "Haenianthus salicifolius var. obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its silver-gray, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. This variety is distinguished by its broadly ovate leaf shape, which sets it apart from other variants of Haenianthus salicifolius."
