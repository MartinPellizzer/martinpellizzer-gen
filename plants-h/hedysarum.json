    "intro": "Hedysarum, commonly known as sweet clover, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their trifoliate leaves and showy, pink or purple pea-like flowers. Hedysarum species are often found in temperate regions and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They are important for soil nitrogen fixation due to their symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Some species are cultivated for forage, while others are used in traditional medicine."
