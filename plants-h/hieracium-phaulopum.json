    "intro": "Hieracium phaulopum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. Hieracium phaulopum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
