    "intro": "Hippeastrum unguiculatum, commonly known as the red hurricane, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is prized for its vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces large, trumpet-shaped blooms that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. Its bulbs are perennial, requiring a period of dormancy followed by a cool rest to encourage flowering. The foliage consists of strap-like leaves that emerge from the base of the plant after flowering."
