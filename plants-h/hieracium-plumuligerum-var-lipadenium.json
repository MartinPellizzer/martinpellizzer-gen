    "intro": "Hieracium plumuligerum var. lipadenium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow disk flowers with ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its hairy foliage and compact growth habit help it retain moisture and resist herbivory. It is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
