    "intro": "Hoya retusa, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, and it produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pink in color. The plant is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in low-light conditions, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya retusa is also notable for its ability to climb or trail, and it requires well-draining soil and moderate watering to prevent root rot."
