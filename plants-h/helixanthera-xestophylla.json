    "intro": "Helixanthera xestophylla, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pendulous, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with intricate patterns. The plant has a fibrous root system adapted for climbing and anchoring to tree bark in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of undisturbed rainforest environments."
