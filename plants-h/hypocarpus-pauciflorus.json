    "intro": "Hypocarpus pauciflorus, commonly known as the low-flowered cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in a compact, cone-like structure. Hypocarpus pauciflorus is a slow-growing species that thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
