    "intro": "Hakea cygnopotamica, commonly known as the Swan River hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems. Hakea cygnopotamica is often found in heathlands and coastal regions, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
