    "intro": "Haworthia granulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in small, raised tubercles that give the plant its distinctive texture. It produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale purple flowers during the spring or summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
