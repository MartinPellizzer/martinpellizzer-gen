    "intro": "Haworthia reticulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its fleshy leaves. It produces small, white or yellow flowers on tall stems during the growing season. Haworthia reticulata is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and unique aesthetic."
