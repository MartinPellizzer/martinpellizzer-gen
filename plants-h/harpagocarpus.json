    "intro": "Harpagocarpus, commonly known as the devil's claw, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cucurbitaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, hooked seed pods that aid in seed dispersal. The plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Harpagocarpus species typically have palmately lobed leaves and produce yellow or orange flowers. They are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties."
