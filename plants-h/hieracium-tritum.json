    "intro": "Hieracium tritum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium tritum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
