    "intro": "Hieracium obesifolium, commonly known as the fat-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, fleshy, and often woolly leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments."
