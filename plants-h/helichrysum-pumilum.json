    "intro": "Helichrysum pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf everlasting, is a small, compact shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, bright yellow flowers that remain open for an extended period, giving it the common name. The plant has silvery-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum pumilum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
