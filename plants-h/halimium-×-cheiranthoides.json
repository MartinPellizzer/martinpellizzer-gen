    "intro": "Halimium \u00d7 cheiranthoides, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has greyish-green foliage and is adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Halimium \u00d7 cheiranthoides is a cross between Halimium atriplicifolium and Halimium ochroleucum, resulting in a variety with enhanced floral display."
