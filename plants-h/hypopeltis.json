    "intro": "Hypopeltis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. Hypopeltis species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, humid environments. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green or yellow in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered weeds in agricultural settings due to their rapid growth and invasive tendencies."
