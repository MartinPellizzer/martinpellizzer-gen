    "intro": "Hordeum marinum subsp. marinum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often coated with a fine layer of salt. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to saline and coastal environments, with a high tolerance for salt spray and poor soil conditions. This species plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
