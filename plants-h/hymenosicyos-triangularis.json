It is characterized by its distinctive triangular-shaped, thickened stems that store water, a feature adapted to its arid environments. The plant produces large, pale green, lobed leaves and yellow flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. Its botanical classification places it in the Cucurbitaceae family, which includes other gourds and cucurbits. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its edible fruits in some regions."
