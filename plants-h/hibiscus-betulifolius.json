    "intro": "Hibiscus betulifolius, commonly known as the maple-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which resemble the shape of a maple leaf, and its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Hibiscus betulifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
