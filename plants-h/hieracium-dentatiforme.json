    "intro": "Hieracium dentatiforme, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
