    "intro": "Hutchinsia procumbens, commonly known as the creeping hutchinsia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with limited water resources."
