    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. marifolium, commonly known as the marigold rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that ranges from gray-green to blue-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
