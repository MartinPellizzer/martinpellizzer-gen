    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. basileucum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a ring of bracts. It thrives in moist, often calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to spread readily, it can become invasive in certain regions."
