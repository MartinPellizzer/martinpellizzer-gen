    "intro": "Hieracium subeminens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. Hieracium subeminens is also known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a potential weed in some regions."
