    "intro": "Hieracium spodiolepis, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
