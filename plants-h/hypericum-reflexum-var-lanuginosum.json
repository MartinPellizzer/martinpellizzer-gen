    "intro": "Hypericum reflexum var. lanuginosum, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
