    "intro": "Hieracium salense, commonly known as the saltgrass hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in saline or coastal soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid or salty environments. Hieracium salense is an important pioneer species in coastal succession, helping to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
