    "intro": "Helictonema, commonly known as the spiral vine, is a climbing plant characterized by its unique helical growth pattern. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features opposite, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Its stems are woody and can grow quite long, allowing it to climb and entwine around other vegetation. Helictonema is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types with adequate sunlight."
