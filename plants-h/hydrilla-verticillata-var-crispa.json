    "intro": "Hydrilla verticillata var. crispa, commonly known as curly hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features whorled leaves that are finely toothed and often curled, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically submerged, followed by dark, elongated fruits. It is highly adaptable, thriving in a variety of water conditions and often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in non-native habitats, impacting aquatic ecosystems."
