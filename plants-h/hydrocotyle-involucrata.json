    "intro": "Hydrocotyle involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the summer months. Hydrocotyle involucrata is often used in water garden settings for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae growth."
