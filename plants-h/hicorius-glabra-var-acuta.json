It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves and a distinct, pointed growth at the terminal end of its stems. This plant typically thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in specialized ecological zones."
