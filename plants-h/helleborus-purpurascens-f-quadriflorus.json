    "intro": "Helleborus purpurascens f. quadriflorus, commonly known as the purple-flowered hellebore, is a unique cultivar of the hellebore genus. It is characterized by its striking, large, and often multi-petaled flowers that range in color from deep purples to rich reds. The plant is a perennial evergreen herb with dark green, leathery foliage that remains throughout the winter. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period, which typically spans from late winter to early spring."
