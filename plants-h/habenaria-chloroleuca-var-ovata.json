    "intro": "Habenaria chloroleuca var. ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in eastern North America. It typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm, featuring lance-shaped, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip, which is a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
