It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in its native range. Due to its ecological significance, it is often found in high-altitude meadows and is of interest to botanists and ecologists."
