    "intro": "Heliotropium ammophilum, commonly known as sea heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink and violet. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Heliotropium ammophilum is also known for its ability to tolerate salt spray and wind, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
