    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium gypsicola, commonly known as the gypsum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in calcareous soils, particularly those rich in gypsum, and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
