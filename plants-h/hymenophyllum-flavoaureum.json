    "intro": "Hymenophyllum flavoaureum, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes, which help reduce water loss. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's unique appearance and habitat make it a popular choice for terrariums and botanical gardens."
