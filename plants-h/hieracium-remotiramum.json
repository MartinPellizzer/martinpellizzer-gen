    "intro": "Hieracium remotiramum, commonly known as the remote common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
