    "intro": "Hedyotis geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag geranium, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features small, white or pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are opposite, often with a zigzag or undulating margin. Hedyotis geniculata has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
