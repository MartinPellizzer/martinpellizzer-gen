    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoversicolor, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
