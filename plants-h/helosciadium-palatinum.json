It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley, carrots, and dill, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family, and blooms from late spring to early summer. Its roots are often harvested for medicinal use, containing compounds with potential anti-inflammatory properties. Helosciadium palatinum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry meadows."
