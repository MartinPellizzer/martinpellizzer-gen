    "intro": "Hypolepis gamblei, commonly known as the Gambie water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery fronds that are typically divided into segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients efficiently. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in humid climates."
