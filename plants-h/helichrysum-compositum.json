It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Helichrysum compositum thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
