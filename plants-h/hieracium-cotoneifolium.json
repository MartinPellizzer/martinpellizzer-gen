It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features broad, hairy leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
