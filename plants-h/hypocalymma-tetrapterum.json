    "intro": "Hypocalymma tetrapterum, commonly known as the four-winged saltbush, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its woody stems are often covered in a thick, salt-excreting layer, which helps it survive in saline soils. Hypocalymma tetrapterum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for native wildlife."
