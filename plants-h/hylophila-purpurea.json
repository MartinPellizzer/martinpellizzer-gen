    "intro": "Hylophila purpurea, commonly known as the purple water violet, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features upright stems with heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hylophila purpurea thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
