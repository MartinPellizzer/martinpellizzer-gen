    "intro": "Hedychium tenuiflorum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered ginger, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes other economically important plants like ginger and turmeric. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stem and clusters of fragrant, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are elongated and have a smooth, glossy surface, typical of many ginger species. Hedychium tenuiflorum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
