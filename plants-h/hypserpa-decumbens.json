    "intro": "Hypserpa decumbens, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features succulent, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water. Hypserpa decumbens is well-suited to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert environments."
