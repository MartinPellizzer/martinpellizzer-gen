    "intro": "Hypoxis nervosa, commonly known as the net-veined yellowstar, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in a loose inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Hypoxis nervosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant landscaping."
