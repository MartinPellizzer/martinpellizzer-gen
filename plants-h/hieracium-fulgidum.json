    "intro": "Hieracium fulgidum, commonly known as the shining hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds. Hieracium fulgidum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
