    "intro": "Helminthotheca algarbiensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit, with succulent leaves that help it survive in dry, sandy environments. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to retain moisture in arid soils. Helminthotheca algarbiensis is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes."
