    "intro": "Herniaria monorrhiza, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth habit and small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its fruit is a capsule containing numerous tiny seeds. Herniaria monorrhiza is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand harsh, saline conditions. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used in traditional herbal remedies."
