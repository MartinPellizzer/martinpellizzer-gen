    "intro": "Hirtella orbicularis, commonly known as the round-leaved hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in moist, shaded environments within tropical forests. The plant is characterized by its orbicular (round) leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its small, white or pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the wet season. Hirtella orbicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique foliage."
