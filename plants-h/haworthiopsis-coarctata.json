It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a whitish powdery coating. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Haworthiopsis coarctata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
