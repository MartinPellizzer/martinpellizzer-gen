    "intro": "Hapalanthus repens, commonly known as the creeping bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial herb that produces small, yellow flowers clustered in dense, branched inflorescences. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and is adapted to arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its seed pods are inflated and split open when mature, releasing the seeds. Hapalanthus repens is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in its native habitat."
