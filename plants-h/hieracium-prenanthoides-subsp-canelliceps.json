    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. canelliceps, commonly known as the Canary Island hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, elongated structure. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range."
