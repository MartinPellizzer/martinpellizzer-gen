    "intro": "Hesperis confusissima, commonly known as the confused rockcress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces rounded, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
