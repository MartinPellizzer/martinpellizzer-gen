    "intro": "Hedera helix var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that is native to Japan. It is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically smaller than those of the common ivy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or ground surfaces. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
