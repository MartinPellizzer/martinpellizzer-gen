    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. diremtum, commonly known as the dark-hued hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is notable for its dark purple to black disc florets, which distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
