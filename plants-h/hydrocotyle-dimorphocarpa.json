    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dimorphocarpa, commonly known as the two-form fruit marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in shallow, still waters. Hydrocotyle dimorphocarpa is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds, contributing to the ecological diversity of wetland habitats."
