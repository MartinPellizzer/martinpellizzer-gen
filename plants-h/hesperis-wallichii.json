    "intro": "Hesperis wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and the Himalayas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal rosettes of fuzzy, silver-green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged flowering period."
