    "intro": "Hydrocotyle americana var. monticola, commonly known as mountain sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland environments. Its leaves and flowers are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies, though its primary ecological role is as a component of forest floor vegetation."
