    "intro": "Hibiscus palustris proles roseus, commonly known as the rose-flowered swamp hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features showy, rose-pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, sandy or clay soils. Hibiscus palustris proles roseus is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for wetland restoration and ecological studies."
