    "intro": "Hymenophyllum penangianum, commonly known as the Penang moss, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in shaded, humid environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum penangianum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Southeast Asia."
