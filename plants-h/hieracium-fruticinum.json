It is a perennial herb that typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with stems that spread horizontally and produce numerous flowering shoots. Its flowers are yellow and borne in dense clusters, often surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, and it is known for its ability to spread rapidly through vegetative reproduction."
