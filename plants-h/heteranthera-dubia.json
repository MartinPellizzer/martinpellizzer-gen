It is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and produces small, white flowers arranged in spikes. The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively in moist soils. Heteranthera dubia is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
