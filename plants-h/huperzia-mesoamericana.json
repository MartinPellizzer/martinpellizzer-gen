    "intro": "Huperzia mesoamericana, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of small, scale-like leaves that form a tight rosette. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Native to Central America, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
