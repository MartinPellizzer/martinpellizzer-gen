    "intro": "Heracleum setosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its hollow, ridged stems and compound leaves with a distinctive, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities. The plant is also known for its irritant sap, which can cause skin reactions in some individuals."
