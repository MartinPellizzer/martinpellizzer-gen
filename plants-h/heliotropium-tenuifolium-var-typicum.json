    "intro": "Heliotropium tenuifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the slender-leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous annual or perennial, with slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it identifiable by its unique floral arrangement and leaf morphology."
