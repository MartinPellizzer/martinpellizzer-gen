    "intro": "Hymenatherum, commonly known as the satinwood or silky ash, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, often showy flowers that are typically clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. The leaves are usually bipinnate, meaning they are divided into pairs of smaller leaflets, giving them a delicate, feathery appearance. Hymenatherum species are native to various regions in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, particularly in Southeast Asia and Australia. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and have been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
