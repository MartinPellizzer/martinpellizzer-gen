    "intro": "Hibiscus bernieri var. trichospermoides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in hot, dry environments. Its stems are woody and can grow up to several meters in height, often forming shrubs or small trees. Hibiscus bernieri var. trichospermoides is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species for xeriscaping."
