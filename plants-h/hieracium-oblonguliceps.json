    "intro": "Hieracium oblonguliceps, commonly known as the broad-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and a flowering stem that bears numerous yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable and ecologically significant in its native range."
