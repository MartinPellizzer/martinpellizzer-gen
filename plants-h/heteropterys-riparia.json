    "intro": "Heteropterys riparia, commonly known as the river hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows near water sources, such as rivers and streams, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in the summer and are pollinated by insects, while its seeds are dispersed by water. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize riverbanks."
