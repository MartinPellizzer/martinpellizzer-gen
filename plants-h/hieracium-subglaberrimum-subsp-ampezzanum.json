    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium subglaberrimum subsp. ampezzanum, commonly known as the Ampezzano hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
