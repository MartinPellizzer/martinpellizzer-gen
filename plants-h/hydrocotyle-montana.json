    "intro": "Hydrocotyle montana, commonly known as mountain spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically succulent and can store water, which helps it survive in dry conditions. Hydrocotyle montana is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, such as meadows and slopes."
