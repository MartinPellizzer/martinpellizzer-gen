    "intro": "Hebe rupicola, commonly known as the rock hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compact, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Hebe rupicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
