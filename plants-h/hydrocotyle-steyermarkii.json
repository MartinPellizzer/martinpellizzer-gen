    "intro": "Hydrocotyle steyermarkii, commonly known as the Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that remain just above the water surface, with fine, thread-like roots extending into the water. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered together, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Hydrocotyle steyermarkii is often found in ponds, lakes, and marshy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to a semi-aquatic lifestyle, with specialized leaves for photosynthesis and gas exchange."
