    "intro": "Hieracium subditivum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and it produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread easily and form dense mats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
