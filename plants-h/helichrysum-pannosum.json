It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small suns. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum pannosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in arid environments."
