    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. pseudoscorzonerifolium, commonly known as the false scorzonera hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which resembles that of the scorzonera genus. This subspecies is often found in high-altitude environments where it exhibits adaptations to cold and arid conditions."
