    "intro": "Hieracium lophophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, surrounded by pale green or white ray florets. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Hieracium lophophyllum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
