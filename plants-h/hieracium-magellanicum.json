It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
