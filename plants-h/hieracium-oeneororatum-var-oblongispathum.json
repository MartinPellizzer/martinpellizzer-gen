    "intro": "Hieracium oeneororatum var. oblongispathum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in a single terminal capitulum, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
