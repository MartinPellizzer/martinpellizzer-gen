    "intro": "Hieracium spathophyllum subsp. longatum, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head at the top of the stem. The subspecies longatum is distinguished by its longer flowering stem compared to other members of the spathophyllum group."
