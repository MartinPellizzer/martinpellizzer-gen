    "intro": "Hypoestes strobilifera var. tisserantii, commonly known as the Tisserant's flame plant, is a strikingly ornamental species native to South Africa. It features vibrant, flame-like red and orange inflorescences that contrast beautifully with its dark green, velvety leaves. The plant is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is prized for its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular in both garden settings and as a potted plant due to its visual appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
