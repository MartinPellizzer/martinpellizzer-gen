    "intro": "Huperzia apolinari-mariae, commonly known as the Mariae huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is native to specific regions in southern Africa. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophylls are arranged in a spiral pattern, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
