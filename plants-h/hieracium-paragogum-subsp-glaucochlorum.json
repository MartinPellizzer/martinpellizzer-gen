    "intro": "Hieracium paragogum subsp. glaucochlorum, commonly known as the blue-green hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in elongated inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves and stems are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in sunny environments."
