    "intro": "Hieracium antarctica f. fuegiensis, commonly known as the Antarctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the subantarctic region. It is characterized by its rosette-forming growth pattern and produces yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in harsh environments, including rocky soils and exposed coastal areas. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in cold, windy conditions. This subspecies is adapted to low temperatures and is often found in the Falkland Islands and South Georgia."
