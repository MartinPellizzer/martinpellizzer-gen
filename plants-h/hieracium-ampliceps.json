    "intro": "Hieracium ampliceps, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and its clusters of yellow to orange flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and can spread aggressively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday."
