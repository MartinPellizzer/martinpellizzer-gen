It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and often emerge from the base of the plant. Hippeastrum erectum is popular as a ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
