    "intro": "Heracleum pimpinellifolium, commonly known as the wild carrot or Queen Anne's lace, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and an umbrella-like inflorescence of white flowers with a single red floret in the center. The plant produces small, edible seeds that are often used in culinary applications. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Its distinctive appearance makes it both a common weed and a symbol of natural beauty in various regions."
