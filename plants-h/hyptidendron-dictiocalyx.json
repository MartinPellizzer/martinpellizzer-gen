    "intro": "Hyptidendron dictiocalyx, commonly known as the Brazilian rosewood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its wood is highly valued for its rich color and density, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. The species also has a distinctive root system that helps stabilize the soil in its native habitat."
