    "intro": "Henckelia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation to extreme climates. Henckelia tibetica is relatively rare and has limited distribution, which contributes to its ecological significance."
