    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. elongatifrons, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with a distinctive, elongated bloom. It is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated flower head and specific morphological traits compared to other Hieracium species."
