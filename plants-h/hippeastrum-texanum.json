    "intro": "Hippeastrum texanum, commonly known as the Texas amaryllis, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, white, and pink. The plant produces a tall, leafy stem that can reach up to 3 feet in height, with broad, strap-like leaves. Its bulbs are underground and store nutrients, allowing the plant to survive in arid conditions. Hippeastrum texanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
