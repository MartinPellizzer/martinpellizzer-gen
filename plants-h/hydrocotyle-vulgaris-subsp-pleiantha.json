    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris subsp. pleiantha, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features heart-shaped, floating or submerged leaves that are typically smooth and bright green. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can influence local aquatic ecosystems."
