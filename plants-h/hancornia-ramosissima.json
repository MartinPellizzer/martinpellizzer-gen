    "intro": "Hancornia ramosissima, commonly known as the desert willow, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, purple, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. Hancornia ramosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
