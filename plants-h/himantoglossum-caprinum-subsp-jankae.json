    "intro": "Himantoglossum caprinum subsp. jankae, commonly known as the Janka's bell heather, is a rare and specialized plant found in alpine environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, bell-shaped flowers. The subspecies is adapted to rocky and nutrient-poor soils, typical of high-altitude habitats. It produces violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
