    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. lasiophyllum, commonly known as the Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments where it can tolerate cold and harsh conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
