    "intro": "Hedera obtusiloba, commonly known as the blunt-leaf ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a slightly waxy texture. This plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in woodland areas. Hedera obtusiloba produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its adaptability and ornamental value make it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes."
