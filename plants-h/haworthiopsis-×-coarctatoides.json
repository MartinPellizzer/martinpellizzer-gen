    "intro": "Haworthiopsis \u00d7 coarctatoides, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a hybrid succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks bearing small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
