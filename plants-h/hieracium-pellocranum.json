It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in the summer, are surrounded by small, leaf-like bracts. Hieracium pellocranum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
