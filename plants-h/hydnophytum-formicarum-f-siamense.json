    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum f. siamense, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its specialized structures called \"domatia,\" which are hollow, chamber-like cavities on its stems that provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient cycling by tending to the plant's roots. The plant forms a mutualistic relationship with the ants, which also contribute to its pollination and seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important subject in studies of plant-ant interactions and tropical ecology."
