    "intro": "Hymenophyllum polyanthos var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaf hymenophyllum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with narrow, overlapping leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that help retain moisture. This variety is distinguished from the typical Hymenophyllum polyanthos by its smaller leaf size and more compact growth habit."
