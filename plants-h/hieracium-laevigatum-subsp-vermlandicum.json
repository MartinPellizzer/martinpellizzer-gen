    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. vermlandicum, commonly known as the Swedish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky areas. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on slender, branching stems. It is characterized by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
