    "intro": "Haumaniastrum speciosum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in sandy or rocky soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh desert conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration. Haumaniastrum speciosum plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals."
