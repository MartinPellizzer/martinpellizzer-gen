It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features upright, hairy stems and heart-shaped, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets surrounding a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as fruits. Hieracium filicaule is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils."
