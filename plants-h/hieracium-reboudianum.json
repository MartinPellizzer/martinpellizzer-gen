    "intro": "Hieracium reboudianum, commonly known as the Rebound hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated margin, and it produces small yellow flowers in clusters. Hieracium reboudianum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new habitats."
