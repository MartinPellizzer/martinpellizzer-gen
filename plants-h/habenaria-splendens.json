    "intro": "Habenaria splendens, commonly known as the Splendid Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that often display vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The orchid's structure includes a pseudobulb, which stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in less fertile conditions."
