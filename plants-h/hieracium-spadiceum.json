    "intro": "Hieracium spadiceum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often covered in white or pale green pubescence. It grows in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. Hieracium spadiceum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
