    "intro": "Hemionitis squamosa, commonly known as the mountain holly or stone holly, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and other mountainous regions. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions, making it well-suited to its alpine habitat. Hemionitis squamosa is often found in rocky crevices and among stony soils, where it thrives in full sun."
