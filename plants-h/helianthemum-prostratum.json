    "intro": "Helianthemum prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate sunflower or creeping rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry slopes. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in xeriscaping."
