    "intro": "Hieracium polytrichoides, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and often have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its ability to spread rapidly and compete with native vegetation."
