    "intro": "Haworthia subregularis, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the spring or early summer. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance requirements and unique appearance."
