    "intro": "Hieraciodes oliveriana, commonly known as the Oliver's rockweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in rocky habitats along the shoreline. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, fuzzy hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Hieraciodes oliveriana plays an important ecological role by stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
