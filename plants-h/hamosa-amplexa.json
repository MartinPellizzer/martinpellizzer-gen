    "intro": "Hamosa amplexa, commonly known as the climbing fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant features pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive clasping base that wraps around its support structure. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of the fern family. Hamosa amplexa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
