    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lanatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of fern native to Australia and New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in dense, fine hairs. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or acidic soils. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum lanatum is a small, delicate fern that plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
