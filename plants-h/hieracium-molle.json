    "intro": "Hieracium molle, commonly known as soft hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features soft, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
