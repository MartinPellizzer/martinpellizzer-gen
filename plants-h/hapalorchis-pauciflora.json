    "intro": "Hapalorchis pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or yellow in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid, shaded environments where it grows. Hapalorchis pauciflora is often found in forest understories, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions of the tropical rainforest."
