It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny fruit capsules that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces yellowish to greenish flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually lobed and hairy. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
