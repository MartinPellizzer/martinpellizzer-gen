It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet fragrance at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like moths. The fruit is a follicle that releases seeds with tufts of hair, aiding in wind dispersal."
