    "intro": "Horsfieldia fragillima, commonly known as the fragile orchid, is a small, epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments, where it derives moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. The plant has slender, wiry stems and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to retain water in its natural habitat. Horsfieldia fragillima is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
