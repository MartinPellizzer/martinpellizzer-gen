    "intro": "Halimium scabrosum, commonly known as the rough hound's tongue, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, wrinkled leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
