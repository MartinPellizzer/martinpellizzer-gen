    "intro": "Herpolirion capense, commonly known as the Cape herpolirion, is a small, evergreen shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. It is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Herpolirion capense is well adapted to dry, well-drained soils and requires minimal water once established."
