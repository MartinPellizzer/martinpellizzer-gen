    "intro": "Hedera \u00d7 schmidtii, commonly known as the Schmidt's ivy, is a hybrid species of ivy that originates from the cross between Hedera helix and Hedera rhombea. It is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by reddish-brown berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
