    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. pexum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations to the harsh environmental conditions of its habitat. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians."
