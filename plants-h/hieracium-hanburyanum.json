    "intro": "Hieracium hanburyanum, commonly known as Hanbury's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular disc florets. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
