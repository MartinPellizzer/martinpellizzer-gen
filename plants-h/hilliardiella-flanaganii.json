    "intro": "Hilliardiella flanaganii, commonly known as the Flanagan's hilliardiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. The plant has a compact, mat-like growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
