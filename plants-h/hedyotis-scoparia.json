    "intro": "Hedyotis scoparia, commonly known as the small marsh pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in temperate regions. It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Hedyotis scoparia is often found in association with other aquatic or semi-aquatic plants, thriving in areas with standing or slow-moving water. Its botanical structure supports its role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in wetland ecosystems."
