    "intro": "Hieracium heterocephalum, commonly known as the heterocephalous hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem, while the flowers consist of both ray and disk florets. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
