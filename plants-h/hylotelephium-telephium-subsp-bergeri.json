It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking pink to red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
