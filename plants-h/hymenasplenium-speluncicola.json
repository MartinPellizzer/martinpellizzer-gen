    "intro": "Hymenasplenium speluncicola, commonly known as the cave spleenwort, is a rare and specialized fern that thrives in dark, humid cave environments. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are adapted to low-light conditions. The plant is epiphytic, growing on the surfaces of cave walls or rock formations rather than in soil. Its unique morphology includes a short, creeping stem and specialized structures for water absorption in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for cave ecosystems."
