    "intro": "Haemocharis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed torch flower, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vivid orange-red bracts that surround its small, white flowers, creating a dramatic visual effect. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often glossy and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis angustifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant color and unique appearance."
