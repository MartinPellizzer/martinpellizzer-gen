It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by dark blue, berry-like fruits. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental appeal and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
