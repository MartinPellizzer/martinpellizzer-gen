    "intro": "Hansenia phaea, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring, followed by wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
