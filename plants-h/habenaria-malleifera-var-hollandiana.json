    "intro": "Habenaria malleifera var. hollandiana, commonly known as the Holland's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, grass-like leaves and produces striking, pendulous inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The flowers are often fragrant and attract various pollinators, including bees and flies."
