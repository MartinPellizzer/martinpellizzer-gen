    "intro": "Hoya exilis, commonly known as the \"Baby Lace Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a unique texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya exilis is a trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelf displays."
