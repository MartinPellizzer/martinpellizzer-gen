    "intro": "Hadrolaelia crispa f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered crinkled orchid, is a rare and elegant orchid species native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, crinkled leaves that give it its species name. The plant produces showy, white or pale pink flowers with a delicate, fragrant aroma, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cool, humid environments with partial shade and well-draining soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
