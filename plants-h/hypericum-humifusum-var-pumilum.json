It features small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has slender, woody stems that often lie close to the ground, forming a mat-like growth habit. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along streambanks."
