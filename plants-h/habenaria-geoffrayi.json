    "intro": "Habenaria geoffrayi, commonly known as the Geoffray's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients during dry periods. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it blooms during the warmer months. Habenaria geoffrayi is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
