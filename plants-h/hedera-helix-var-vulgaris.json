    "intro": "Hedera helix var. vulgaris, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a glossy texture and produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries. The plant is characterized by its ability to climb using aerial roots and can thrive in a variety of light conditions, though it prefers partial shade. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a popular choice for ornamental and hedging purposes. However, it can become invasive in certain environments if not managed properly."
