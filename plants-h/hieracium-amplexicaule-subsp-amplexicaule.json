    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. amplexicaule, commonly known as the clasping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves that clasp the stem, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
