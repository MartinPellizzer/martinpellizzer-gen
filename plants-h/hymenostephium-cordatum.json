    "intro": "Hymenostephium cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf hymenostephium, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive tubular shape. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped, giving it its common name, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and potential ecological roles."
