    "intro": "Hypolepis neocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian water fern, is a species of fern native to the island of New Caledonia. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a complex arrangement of small, lance-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in humid forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce adventitious roots, allowing it to anchor itself in wet soil. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
