    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 mansanetianum nothosubsp. mansanetianum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions, typical of its rocky, limestone-rich habitat. It is a hybrid between Helianthemum hirtum and Helianthemum manzanitense, exhibiting traits from both parents. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
