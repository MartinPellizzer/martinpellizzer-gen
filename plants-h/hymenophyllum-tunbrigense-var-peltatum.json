    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tunbrigense var. peltatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
