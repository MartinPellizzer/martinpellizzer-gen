    "intro": "Hemionitis brandtii, commonly known as the Brandt's hemionitis, is a unique aquatic fern native to the wetlands of China. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments and is characterized by its delicate, fan-shaped fronds that are often submerged or floating. The plant has a specialized root system that helps it anchor in soft, muddy substrates. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of ferns. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
