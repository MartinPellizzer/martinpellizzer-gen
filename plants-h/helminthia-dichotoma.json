    "intro": "Helminthia dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous helminthia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with slender, branched stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are opposite, narrow, and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Helminthia dichotoma is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
