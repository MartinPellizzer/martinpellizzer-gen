    "intro": "Hieracium microcolpodes, commonly known as the small-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in its native habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium microcolpodes is often found in meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
