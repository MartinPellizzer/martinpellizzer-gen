    "intro": "Hapalorchis candida, commonly known as the white liver fluke, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hapalorchidae. It is primarily found in the bile ducts of freshwater fish, particularly in the genus Cyprinidae. The adult fluke has a distinctive elongated body with a broad, flattened shape and a smooth, translucent tegument. Its life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and copepods, with the definitive host being various fish species. The parasite's morphology and reproductive structures are adapted for survival in the aquatic environment and for transmitting to its host through ingestion of infected prey."
