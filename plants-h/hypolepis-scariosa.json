It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive frond structure that features a central rachis and multiple pinnae. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are often covered in a thin, papery layer that aids in water retention.
