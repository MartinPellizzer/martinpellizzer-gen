    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus var. virgatus, commonly known as the silverleaf tansy, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and sagebrush steppe. Its leaves are silvery-gray due to a dense covering of fine hairs, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is adapted to arid environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its drought tolerance."
