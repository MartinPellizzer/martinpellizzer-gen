    "intro": "Helianthocereus poco var. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered night bloomer, is a cactus species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Its flowers emit a sweet fragrance, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. This species is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and hardy nature."
