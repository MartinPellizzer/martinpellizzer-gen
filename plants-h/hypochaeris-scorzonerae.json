It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by fluffy, seed-filled capsules.
