    "intro": "Hypolepis ekmanii, commonly known as the Ekman's water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically bipinnate. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from sori located on the underside of the fronds, which are grouped in clusters. Hypolepis ekmanii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
