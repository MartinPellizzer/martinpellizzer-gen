    "intro": "Habenaria petitiana, commonly known as the Petit's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to white in color. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that support its foliage and flowering structures. Its leaves are elongated and strap-like, often arranged in a dense rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Habenaria petitiana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
