It is characterized by its branching stems and small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in shallow coastal waters and is often found in sandy or rocky substrates. Its unique morphology allows it to withstand wave action and salinity, making it well adapted to intertidal zones. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal sediments and provides habitat for small marine organisms."
