    "intro": "Habenaria deistelii, commonly known as the Deistel's orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
