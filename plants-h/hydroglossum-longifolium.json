    "intro": "Hydroglossum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features slender, upright stems that can grow up to 30 inches tall, adorned with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often coated in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue to violet, which bloom in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems. Hydroglossum longifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
