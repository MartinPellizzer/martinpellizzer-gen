    "intro": "Haloragis gonocarpus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the shoreline. The plant features small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and arid conditions. Haloragis gonocarpus is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and supporting local biodiversity. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in coastal ecosystems."
