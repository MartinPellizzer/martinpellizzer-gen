It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal and form a rosette, while the stems are upright and branched. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellowish-orange petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
