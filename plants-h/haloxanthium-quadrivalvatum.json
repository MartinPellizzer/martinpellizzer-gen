    "intro": "Haloxanthium quadrivalvatum, commonly known as the four-lobed sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and its leaves are usually four-lobed, giving it its scientific name. It has adapted to survive in harsh environments through its succulent stems and reduced leaf surfaces. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soils in dry habitats."
