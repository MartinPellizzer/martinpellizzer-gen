    "intro": "Heracleum palmatifidum, commonly known as the broadleaf cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is native to the western United States. It is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which appear in the summer. Its stems are hollow and ridged, often with a purple tinge, and it has a strong, spicy odor similar to wild carrots. This plant is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
