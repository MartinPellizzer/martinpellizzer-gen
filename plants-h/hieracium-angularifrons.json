    "intro": "Hieracium angularifrons, commonly known as the angular-fronded hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, angular leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
