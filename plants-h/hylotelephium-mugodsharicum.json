    "intro": "Hylotelephium mugodsharicum, commonly known as the Mugodshar stonecrop, is a perennial succulent plant native to Central Asia. It features fleshy, upright stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late summer. It is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in alpine or steppe regions. Its succulent nature allows it to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens."
