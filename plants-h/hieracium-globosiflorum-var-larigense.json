It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces a single, large, yellow composite flower head. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils at high altitudes. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands.
