It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features basal and alternate leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from June to August. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, branched stems and reduced leaf hairs compared to other hawkweed species."
