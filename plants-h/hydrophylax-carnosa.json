    "intro": "Hydrophylax carnosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf waterplantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Hydrophylax carnosa is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
