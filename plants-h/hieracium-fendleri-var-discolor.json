    "intro": "Hieracium fendleri var. discolor, commonly known as the Mexican hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to orange in color. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
