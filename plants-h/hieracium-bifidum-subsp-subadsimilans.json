It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and alternate leaves that are lanceolate to narrowly elliptic in shape. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, ribbed achenes with pappus hairs, aiding in wind dispersal."
