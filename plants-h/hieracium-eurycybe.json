    "intro": "Hieracium eurycybe, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium eurycybe is often considered a weed but plays a role in pollinator support and soil stabilization."
