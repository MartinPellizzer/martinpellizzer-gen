    "intro": "Helicia, commonly known as the \"Indian chestnut\" or \"tree of life,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of approximately 100 species, predominantly found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. The plants are typically evergreen shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. Helicia species often thrive in shaded, moist environments and are adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Their fruit, a capsule, contains several seeds and is an important food source for various wildlife species."
