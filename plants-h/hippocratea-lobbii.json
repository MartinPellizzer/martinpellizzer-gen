    "intro": "Hippocratea lobbii, commonly known as the Lobb's hippocratea, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of western Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a distinctive yellow and purple coloration. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, playing a role in its reproductive cycle. Due to habitat loss, Hippocratea lobbii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
