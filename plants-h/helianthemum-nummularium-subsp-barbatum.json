    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. barbatum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of hairy stems, setting it apart from other members of the species."
