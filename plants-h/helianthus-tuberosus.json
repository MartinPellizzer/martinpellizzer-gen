    "intro": "Helianthus tuberosus, commonly known as Jerusalem artichoke, is a perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tuberous roots that are edible and rich in inulin. The plant produces yellow flowers similar to those of sunflowers, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is drought-tolerant and often used in permaculture due to its hardiness. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
