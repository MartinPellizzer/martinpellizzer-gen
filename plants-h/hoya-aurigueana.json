    "intro": "Hoya aurigueana, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or coral in color, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya aurigueana is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
