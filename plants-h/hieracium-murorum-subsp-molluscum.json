    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. molluscum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. Its flowering period occurs from June to August, and it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings. The subspecies molluscum is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
