    "intro": "Hydrocotyle peduncularis, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are typically rounded and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, a feature common in the Araliaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive. Hydrocotyle peduncularis plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
