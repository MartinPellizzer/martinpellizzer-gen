    "intro": "Hieracium fuscidulum, commonly known as the pale yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flower heads, which consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Hieracium fuscidulum is an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
