    "intro": "Hakea pteridifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Hakea pteridifolia is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that reduce water loss. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
