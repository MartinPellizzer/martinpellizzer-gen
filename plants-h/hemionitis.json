    "intro": "Hemionitis, commonly known as the waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic fern native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves, which resemble the spokes of a wheel. The plant thrives in shallow, still water and is often found in marshy environments. Its fronds are typically submerged or floating, and they play a role in stabilizing the sediment in its habitat. Hemionitis is known for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels and is sometimes used in water gardens."
