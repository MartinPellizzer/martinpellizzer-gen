It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often overlooked in the wild."
