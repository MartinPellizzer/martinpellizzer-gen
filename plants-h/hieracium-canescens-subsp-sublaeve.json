    "intro": "Hieracium canescens subsp. sublaeve, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively. The subspecies sublaeve is distinguished by its more rounded and less hairy leaves compared to other forms of Hieracium canescens."
