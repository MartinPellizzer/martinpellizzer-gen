    "intro": "Hymenophyllum hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has delicate, lace-like fronds covered in fine, hairy scales, which help it retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or on tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum hirsutum is characterized by its unique morphology and adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
