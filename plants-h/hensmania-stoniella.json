    "intro": "Hensmania stoniella, commonly known as the stone lily, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of South America. This small, terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its flowers are characterized by their delicate, white petals and a distinctive yellowish lip, which is a key feature in orchid identification. The plant produces a unique, fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators, such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hensmania stoniella is considered a rare and endangered species."
