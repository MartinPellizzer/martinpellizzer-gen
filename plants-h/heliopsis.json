    "intro": "Heliopsis, commonly known as the \"sunflower\" of the Asteraceae family, is a genus of flowering plants native to North America. It features bright, showy yellow to orange flowers that resemble those of the sunflower, though they are smaller and more daisy-like in structure. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies, meadows, and woodland edges, thriving in full sun. Heliopsis species have lance-shaped leaves and produce numerous seeds in their composite flower heads. They are popular in gardens for their vibrant color and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
