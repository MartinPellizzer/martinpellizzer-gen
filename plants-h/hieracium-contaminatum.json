    "intro": "Hieracium contaminatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium contaminatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
