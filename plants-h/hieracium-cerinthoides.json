    "intro": "Hieracium cerinthoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom from June to September, are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. Hieracium cerinthoides is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
