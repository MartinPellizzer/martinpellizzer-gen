    "intro": "Helianthus ultiflorus, commonly known as the tall goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its tall, branching stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist to wet soil conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy texture, while its flowers bloom in late summer to early fall. Helianthus ultiflorus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
