    "intro": "Huperzia rigida, commonly known as the rigid huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, scale-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of the stems. Huperzia rigida is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
