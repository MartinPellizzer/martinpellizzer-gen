    "intro": "Hesperis balansae f. scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous helenia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, scabrous leaves and small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in alpine or subalpine regions. It is native to specific areas in the Mediterranean and has limited distribution. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
