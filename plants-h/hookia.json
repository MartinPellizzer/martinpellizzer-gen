    "intro": "Hookia, commonly known as the hook fern, is a member of the Davalliaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, curved fronds that resemble hooks. It is a tropical plant native to regions such as Southeast Asia, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, attaching itself to trees or rocks in humid environments. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, while the spore-producing structures are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hookia thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found in rainforests or coastal areas."
