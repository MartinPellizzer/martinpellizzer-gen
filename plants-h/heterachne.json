    "intro": "Heterachne, commonly known as the false panicgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plants typically have narrow, flat leaves and are found in a variety of habitats, including dry grasslands and disturbed soils. Heterachne species are often used in ecological studies due to their adaptability and role in soil stabilization. Their botanical features make them important in both agricultural and ornamental contexts."
