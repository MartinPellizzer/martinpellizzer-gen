    "intro": "Hieracium argaeoloides, commonly known as the Argaeoloid dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that develop into fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the dandelion genus. It has rough, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and its stems are usually erect and branched. Hieracium argaeoloides is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
