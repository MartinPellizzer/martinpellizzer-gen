    "intro": "Helianthemum canum subsp. incanum, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of hair, helping to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
