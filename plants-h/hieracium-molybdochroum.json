    "intro": "Hieracium molybdochroum, commonly known as the molybdenum dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to greenish flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. It is known for its ability to accumulate heavy metals, particularly molybdenum, which gives it its common name. This trait makes it useful in phytoremediation efforts for contaminated soils."
