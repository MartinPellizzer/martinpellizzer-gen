It is characterized by its narrow, silver-colored leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of dense, spike-like clusters of small, wind-pollinated flowers. Hypargyrium subrectum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
