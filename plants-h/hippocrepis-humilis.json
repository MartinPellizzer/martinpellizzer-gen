    "intro": "Hippocrepis humilis, commonly known as the small helmet orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, fragrant blossoms during the spring season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
