    "intro": "Helleborus chinensis, commonly known as Chinese hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to China. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shady, moist woodland areas and is known for its toxic properties due to the presence of cardiac glycosides. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable habitats. Helleborus chinensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its historical use in traditional medicine."
