    "intro": "Haplopappus venetus subsp. tridentatus, commonly known as the three-toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and slender, upright stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by bracts with three distinct teeth. It is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soils and limited water conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other members of the genus."
