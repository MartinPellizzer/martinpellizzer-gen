    "intro": "Hydrocera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water plantain, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that float on the water surface or rise from the substrate. Its small, white flowers appear in dense spikes and are often pollinated by insects. Hydrocera angustifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing water bodies."
