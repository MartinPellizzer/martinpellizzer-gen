    "intro": "Haplopappus gracilis, commonly known as the slender pappus, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and rocky slopes. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by feathery pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of seeds. Haplopappus gracilis is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
