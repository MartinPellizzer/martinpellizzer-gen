    "intro": "Hieracium caperatum, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium caperatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
