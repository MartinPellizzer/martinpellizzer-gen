    "intro": "Hypoestes insularis, commonly known as the \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 feet, with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered, but the showy bracts are the main ornamental feature. Hypoestes insularis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
