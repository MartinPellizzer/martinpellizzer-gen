    "intro": "Hypertelis fragilis, commonly known as the brittle tree, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its delicate, papery leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its fragility, it is relatively rare and faces threats from habitat loss and environmental changes."
