    "intro": "Hevea duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's rubber tree, is a species native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 20 meters in height. The plant is characterized by its elliptical, leathery leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers. Its latex, similar to that of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), has been studied for potential industrial uses. However, it is less commercially significant than its more well-known relative."
