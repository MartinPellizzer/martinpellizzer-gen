    "intro": "Hypericum perfoliatum var. richterianum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a reddish or purplish tinge, especially in the autumn. Its small yellow flowers, which appear in summer, are clustered in cymes and have five petals. This variety is notable for its adaptability to rocky and dry soils, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens."
