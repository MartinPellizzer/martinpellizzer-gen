It is a medium-sized palm characterized by its clustered growth habit and stiff, sword-shaped leaves. The plant produces large, spadix-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers. Its fruits are clustered and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by animals. The trunk is typically covered with a fibrous, leafy sheath, giving it a distinctive appearance."
