    "intro": "Hakea masonii, commonly known as the Mason's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and its striking, cone-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces small, bright red or orange flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea masonii is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient plant in harsh environments."
