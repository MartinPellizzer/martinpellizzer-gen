    "intro": "Holosteum alsine, commonly known as common sandparsley, is a low-growing annual plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It has slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground, and its small, opposite leaves are typically lance-shaped with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, round seeds enclosed in a pithy capsule. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and along riverbanks. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique leaf structure and the presence of a basal rosette in some varieties."
