    "intro": "Homalium dananense, commonly known as the Danan mountain hibiscus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the mountainous areas of Vietnam and Laos. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to red, and its broad, heart-shaped leaves. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
