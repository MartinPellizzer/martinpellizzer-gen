    "intro": "Hemerocallis dumortieri var. esculenta, commonly known as the edible daylily, is a variant of the daylily genus native to China. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant is herbaceous, with strap-like leaves and a short, rhizomatous root system. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only one day, hence the genus name \"Hemerocallis,\" meaning \"day flower.\" The plant is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its edible parts, including the young shoots and flower buds, which are used in Chinese cuisine."
