    "intro": "Heliotropium cupressinum, commonly known as the creeping heliotrope, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy texture. Heliotropium cupressinum is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
