    "intro": "Hesperostipa curtiseta, commonly known as the curly hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and distinctive, curly, silver-gray leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically greenish to brownish in color. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and along rocky slopes. Hesperostipa curtiseta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
