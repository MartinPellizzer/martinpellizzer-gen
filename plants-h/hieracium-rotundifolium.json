    "intro": "Hieracium rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are broadly rounded and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
