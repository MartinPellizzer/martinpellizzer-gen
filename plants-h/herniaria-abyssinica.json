    "intro": "Herniaria abyssinica, commonly known as the Abyssinian sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with five petals and a distinctive central structure. Herniaria abyssinica is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
