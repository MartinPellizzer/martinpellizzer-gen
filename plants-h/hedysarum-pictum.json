    "intro": "Hedysarum pictum, commonly known as the painted vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with finely toothed edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender, hairy pods that mature in the fall. Hedysarum pictum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing capabilities."
