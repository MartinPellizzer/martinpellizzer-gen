    "intro": "Homalotrichon pubescens, commonly known as the hairy meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, wetlands, and stream banks. The plant features slender, erect stems with a dense covering of short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaf blades are narrow and slightly rolled, and the inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
