    "intro": "Hymenophyllum brevistipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its translucent, ribbon-like fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum brevistipes is adapted to humid environments and is often found in shaded, high-altitude habitats."
