    "intro": "Hemiphlebium, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, overlapping, scalloped leaves that resemble a cloak or mantle, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Hemiphlebium species are known for their delicate, fern-like fronds and produce small, yellowish spore-bearing structures called sori. It is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
