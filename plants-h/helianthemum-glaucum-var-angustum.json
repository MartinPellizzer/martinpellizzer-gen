    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. angustum, commonly known as narrowleaf sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Europe. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to retain water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscapes."
