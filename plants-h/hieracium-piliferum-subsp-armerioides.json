    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum subsp. armerioides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flowering habits. It is often found in open habitats and is relatively common in its native range."
