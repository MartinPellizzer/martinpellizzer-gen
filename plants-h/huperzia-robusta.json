It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery leaves that are often spirally arranged along the stem. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in specialized structures called synangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia robusta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
