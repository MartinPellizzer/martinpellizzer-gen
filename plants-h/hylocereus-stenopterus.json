It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces striking white or pale pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its fruit, often referred to as a \"dragon fruit,\" is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. The plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
