    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the Pyrenees region. It features a tall, hollow stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, often with a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of the Apiaceae family. This variant is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact inflorescence compared to the typical form of Heracleum sphondylium."
