    "intro": "Hieracium meppelense, commonly known as Meppel's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in the Netherlands and parts of Germany. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Hieracium meppelense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
