    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor var. fuscus, commonly known as the dark-stemmed night-blooming cereus, is a cacti species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, fragrant, white flowers at night. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick stems that store water and reduce transpiration. Its flowers open in response to darkness, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The varietal name *fuscus* refers to its darker stem coloration compared to the typical variety."
