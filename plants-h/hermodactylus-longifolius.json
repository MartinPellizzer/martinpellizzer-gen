    "intro": "Hermodactylus longifolius, commonly known as the long-leaved hermodactyl, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbrella-like structures. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract beneficial insects. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
