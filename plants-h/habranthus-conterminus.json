It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal and arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and resilience, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climates."
