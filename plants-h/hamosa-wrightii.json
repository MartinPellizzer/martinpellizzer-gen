It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or white. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a rough texture, while its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature.
