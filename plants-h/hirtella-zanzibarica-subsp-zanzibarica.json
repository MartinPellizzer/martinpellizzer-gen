    "intro": "Hirtella zanzibarica subsp. zanzibarica, commonly known as the Zanzibar hirtella, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in the rainy season. It thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and near the sea. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
