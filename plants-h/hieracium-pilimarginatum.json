    "intro": "Hieracium pilimarginatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and stems that bear yellow to orange-red flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are tubular and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Hieracium pilimarginatum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
