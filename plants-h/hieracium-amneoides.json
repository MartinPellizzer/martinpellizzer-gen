    "intro": "Hieracium amneoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Its yellow flowers consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium amneoides is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
