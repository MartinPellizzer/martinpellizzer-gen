    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. primierense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in dense, white to pale yellow hairs. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in high-altitude environments where it tolerates cold and harsh conditions."
