    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subprotractifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The leaves are elongated, narrow, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
