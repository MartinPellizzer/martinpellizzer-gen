    "intro": "Hieracium flomense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium flomense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize new areas rapidly."
