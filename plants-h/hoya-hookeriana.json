    "intro": "Hoya hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia and Malaysia, and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in response to changes in light and temperature. Hoya hookeriana is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor environments."
