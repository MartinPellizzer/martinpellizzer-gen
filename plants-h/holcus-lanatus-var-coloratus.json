    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. coloratus, commonly known as the purple moor grass, is a variant of the common moor grass characterized by its distinctive purple inflorescence. It is a perennial grass species native to the British Isles and parts of Europe, typically found in moist, acidic grassland habitats. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces dense, spike-like flower clusters that bloom in early summer. Its vibrant purple coloration makes it a visually striking component of its native ecosystems. It plays a role in maintaining biodiversity by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates."
