    "intro": "Hedysarum reniforme, commonly known as the kidneyleaf peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its kidney-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind. Hedysarum reniforme plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
