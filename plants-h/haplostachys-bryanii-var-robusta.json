    "intro": "Haplostachys bryanii var. robusta, commonly known as the robust bryan grass, is a perennial grass species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, spikelet-like flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for erosion control and as a component of native plant communities."
