    "intro": "Hoya spartioides, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a trailing or climbing plant with thick, fleshy stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy, coral-pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a glossy, dark green surface. Hoya spartioides is well-suited for hanging baskets or as a trailing plant in greenhouses due to its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements."
