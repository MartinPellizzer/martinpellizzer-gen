    "intro": "Hermione calliopsis, commonly known as the moonshade orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pale blue flowers that resemble the moon's surface. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its leaves are broad and velvety, often with a subtle silver sheen that reflects light. Due to its endangered status, it is highly sought after by botanists and conservationists alike."
