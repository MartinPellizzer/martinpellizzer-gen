    "intro": "Himantoglossum longibracteatum var. gallicum, commonly known as the French marsh orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its long, bract-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. The plant is typically found in peat bogs and fens, where it forms dense colonies. Its morphology includes a slender stem and a single, showy flower per stem, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this variety is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
