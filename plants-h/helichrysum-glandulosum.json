    "intro": "Helichrysum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a sticky texture and help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The flowers are often used in traditional medicine and are also popular in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color."
