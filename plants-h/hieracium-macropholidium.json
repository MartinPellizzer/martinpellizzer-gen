    "intro": "Hieracium macropholidium, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has a rosette of broad, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It spreads primarily through rhizomes and can form dense colonies, often in meadows and disturbed soils. Botanically, it belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its composite flower heads."
