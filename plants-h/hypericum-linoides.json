    "intro": "Hypericum linoides, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, woody stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. Hypericum linoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover."
