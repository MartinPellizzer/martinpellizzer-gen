    "intro": "Hymenopappus douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's tawny dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and distinctive pappus structures. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are alternate, hairy, and lance-shaped, while its stems are erect and often branched. The seeds are dispersed by wind, aided by the feathery pappus that attaches to the fruit."
