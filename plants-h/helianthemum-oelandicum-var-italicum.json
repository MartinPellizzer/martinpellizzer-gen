It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style landscaping."
