    "intro": "Humboldtia brunonis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences at the base of the leaves. Humboldtia brunonis is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
