    "intro": "Heterocaryum echinophorum, commonly known as the spiked burrgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its clustered, spiny seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in prairie and woodland habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The spiky structure of its seeds aids in dispersal by attaching to animals or clothing."
