    "intro": "Heliotropium vierhapperi, commonly known as the dwarf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean islands. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
