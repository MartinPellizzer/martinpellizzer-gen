    "intro": "Helianthus longiradiatus, commonly known as the long-rayed sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and is characterized by its large, showy yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features long, narrow leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by numerous ray florets, which are often more elongated than those of other sunflower species. Helianthus longiradiatus is adapted to thrive in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy and resilient plant in its native habitat."
