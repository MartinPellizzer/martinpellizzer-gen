    "intro": "Hypolytrum sylvaticum, commonly known as the forest lily, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and thickets. The plant features strap-like, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a spike. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Hypolytrum sylvaticum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
