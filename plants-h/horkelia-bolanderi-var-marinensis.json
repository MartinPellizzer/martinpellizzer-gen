    "intro": "Horkelia bolanderi var. marinensis, commonly known as Bolander's horkelia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, blue-green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to the harsh, maritime climate of its native habitat. It is often found in dunes or along the edges of coastal scrub communities. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
