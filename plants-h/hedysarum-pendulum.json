    "intro": "Hedysarum pendulum, commonly known as the weeping vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its drooping, cascading clusters of small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets and produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Native to regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum pendulum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding plants."
