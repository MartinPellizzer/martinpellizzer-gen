    "intro": "Hedyotis subscandens, commonly known as the creeping bluet, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
