    "intro": "Hypochaeris ornata, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and features hairy, alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in gardens. Hypochaeris ornata is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
