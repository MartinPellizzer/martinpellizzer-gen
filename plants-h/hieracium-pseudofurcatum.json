    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofurcatum, commonly known as the false forked hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss in its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
