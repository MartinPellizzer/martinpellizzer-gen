    "intro": "Heynea trijuga var. velutina, commonly known as the velvetleaf sycamore, is a variant of the species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree characterized by its smooth, grey bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
