    "intro": "Hieracium tephrodermum subsp. tephrodermum, commonly known as the tephrodermum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments, making it a common indicator of disturbed or early successional habitats."
