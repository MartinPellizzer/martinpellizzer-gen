    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina var. sajanensis, commonly known as the Sajansky bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces slender, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
