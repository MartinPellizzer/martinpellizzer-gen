It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves and small, spikelet-based inflorescences. This plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats. The species is also of interest in ecological and agricultural research due to its resilience and potential for forage use."
