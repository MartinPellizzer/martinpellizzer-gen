    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. strictum, commonly known as the upright sandverbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other varieties of Helianthemum pilosum."
