    "intro": "Helianthemum molle, commonly known as the soft stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Helianthemum molle is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and adaptability."
