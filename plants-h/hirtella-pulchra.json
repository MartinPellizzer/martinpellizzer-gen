    "intro": "Hirtella pulchra, commonly known as the pink hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red berries. Hirtella pulchra thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
