    "intro": "Horkelia scandularis, commonly known as the sticky horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, sticky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Horkelia scandularis is often found in open habitats such as meadows and along stream banks."
