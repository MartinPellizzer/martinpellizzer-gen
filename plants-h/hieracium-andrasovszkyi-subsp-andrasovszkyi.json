    "intro": "Hieracium andrasovszkyi subsp. andrasovszkyi, commonly known as the Andrasovszky's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant typically features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and is often found in moist or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
