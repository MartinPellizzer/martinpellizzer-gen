    "intro": "Hypericum androsaemoides, commonly known as the yellow hypericum or creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant has woody stems that form a dense mat, making it suitable for ground cover in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. The plant contains bioactive compounds, including hypericin and pseudohypericin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties."
