    "intro": "Hymenasplenium unilaterale var. rahaoense, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a variant of the holly fern genus native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a compact, upright form. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with spores produced on the underside of the leaves. This variant is notable for its unique leaf morphology and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in humid climates."
