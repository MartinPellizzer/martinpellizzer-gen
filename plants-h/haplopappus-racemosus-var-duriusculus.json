It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and often hairy or rough surfaces. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine, stiff hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a raceme, contributing to its ornamental value in dry landscapes."
