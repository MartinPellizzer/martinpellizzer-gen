    "intro": "Hieracium canisquamum, commonly known as the dog's-queens' weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium canisquamum is often considered a weed but has ecological value by providing food for pollinators."
