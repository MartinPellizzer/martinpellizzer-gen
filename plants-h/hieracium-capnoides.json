    "intro": "Hieracium capnoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many species in the genus Hieracium. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
