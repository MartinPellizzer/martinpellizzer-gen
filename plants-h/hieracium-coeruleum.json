It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its blue to purple flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium coeruleum is often found in open habitats and can form dense colonies, contributing to the ecological diversity of its environment."
