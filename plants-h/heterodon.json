    "intro": "Heterodon, commonly known as the horned toad, is a genus of lizard belonging to the family Phrynosomatidae. These reptiles are characterized by their distinctive, bumpy, and often horn-like protrusions on their heads and bodies. They are primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of North America. Heterodon species are known for their ability to camouflage effectively in their desert environments. Their botanical aspects are less relevant, as they are not plants, but their ecological role in desert ecosystems is significant."
