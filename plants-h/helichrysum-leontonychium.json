    "intro": "Helichrysum leontonychium, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense clusters, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Helichrysum leontonychium is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant colors."
