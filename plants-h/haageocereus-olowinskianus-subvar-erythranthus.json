    "intro": "Haageocereus olowinskianus subvar. erythranthus, commonly known as the red-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in tubercles. The plant produces vibrant red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
