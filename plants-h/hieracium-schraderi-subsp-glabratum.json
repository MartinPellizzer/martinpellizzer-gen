    "intro": "Hieracium schraderi subsp. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. It has smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other hawkweed species. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
