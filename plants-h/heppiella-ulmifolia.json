    "intro": "Heppiella ulmifolia, commonly known as the elm-leaved heppiella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of elm trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Heppiella ulmifolia is generally herbaceous, with a short stature and a preference for moist, well-drained soils."
