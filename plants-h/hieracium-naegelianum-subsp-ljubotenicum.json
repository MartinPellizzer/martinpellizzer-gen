    "intro": "Hieracium naegelianum subsp. ljubotenicum, commonly known as the Ljubotenic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, dandelion-like flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat."
