    "intro": "Hypolytrum stemonifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hypolytrum, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many species adapted to arid and coastal environments. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy soils and rocky areas. Its leaves are broad and sword-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are small and clustered, usually in dense inflorescences, and bloom in late spring or early summer."
