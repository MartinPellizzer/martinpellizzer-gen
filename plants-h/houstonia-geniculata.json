    "intro": "Houstonia geniculata, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine flatwoods. Its low-growing habit and delicate appearance make it a notable component of native plant communities."
