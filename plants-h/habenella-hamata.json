    "intro": "Habenella hamata, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its inflated, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often reduced to small, scale-like structures, while the bladders are the primary photosynthetic organs. Habenella hamata is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to trap and digest prey, supplementing its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
