    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. stenotaeniceps, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the broader H. murorum species."
