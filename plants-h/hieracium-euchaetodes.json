    "intro": "Hieracium euchaetodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers. It is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
