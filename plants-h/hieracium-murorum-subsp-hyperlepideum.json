    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. hyperlepideum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
