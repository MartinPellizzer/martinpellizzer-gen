    "intro": "Heterotheca lamarckii, commonly known as the Lamarck's goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the central and southern regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and is commonly referred to as the sunflower family. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Heterotheca lamarckii is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and adaptability to various environmental conditions."
