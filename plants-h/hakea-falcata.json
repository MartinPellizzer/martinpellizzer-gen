    "intro": "Hakea falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern and south-eastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea falcata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
