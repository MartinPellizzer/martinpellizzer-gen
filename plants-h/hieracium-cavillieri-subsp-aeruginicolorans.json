    "intro": "Hieracium cavillieri subsp. aeruginicolorans, commonly known as the blue-green hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters. Its leaves and stems are often covered with a distinctive blue-green or purplish hue due to the presence of glandular hairs. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dry, sunny environments."
