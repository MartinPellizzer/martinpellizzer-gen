    "intro": "Helianthemum thymifolium var. strictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an ideal choice for xeriscaping."
