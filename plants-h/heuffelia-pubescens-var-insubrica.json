    "intro": "Heuffelia pubescens var. insubrica, commonly known as the hairy heuffelia, is a rare and lesser-known member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely pubescent stems and leaves, which are often covered in a soft, white down. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in woodland understories. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are arranged in umbels, a common feature among members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and of interest to botanists and conservationists."
