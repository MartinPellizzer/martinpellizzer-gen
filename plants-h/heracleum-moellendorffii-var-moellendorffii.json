    "intro": "Heracleum moellendorffii var. moellendorffii, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface and a strong, unpleasant odor. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by seed pods that split open to release flat, winged seeds. It is characterized by its thick, hollow stems with purple spots and coarse hairs. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can cause severe skin irritation."
