    "intro": "Hydnora, commonly known as the \"corpse flower,\" is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host for nutrients. The plant is notable for its unique, odorless flowers that emit a strong, decaying flesh scent to attract pollinators like flies. Hydnora is native to arid regions of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where it thrives in harsh, dry environments. Its reproductive strategy is highly specialized, with flowers opening only at night and blooming infrequently, often going unnoticed by humans."
