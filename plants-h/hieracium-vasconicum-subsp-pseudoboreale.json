    "intro": "Hieracium vasconicum subsp. pseudoboreale, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of northern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in elongated inflorescences. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Compositae) and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
