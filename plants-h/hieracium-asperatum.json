    "intro": "Hieracium asperatum, commonly known as rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
