    "intro": "Helianthemum humile, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean gardens."
