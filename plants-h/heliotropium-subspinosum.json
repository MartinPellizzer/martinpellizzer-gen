    "intro": "Heliotropium subspinosum, commonly known as the spiny heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or subshrub with erect or spreading stems that are often sparsely to densely hairy. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a pubescent surface. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink or purple, blooming in summer, and are borne on short pedicels. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
