    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocorymbosum subsp. aquileiense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils. It is often found in meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
