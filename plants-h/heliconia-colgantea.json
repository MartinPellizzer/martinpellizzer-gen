    "intro": "Heliconia colgantea, commonly known as the hanging heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences that resemble a crown or a torch. The plant features elongated, strap-like leaves that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. Its flowers are typically orange or red, with a unique structure that houses small, clustered flowers within a fleshy, spathaceous bract. Heliconia colgantea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or near coastal areas."
