    "intro": "Heterocoma bifrons, commonly known as the two-sided heterocoma, is a species of flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in dry conditions, and its leaves are often covered in fine hairs. Heterocoma bifrons is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
