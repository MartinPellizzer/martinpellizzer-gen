    "intro": "Hieracium subalpinum subsp. submacilentum, commonly known as the subalpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. The plant features dark green, broadly ovate leaves with a hairy underside and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions. This subspecies is adapted to harsh alpine environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in such ecosystems."
