    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum f. alpinicola, commonly known as the alpine thrift, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, adding a vibrant splash of color to rocky slopes and meadows. It is well adapted to poor, well-drained soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ability to withstand cold temperatures make it a popular choice for alpine and coastal gardens."
