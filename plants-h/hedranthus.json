    "intro": "Hedranthus, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to the Andes Mountains in South America. These plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Hedranthus species are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in rocky or high-altitude environments. They produce capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a rough or hairy texture."
