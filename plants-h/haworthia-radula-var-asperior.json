    "intro": "Haworthia radula var. asperior, commonly known as the rock pine or asperior haworthia, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the cooler months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
