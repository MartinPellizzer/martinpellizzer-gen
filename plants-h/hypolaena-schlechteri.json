    "intro": "Hypolaena schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's spider orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the tropical rainforests of New Guinea. It is characterized by its unique, spider-like appearance, with long, slender petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
