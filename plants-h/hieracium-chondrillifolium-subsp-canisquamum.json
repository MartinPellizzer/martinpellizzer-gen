    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. canisquamum, commonly known as the dog's-queen's-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and the presence of a distinct leaf base that clasps the stem. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of Europe."
