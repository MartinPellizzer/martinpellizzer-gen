    "intro": "Hieracium armerioides subsp. phalacrophyllum, commonly known as the sea hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in salty and windy conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the flower heads are composed of many small florets. It is well adapted to coastal environments, with a deep root system that helps stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
