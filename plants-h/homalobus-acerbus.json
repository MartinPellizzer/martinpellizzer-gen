    "intro": "Homalobus acerbus, commonly known as the slender spurge, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which is characterized by its production of milky sap. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has simple, alternate leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated but is occasionally found in wildflower gardens."
