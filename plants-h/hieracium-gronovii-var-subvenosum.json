    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii var. subvenosum, commonly known as the Greenland hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture and prominent veins. This variant is distinguished by its sub-veined leaf structure, which sets it apart from other Hieracium species. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as tundra and rocky slopes."
