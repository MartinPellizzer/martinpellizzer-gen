    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. killiasii, commonly known as the Killias' hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its erect stems, which can reach up to 30 centimeters in height, and its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves. Its inflorescence consists of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude environments."
