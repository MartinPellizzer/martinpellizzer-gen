    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the chalk hill sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found on rocky or sandy slopes. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well adapted to arid and coastal environments."
