    "intro": "Helianthus dissectifolius subsp. trifurcatus, commonly known as the three-branch sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive and ecologically valuable plant for wetland restoration projects."
