    "intro": "Hydrostachys trifaria var. multisquamata, commonly known as the silverleaf daisy, is a low-growing, succulent perennial native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers surrounded by narrow, silver-green leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming a mat-like structure that helps it thrive in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and drought tolerance. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
