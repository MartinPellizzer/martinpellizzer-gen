It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact form and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
