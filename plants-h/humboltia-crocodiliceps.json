    "intro": "Humboltia crocodiliceps, commonly known as the crocodile-head plant, is a striking member of the Apocynaceae family native to the humid forests of South America. This evergreen shrub is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, providing it with a unique, almost velvety texture. Its most distinctive feature is its large, showy flowers, which are typically orange or red with a prominent, curling lip that resembles a crocodile's mouth. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, toxic seeds, a trait common among members of its family. Humboltia crocodiliceps thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing in the understory of tropical rainforests."
