    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum var. scotocranum, commonly known as the Scottish bent thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in grassy areas, heaths, and along coastal regions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are spiny and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more elongated and less hairy. Its flowers are yellow and appear in a single head, surrounded by pale green bracts. This variety is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptation to its native habitat."
