    "intro": "Hymenophyllum mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often used in horticultural displays due to its aesthetic appeal."
