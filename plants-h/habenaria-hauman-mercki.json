    "intro": "Habenaria hauman-mercki, commonly known as the Merck's butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that resemble butterflies, with a distinctive lip that is usually yellow or orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers during the wet season. This orchid is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
