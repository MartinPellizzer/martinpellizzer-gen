    "intro": "Hieracium briquetianum, commonly known as the Briquet's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets that resemble dandelion petals, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and often protected species in many regions."
