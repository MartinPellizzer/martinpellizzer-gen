    "intro": "Hedyotis yapensis, commonly known as the Yap bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Yap and nearby atolls. It is a low-growing herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom throughout the year, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are small, three-lobed capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Hedyotis yapensis is adapted to coastal and sandy environments, showing resilience to salt spray and limited soil nutrients."
