    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. truncipilum, commonly known as the short-petaled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant has alternate, basal leaves that are lanceolate to ovate in shape, with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the petals are shorter than those of the typical H. vulgatum. It is characterized by its reduced flower structure and is often found in moist or calcareous soils."
