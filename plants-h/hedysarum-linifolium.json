    "intro": "Hedysarum linifolium, commonly known as the slender vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, trifoliate leaves with linear lobes. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated pods containing several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and slopes. Hedysarum linifolium plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
