    "intro": "Henckelia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland environments in South America. It features a horizontal stoloniferous growth habit, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Henckelia stolonifera plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland areas and supporting local biodiversity."
