    "intro": "Hymenophyllum farallonense, commonly known as the Farallon fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like fronds and is typically found growing on rocky substrates in humid, shaded environments. The plant has a unique ability to thrive in high-altitude and coastal areas, often in regions with frequent mist or sea spray. Its spores are produced in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, velvety patches on the underside of its fronds. This species is particularly adapted to nutrient-poor environments, making it a rare and specialized member of the fern flora."
