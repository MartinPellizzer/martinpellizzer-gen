    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. hemibifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowering heads are composite, consisting of yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets, which bloom from June to August. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow leaf shape and the presence of a distinct, narrow secondary lobing on the leaf margins."
