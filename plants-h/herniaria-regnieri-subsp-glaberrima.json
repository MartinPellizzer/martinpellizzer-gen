It is characterized by its prostrate habit, with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed sites. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
