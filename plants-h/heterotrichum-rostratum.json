    "intro": "Heterotrichum rostratum, commonly known as the rostrate moss, is a species of acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and the presence of distinctive, rostrate (beak-like) capsules. The leaves are typically elongated and gradually tapering, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. This moss thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures are enclosed in operculate capsules, which release spores when mature."
