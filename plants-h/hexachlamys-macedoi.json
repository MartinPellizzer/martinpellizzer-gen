    "intro": "Hexachlamys macedoi, commonly known as the Macedonian hexachlamys, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, complex inflorescence. The plant features a tall, slender stem with a single umbel of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, similar to other members of its family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
