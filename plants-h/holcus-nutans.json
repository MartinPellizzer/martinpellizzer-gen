    "intro": "Holcus nutans, commonly known as the nodding grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish or pale yellow, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Holcus nutans is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in waste areas, where it thrives in sunny to partially shaded conditions."
