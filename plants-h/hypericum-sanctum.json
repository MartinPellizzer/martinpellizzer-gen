    "intro": "Hypericum sanctum, commonly known as sacred St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its distinctive reddish-orange stems. The plant contains bioactive compounds such as hypericin and hyperforin, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. Hypericum sanctum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats. Its historical use in herbal medicine dates back centuries, particularly for its purported antidepressant effects."
