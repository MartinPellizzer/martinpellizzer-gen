    "intro": "Heuchera rubescens var. oregonensis, commonly known as the Oregon coral bells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It features striking, heart-shaped leaves that range from deep red to purple and bronze, depending on the season and light exposure. The plant produces upright spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and compact growth habit make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
