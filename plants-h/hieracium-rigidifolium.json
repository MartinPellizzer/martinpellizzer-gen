    "intro": "Hieracium rigidifolium, commonly known as rigid-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are stiff and lance-shaped, often with a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered an indicator species for certain habitats."
