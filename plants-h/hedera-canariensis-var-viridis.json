    "intro": "Hedera canariensis var. viridis, commonly known as the Canary ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used as a decorative plant in gardens and indoor spaces. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a problematic species in certain regions."
