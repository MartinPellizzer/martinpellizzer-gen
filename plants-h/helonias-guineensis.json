    "intro": "Helonias guineensis, commonly known as the Guinea marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in tropical Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescence with pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are linear and often covered in a fine, silvery down, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to waterlogged conditions. Helonias guineensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its wetland environment."
