    "intro": "Herminium suave, commonly known as the sweet twayblade, is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is native to various parts of Europe and Asia. It is a small, perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a slender, grass-like appearance with a single, erect stem that bears a single flower, often in late spring or early summer. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, and the plant lacks true leaves, relying on its rhizomes for photosynthesis. Herminium suave is noted for its delicate beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
