    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. perthusiense, commonly known as the Perthusian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface and is characterized by its erect, flowering stems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
