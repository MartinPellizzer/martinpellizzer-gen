    "intro": "Humata pinnata, commonly known as the sandalwood tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood and compound leaves with a pinnate structure. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, fibrous seeds. It thrives in humid climates and is often found in lowland and hill forest areas. Due to its valuable timber and essential oils, it is also an economically important species in traditional medicine and perfumery."
