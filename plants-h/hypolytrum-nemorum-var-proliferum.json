    "intro": "Hypolytrum nemorum var. proliferum, commonly known as the bog orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland and peatland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in dense clusters, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and bogs. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
