    "intro": "Hypochaeris oligocephala, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer, followed by pale yellow to brown seeds. Hypochaeris oligocephala is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
