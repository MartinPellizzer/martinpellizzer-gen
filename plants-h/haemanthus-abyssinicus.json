    "intro": "Haemanthus abyssinicus, commonly known as the African snowflake, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features a rosette of dark green, glossy, sword-shaped leaves that are densely packed at the base. The plant produces umbels of white, star-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring, which resemble snowflakes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its unique appearance and seasonal blooming make it a valuable addition to both cultivated and natural landscapes."
