    "intro": "Hedyotis verticillata, commonly known as the spiral herb or small red root, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of tiny, red or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
