    "intro": "Hypericum leschenaultii var. coriaceum, commonly known as the rough St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems covered in stiff, coriaceous leaves that give it its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
