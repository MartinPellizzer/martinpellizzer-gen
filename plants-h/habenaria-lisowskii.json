    "intro": "Habenaria lisowskii, commonly known as the Lisowskii's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate floral structure, which includes three sepals and three petals, with the latter often being modified into a lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires specific humidity and temperature conditions for successful growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
