It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, typically blooming in late spring. Its pods contain several elliptical seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Hedysarum nalla-kaschina is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in soil stabilization in its native environment."
