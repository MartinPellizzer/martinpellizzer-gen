    "intro": "Habenaria patentiloba, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, lance-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often humid and shaded habitats. Its leaves are usually broad and grass-like, growing from the base of the pseudobulbs. This orchid is appreciated for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or tropical gardens."
