    "intro": "Heptapleurum pergamaceum, commonly known as the paper-leaf laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery, and often glossy leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are used in traditional medicine and are also valued for their ornamental qualities in horticulture."
