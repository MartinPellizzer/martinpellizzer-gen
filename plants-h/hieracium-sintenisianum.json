    "intro": "Hieracium sintenisianum, commonly known as the Sintenis' hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
