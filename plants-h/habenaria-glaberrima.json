    "intro": "Habenaria glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth-leafed orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in protected areas and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
