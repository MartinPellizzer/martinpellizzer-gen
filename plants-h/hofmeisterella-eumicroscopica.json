    "intro": "Hofmeisterella eumicroscopica, commonly known as the minute moss, is a rare and diminutive species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its extremely small size, with plants typically less than 1 cm in height. The leaves are narrow, densely arranged, and often have a distinct costa that extends nearly to the apex. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on soil or rock surfaces in temperate regions. Due to its small stature and limited distribution, it is considered a challenging subject for botanical study."
