    "intro": "Hieracium praelongipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium praelongipes is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
