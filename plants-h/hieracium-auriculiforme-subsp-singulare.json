    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. singulare, commonly known as the single-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are usually basal, with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base, and it has a weak, creeping stem. This subspecies is notable for its limited geographic distribution and its role in local ecosystems."
