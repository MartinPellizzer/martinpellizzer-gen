    "intro": "Hieracium smolandicum subsp. turbiniceps, commonly known as the Turbinicapped Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of northern Europe. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often reflexed. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive, turbinated (spiral-shaped) involucres that enclose the flower head."
