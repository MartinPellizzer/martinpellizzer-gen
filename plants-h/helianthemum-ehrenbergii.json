    "intro": "Helianthemum ehrenbergii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and silvery-gray, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
