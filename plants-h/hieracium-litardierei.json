    "intro": "Hieracium litardierei, commonly known as the Litardiere's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster. Hieracium litardierei is relatively rare and is often found in specific microhabitats, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
