    "intro": "Haplopappus multifolius, commonly known as the desert groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it plays a role in stabilizing soil in desert ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
