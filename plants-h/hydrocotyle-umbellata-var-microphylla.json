    "intro": "Hydrocotyle umbellata var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and ditches. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Araliaceae family. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
