It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are velvety to the touch, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Hegnera obcordata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in moist lowland forests. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
