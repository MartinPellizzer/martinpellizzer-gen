    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. columnae, commonly known as the columnar stonecrop, is a low-growing, evergreen succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that form a compact, upright rosette. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne on short, upright stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it an attractive addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
