    "intro": "Hieracium macromalloides, commonly known as the large-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss."
