    "intro": "Hallia sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are typically bright green and glossy, with a distinctive veining pattern. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Hallia sagittata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and filter water."
