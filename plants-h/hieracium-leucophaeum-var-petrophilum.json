    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum var. petrophilum, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in harsh, high-altitude environments. Its flowers are composite, consisting of ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is adapted to cold climates and has a slow growth rate, making it a rare and specialized species."
