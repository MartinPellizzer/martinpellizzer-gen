It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its spreading growth habit. Its flowering period occurs in late summer, producing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
