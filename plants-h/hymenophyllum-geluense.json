    "intro": "Hymenophyllum geluense, commonly known as the Arctic fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in cold, moist environments. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, often silver-haired fronds. The plant has a unique ability to retain moisture, which helps it survive in its harsh, alpine or Arctic habitats. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum geluense plays an important ecological role in nutrient cycling in its cold environments."
