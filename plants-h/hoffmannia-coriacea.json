    "intro": "Hoffmannia coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf hoffmannia, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Hoffmannia coriacea is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in gardens."
