    "intro": "Hingtsha, commonly known as the \"Chinese hawthorn,\" is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to East Asia. It belongs to the genus Crataegus in the rose family, Rosaceae, and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant produces small, red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional Chinese medicine. Hingtsha thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
