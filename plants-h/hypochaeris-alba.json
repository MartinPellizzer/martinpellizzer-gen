    "intro": "Hypochaeris alba, commonly known as white mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its white flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hypochaeris alba is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
