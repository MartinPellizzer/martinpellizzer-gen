    "intro": "Hordeum caput-medusae subsp. asperum, commonly known as the rough-headed barley, is a grass species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
