    "intro": "Hieracium brandelii, commonly known as the Brandel's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer. Hieracium brandelii is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
