    "intro": "Hakea coriacea, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, leathery foliage that is often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or spiny flower spikes, typically in shades of yellow or red, which appear in late summer to early autumn. Hakea coriacea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal and semi-arid environments. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
