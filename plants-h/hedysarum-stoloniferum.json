    "intro": "Hedysarum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping bartsia, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its stoloniferous growth habit allows it to spread horizontally, forming dense mats that help stabilize soil. Hedysarum stoloniferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in preventing soil erosion."
