    "intro": "Hieracium scabriusculum f. phaeostylum, commonly known as the pale leaf hawkweed, is a botanical variant of the common hawkweed species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grasslands. The plant features upright stems with rough, hairy surfaces and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a pale green color. Its flowers are yellow, forming a composite head with many small florets, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced leaf pigmentation, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to other hawkweed varieties."
