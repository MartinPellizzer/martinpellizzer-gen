    "intro": "Hieracium pseudovalesiacum, commonly known as the false violet hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its flowers are yellow with a central disc, and it produces achene fruits that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium pseudovalesiacum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it an important component of local flora."
