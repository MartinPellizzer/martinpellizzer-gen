    "intro": "Hicriopteris remota, commonly known as the remote water fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, and it reproduces through sexual reproduction via spore dispersal. Hicriopteris remota is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
