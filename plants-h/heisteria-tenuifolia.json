    "intro": "Heisteria tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heister, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial with lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its botanical features make it a suitable choice for woodland gardens and as a ground cover in shaded areas."
