It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
