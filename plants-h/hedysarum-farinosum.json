    "intro": "Hedysarum farinosum, commonly known as the farina peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum farinosum is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. Its seeds are encased in a hairy, inflated pod, which aids in wind dispersal."
