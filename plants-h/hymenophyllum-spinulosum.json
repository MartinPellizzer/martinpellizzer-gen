    "intro": "Hymenophyllum spinulosum, commonly known as the spinulose maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum spinulosum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in its preferred microhabitats."
