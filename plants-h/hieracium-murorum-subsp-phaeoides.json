    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. phaeoides, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and the plant often grows in grassy areas and open woodlands. It is a low-growing species, usually reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in the summer months. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and is sometimes considered a variant of the more common Hieracium murorum."
