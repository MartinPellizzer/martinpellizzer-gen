    "intro": "Hydrocotyle andina, commonly known as the Andean water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to South America. It features floating leaves that are typically divided into lobes, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters and are often pollinated by insects. Hydrocotyle andina is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
