    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 muscelii, commonly known as the hybrid meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and stems that bear clusters of yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation, making it difficult to distinguish from its parent species."
