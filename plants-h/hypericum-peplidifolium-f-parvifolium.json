    "intro": "Hypericum peplidifolium f. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are smaller than those of the typical species, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its small stature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
