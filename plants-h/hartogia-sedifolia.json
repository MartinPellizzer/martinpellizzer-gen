    "intro": "Hartogia sedifolia, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It has a dense, mat-like growth habit with small, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters during the cooler months. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Hartogia sedifolia is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
