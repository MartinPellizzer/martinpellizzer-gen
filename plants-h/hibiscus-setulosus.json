    "intro": "Hibiscus setulosus, commonly known as the hairy hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. Hibiscus setulosus thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
