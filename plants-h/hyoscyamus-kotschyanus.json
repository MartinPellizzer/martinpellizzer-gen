It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces distinctive, spurred flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically ovate or lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it contains various alkaloids, some of which have medicinal or toxic properties. Due to its ornamental value and historical use, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its potential toxicity."
