    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ivohibense, commonly known as the Madagascar spore moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This species is epiphytic, growing on tree trunks and branches in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum ivohibense is native to Madagascar and is adapted to thrive in tropical rainforest conditions."
