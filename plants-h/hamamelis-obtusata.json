It is characterized by its fragrant, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has simple, elliptic leaves that are dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that release seeds in the spring.
