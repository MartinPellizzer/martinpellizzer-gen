    "intro": "Heterocypsela andersonii, commonly known as the Anderson's heterocypsela, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant produces small, hard-coated seeds known as cypselas, which are adapted for wind dispersal. It is native to specific regions in North America, particularly in the southwestern United States. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
