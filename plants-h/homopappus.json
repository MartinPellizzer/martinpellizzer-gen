    "intro": "Homopappus, commonly known as the \"blazing star\" or \"glandular goldenrod,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a rough or hairy texture. Homopappus species are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. They are often found in disturbed soils and are adapted to thrive in dry, hot environments."
