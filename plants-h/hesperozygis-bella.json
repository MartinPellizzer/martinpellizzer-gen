    "intro": "Hesperozygis bella, commonly known as the fairy lantern, is a striking member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. The plant is characterized by its vivid orange to red tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Hesperozygis bella is also known for its unique seed capsules that resemble small lanterns, giving it its common name."
