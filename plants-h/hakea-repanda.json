    "intro": "Hakea repanda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea repanda is adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in dry environments. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
