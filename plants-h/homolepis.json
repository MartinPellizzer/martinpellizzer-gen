    "intro": "Homolepis, commonly known as the clustered bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Campanulaceae. It consists of several species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly in Asia and North America. The plants are characterized by their clustered inflorescences, which give them their common name. They typically have opposite or whorled leaves and produce showy, bell-shaped flowers in various colors. Homolepis species are often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks."
