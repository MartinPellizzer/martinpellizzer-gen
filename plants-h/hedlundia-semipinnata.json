    "intro": "Hedlundia semipinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hedlundia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive pinnate structure, with the central leaf axis being shorter than the lateral ones. Hedlundia semipinnata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
