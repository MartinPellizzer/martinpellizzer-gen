It is characterized by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to the typical form. The plant features yellow flowers with prominent stamens, and its leaves are often dotted with translucent glands. It is native to Europe and thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. This form is less commonly cultivated but shares many medicinal properties with its parent species."
