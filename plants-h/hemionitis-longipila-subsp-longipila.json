    "intro": "Hemionitis longipila subsp. longipila, commonly known as the long-leaf hemionitis, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its finely divided, linear leaves that form dense, floating mats on the water surface. The plant has small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish in color, adapted for pollination by wind or insects. It thrives in nutrient-poor, freshwater environments and is sensitive to water quality changes. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered endangered in many regions."
