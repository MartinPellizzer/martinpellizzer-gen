    "intro": "Hesperis montana, commonly known as the sweet rocket, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which is characterized by its four-petaled flowers and seed pods that split open at maturity. The plant produces vibrant clusters of pink or purple flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Hesperis montana thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and naturalized areas."
