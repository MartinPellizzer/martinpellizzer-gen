    "intro": "Heterocaryum macrocarpum, commonly known as the giant cup plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 3 meters tall, making it a notable presence in wetland habitats. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a waxy coating. The fruit is a follicle that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist environments."
