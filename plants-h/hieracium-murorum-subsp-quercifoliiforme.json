    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. quercifoliiforme, commonly known as the oak-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that resemble the shape of oak leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance and growth habit."
