    "intro": "Huperzia phylicifolia, commonly known as the licorice fern, is a species of clubmoss native to the temperate regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that form a dense carpet of foliage. Its leaves are linear and often have a slightly serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Huperzia phylicifolia is valued in horticulture for its ability to stabilize soil and its aesthetic qualities in woodland gardens."
