    "intro": "Helia daturoides, commonly known as the Philippine rosewood, is a deciduous tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries. It is valued for its hard, dense wood, which is used in traditional crafts and furniture. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
