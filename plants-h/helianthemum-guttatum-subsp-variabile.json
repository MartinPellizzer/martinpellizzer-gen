    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. variabile, commonly known as the variable cushion sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Its subspecific variation contributes to its adaptability and ecological significance in its native habitats."
