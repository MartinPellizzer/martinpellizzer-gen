    "intro": "Heliophila tricuspidata, commonly known as the three-lobed waterplantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in environments with ample sunlight. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with three distinct lobes, which help in maximizing light absorption. Its flowers are small and clustered, often with white or pale pink petals, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Heliophila tricuspidata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
