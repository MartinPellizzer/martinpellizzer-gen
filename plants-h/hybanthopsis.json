    "intro": "Hybanthopsis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Australia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with small, pale green flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Hybanthopsis has a short, creeping stem and produces a single flower that is often mistaken for a leaf due to its lack of a visible stem. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is protected in many regions."
