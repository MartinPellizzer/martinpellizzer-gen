It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are densely arranged, giving it its common name. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret structure, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, often forming dense mats."
