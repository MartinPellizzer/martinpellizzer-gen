    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. salisaquensis, commonly known as the Salina Hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, branched flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to orange ray florets. The plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. It has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats. Its botanical features make it distinct within the genus Hieracium, with specific adaptations to its wetland environments."
