    "intro": "Hesperonia glutinosa subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender sticky hesperon, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its slender stems and sticky secretions on its leaves and stems, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, achene-like fruits for seed dispersal."
