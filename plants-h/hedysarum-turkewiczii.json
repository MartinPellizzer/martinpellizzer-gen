    "intro": "Hedysarum turkewiczii, commonly known as Turkewicz's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. It has a fibrous root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Hedysarum turkewiczii plays a role in soil stabilization and is of interest for its potential in ecological restoration projects."
