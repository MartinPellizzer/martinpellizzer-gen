It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium tragopogon is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some regions."
