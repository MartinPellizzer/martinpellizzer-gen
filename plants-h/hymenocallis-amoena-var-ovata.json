    "intro": "Hymenocallis amoena var. ovata, commonly known as the oval white spider lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, white, funnel-shaped flowers with a prominent yellow throat, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant features strap-like, dark green leaves that are broad and slightly wavy at the edges. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens in warm climates. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to produce offsets, allowing for easy propagation."
