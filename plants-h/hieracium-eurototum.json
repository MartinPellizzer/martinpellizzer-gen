    "intro": "Hieracium eurototum, commonly known as the European hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
