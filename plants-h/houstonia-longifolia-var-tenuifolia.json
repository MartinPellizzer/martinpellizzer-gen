    "intro": "Houstonia longifolia var. tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf bluemink, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the stems are usually prostrate or spreading. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more slender leaves compared to the typical form of Houstonia longifolia."
