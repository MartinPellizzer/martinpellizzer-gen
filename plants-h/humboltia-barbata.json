    "intro": "Humboltia barbata, commonly known as the hooked leaf shrub, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive hooked tip. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, rounded seeds. Humboltia barbata is adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline."
