    "intro": "Haworthia triebneriana var. sublineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white or pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
