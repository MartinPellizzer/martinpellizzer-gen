    "intro": "Helichrysum macranthum, commonly known as the golden crown, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, silver-green foliage. The plant produces small, spherical seed heads that are often mistaken for the flowers themselves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum macranthum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
