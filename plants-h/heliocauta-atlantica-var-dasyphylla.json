    "intro": "Heliocauta atlantica var. dasyphylla, commonly known as the Atlantic sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Atlantic Ocean. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow ray flowers that resemble those of the common sunflower. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
