The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are often hairy and can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. Due to its restricted distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
