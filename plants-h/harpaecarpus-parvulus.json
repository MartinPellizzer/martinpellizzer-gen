    "intro": "Harpaecarpus parvulus, commonly known as the small-fruited harpaecarpus, is a rare and little-studied plant species belonging to the family Arecaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered inflorescences. The plant's leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Its fruits are small, hard, and contain a single seed, which is a distinguishing feature. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
