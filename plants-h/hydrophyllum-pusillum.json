    "intro": "Hydrophyllum pusillum, commonly known as the smallleaf hydrophyllum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its growth habit is often prostrate or ascending, with stems that may root at the nodes. Hydrophyllum pusillum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
