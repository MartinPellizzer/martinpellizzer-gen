    "intro": "Habenella ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes stinging nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called cypselae. Although it lacks the stinging hairs of true nettles, it is often mistaken for them due to its similar appearance."
