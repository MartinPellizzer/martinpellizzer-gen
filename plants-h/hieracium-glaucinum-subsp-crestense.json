    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. crestense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The plant thrives in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it tolerates cold and high-altitude conditions. It has a taproot system that allows it to anchor firmly in rocky or poor soils. This subspecies is often found in open habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
