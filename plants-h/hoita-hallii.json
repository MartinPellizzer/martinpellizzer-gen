    "intro": "Hoita hallii, commonly known as the Hall's hoita, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and has elliptical leaves with a smooth texture. Hoita hallii is noted for its unique inflorescence, which consists of clusters of tiny flowers arranged in a cyme. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
