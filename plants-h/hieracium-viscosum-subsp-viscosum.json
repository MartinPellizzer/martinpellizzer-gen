    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. viscosum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are often sticky to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
