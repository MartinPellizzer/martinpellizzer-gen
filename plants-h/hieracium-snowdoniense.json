    "intro": "Hieracium snowdoniense, commonly known as Snowdon's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Wales. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
