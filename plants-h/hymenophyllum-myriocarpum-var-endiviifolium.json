    "intro": "Hymenophyllum myriocarpum var. endiviifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in shaded forest floors. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is distinguished by its narrow, endiviifolium-like leaf shape, which sets it apart from other varieties within the species."
