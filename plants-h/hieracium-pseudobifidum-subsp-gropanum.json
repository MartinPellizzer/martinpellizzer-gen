It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. The plant has basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies status reflects distinct morphological and genetic characteristics from the main species. It is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and adjacent regions."
