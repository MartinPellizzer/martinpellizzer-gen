    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. semirupicola, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies is characterized by its pale yellow flowers and shorter, more compact growth form compared to other hawkweed species. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of its ecosystem."
