    "intro": "Hieracium macrophyllum var. eglandulosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features a rosette of broad, hairy, and often bluish-gray leaves that help it retain moisture. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its hairy foliage and showy flowers make it a distinctive and ornamental plant in its native habitat."
