    "intro": "Hakea archaeoides, commonly known as the ancient hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny foliage and its unique, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has adapted to arid environments with its thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hakea archaeoides is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in dry conditions."
