    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. veprinacense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disc florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is a low-growing species, often found in meadows and open slopes at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
