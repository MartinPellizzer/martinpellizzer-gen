    "intro": "Hakea biformis, commonly known as the two-branched hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical or spindly stems that often branch at the base, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea biformis is adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions with a Mediterranean climate."
