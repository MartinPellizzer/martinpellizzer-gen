    "intro": "Hornea guineensis, commonly known as the African butter tree, is a small evergreen tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical, glossy green leaves. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing oily seeds. The seeds are valued for their high oil content, which is used in traditional medicine and as a source of biodiesel. Hornea guineensis thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and along riverbanks."
