    "intro": "Hieracium flagelliferum subsp. deltophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
