    "intro": "Houstonia prostrata var. parvula, commonly known as the dwarf blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, delicate blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature compared to other Houstonia species, making it well-suited for shaded environments."
