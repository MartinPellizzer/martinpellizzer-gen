    "intro": "Henckelia reptans var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, velvety texture, while its flowers are fragrant and attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
