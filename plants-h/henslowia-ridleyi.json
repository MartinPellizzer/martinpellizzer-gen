    "intro": "Henslowia ridleyi, commonly known as the Malayan henslowia, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant is notable for its delicate, fragrant blooms that are typically white or pale pink in color. Henslowia ridleyi is often found in shaded, humid environments and is adapted to thrive in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
