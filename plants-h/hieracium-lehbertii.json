    "intro": "Hieracium lehbertii, commonly known as Lehbert's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with both ray and disk florets."
