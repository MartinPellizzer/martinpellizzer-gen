    "intro": "Horsfieldia ampliformis, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. Horsfieldia ampliformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or conservatories."
