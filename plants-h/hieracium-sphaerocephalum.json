    "intro": "Hieracium sphaerocephalum, commonly known as the globe hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compact, spherical flower heads that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
