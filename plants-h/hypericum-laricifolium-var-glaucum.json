    "intro": "Hypericum laricifolium var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous St. John's wort, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, upright inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
