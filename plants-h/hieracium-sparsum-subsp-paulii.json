    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. paulii, commonly known as the Paul's hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are covered in fine, soft pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in a single, terminal capitulum, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are alternate, often lobed, and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sunny habitats, often found in alpine meadows and open woodlands."
