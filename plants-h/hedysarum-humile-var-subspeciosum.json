It features slender, wiry stems and small, trifoliate leaves with a delicate, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale yellow to reddish-brown, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
