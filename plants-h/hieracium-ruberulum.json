    "intro": "Hieracium ruberulum, commonly known as the red-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are yellow with a reddish tinge, giving it its common name. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
