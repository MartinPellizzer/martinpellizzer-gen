    "intro": "Halopegia macrostachya, commonly known as the large-stemmed halopegia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy inflorescences. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces clusters of tubular, two-lipped flowers in shades of pink to purple. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
