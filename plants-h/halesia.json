    "intro": "Halesia, commonly known as the silverbell, is a genus of flowering plants in the beech family, Fagaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to eastern North America. The plants are deciduous shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their showy, bell-shaped white or pale yellow flowers that appear in spring. The leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly toothed margin. Halesia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their delicate blossoms and attractive foliage."
