    "intro": "Heliotropium tuberculosum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a distinctive dark center. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically grows in coastal areas or sandy soils, and its stems are often prostrate or trailing. Heliotropium tuberculosum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
