    "intro": "Hieracium andrasovszkyi subsp. glabratoidiforme, commonly known as the smoothleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It typically thrives in dry meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
