    "intro": "Hieracium obesiceps, commonly known as the fathead hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broad and lobed, with a rough texture, and its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Hieracium obesiceps is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
