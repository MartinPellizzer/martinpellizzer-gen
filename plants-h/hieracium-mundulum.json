    "intro": "Hieracium mundulum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flower heads, which consist of ray florets and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with upright flowering stems and basal leaves that are often heart-shaped. Hieracium mundulum is an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
