    "intro": "Hyalosema, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that give it a ghostly appearance. Hyalosema species typically grow in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants have rhizomatous growth, with small, clustered fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
