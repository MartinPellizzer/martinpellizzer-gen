    "intro": "Halosarcia lepidosperma, commonly known as the coastal bladderpod, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has alternate, pinnately compound leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Halosarcia lepidosperma is well adapted to saline and arid environments, making it a resilient species in coastal ecosystems."
