It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in the summer months. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
