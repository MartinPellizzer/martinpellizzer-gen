    "intro": "Hutchinsia tournefortii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Hutchinsia tournefortii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in low-water landscapes."
