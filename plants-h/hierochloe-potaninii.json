    "intro": "Hierochloe potaninii, commonly known as the Tibetan bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, blue-green blades and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky slopes. The plant thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to low-nutrient soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are loosely arranged, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hierochloe potaninii plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
