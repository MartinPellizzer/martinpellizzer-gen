    "intro": "Huernia zebrina subsp. insigniflora, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a compact, rounded stem covered in short, spiky ribs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to tubercles, and it thrives in well-draining soil with minimal water. It is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance."
