    "intro": "Heliotropium montevidense, commonly known as the Montevideo heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
