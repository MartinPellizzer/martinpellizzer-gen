    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. prasiophaeum, commonly known as the green-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It features basal rosettes of narrowly lanceolate, glaucous leaves that are often tinged with a bluish hue. The plant produces yellow disc flowers surrounded by yellow to orange ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, calcareous grasslands and open woodlands, preferring full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
