    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. retusa, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a dense rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall stalks during the warmer months. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and indoor gardeners."
