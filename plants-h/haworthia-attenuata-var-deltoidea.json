    "intro": "Haworthia attenuata var. deltoidea, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with white or pale green markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, emerging from the rosette of leaves. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
