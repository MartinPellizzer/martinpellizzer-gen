It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disk. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical significance lies in its historical association with the Jurassic period and its role in ecological studies."
