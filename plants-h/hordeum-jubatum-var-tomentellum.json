It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy, grayish-green leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
