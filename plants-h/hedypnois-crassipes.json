    "intro": "Hedypnois crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved water lily, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water's surface. Its roots anchor in the sediment, while its leaves provide habitat for aquatic life. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a mild scent to attract pollinators."
