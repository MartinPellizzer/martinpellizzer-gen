    "intro": "Habenaria hoehnei, commonly known as the Hoehne's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and green, often with a yellowish tinge. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
