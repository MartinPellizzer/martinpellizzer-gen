    "intro": "Hemionitis parviloba, commonly known as the small-leafed hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in a distinctive pattern. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hemionitis parviloba is considered a conservation concern in many areas."
