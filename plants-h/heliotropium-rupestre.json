    "intro": "Heliotropium rupestre, commonly known as rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling the appearance of true heliotropes. The plant typically grows in dry, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and arranged in opposite pairs, which helps reduce water loss. Heliotropium rupestre is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid landscapes."
