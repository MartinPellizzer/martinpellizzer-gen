    "intro": "Heterothrix, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Montiaceae. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny, white or pale blue flowers. These plants are typically found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. Heterothrix species are often low-growing, with a rosette-like structure that helps conserve moisture. Their botanical features make them well-adapted to harsh, dry climates."
