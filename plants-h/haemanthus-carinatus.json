    "intro": "Haemanthus carinatus, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking perennial plant native to South Africa. It features tall, erect stems covered in narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in summer, creating a dramatic visual display. Its inflorescence is a dense spike of showy bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Haemanthus carinatus is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
