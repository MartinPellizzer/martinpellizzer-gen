It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble gold. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum bujerianum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
