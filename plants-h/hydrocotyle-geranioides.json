    "intro": "Hydrocotyle geranioides, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, adapting to aquatic conditions. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil in wetland areas. Hydrocotyle geranioides is also known for its aromatic foliage, which contains compounds with potential medicinal properties."
