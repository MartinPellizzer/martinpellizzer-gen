    "intro": "Haplopappus carthamoides subsp. subsquarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters tall, with linear, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its squarrose (ascending) phyllaries and the presence of a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
