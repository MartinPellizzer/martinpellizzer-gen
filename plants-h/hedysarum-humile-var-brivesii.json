    "intro": "Hedysarum humile var. brivesii, commonly known as the dwarf vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, trifoliate leaves and produces delicate, pink to purple pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it ecologically significant in its native environment. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
