    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. lithophilum, commonly known as the Lithophilous Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. This subspecies is adapted to grow in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its growth habit and floral structure are typical of the genus Hieracium, which includes many species of hawkweeds. The plant is generally found in Europe, particularly in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained, sunny environments."
