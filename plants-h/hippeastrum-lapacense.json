    "intro": "Hippeastrum lapacense, commonly known as the Peruvian lily, is a species of amaryllid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, typically in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the flowers, with broad, strap-like leaves emerging from the base. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy to bloom successfully. Hippeastrum lapacense is popular as a cultivated ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
