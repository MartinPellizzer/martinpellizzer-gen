    "intro": "Hosta albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged hosta, is a species native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with distinctive white margins. The plant typically grows to a height of about 12 to 18 inches and thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage is the primary ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. Hosta albomarginata is well-suited for woodland gardens and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
