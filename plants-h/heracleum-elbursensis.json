    "intro": "Heracleum elbursensis, commonly known as the Elburz hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall stature and compound leaves. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Elburz range in Iran, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces large, umbrella-like inflorescences that bear small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to the skin when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a problematic species in certain ecological contexts."
