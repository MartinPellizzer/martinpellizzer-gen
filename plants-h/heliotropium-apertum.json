    "intro": "Heliotropium apertum, commonly known as the sunflower weed, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. Its leaves are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it often grows in disturbed soils. Heliotropium apertum is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
