    "intro": "Hordeum incrinum, commonly known as the downy barley, is a species of grass native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its hairy leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as sagebrush steppe. Hordeum incrinum produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers. It is a perennial plant that plays a role in stabilizing soil in arid environments."
