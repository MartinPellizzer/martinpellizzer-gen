    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. erythropoecilum, commonly known as the red-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
