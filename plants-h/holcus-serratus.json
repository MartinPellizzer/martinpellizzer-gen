    "intro": "Holcus serratus, commonly known as the serrated bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with serrated edges, which give it its common name. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Holcus serratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping for its fine texture and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
