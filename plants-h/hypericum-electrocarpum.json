    "intro": "Hypericum electrocarpum, commonly known as the electric-stem St. John's wort, is a member of the Hypericaceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and woody stems, which are often covered in small, glandular dots. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as wet meadows and stream banks. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. The species is notable for its potential medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
