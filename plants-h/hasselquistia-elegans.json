    "intro": "Hasselquistia elegans, commonly known as the elegant sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine and tundra environments. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces delicate white or pink flowers during the short growing season. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and ability to survive in harsh, cold climates. Hasselquistia elegans plays a role in stabilizing soil in its extreme habitat and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptations to cold environments."
