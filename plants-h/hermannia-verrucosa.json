    "intro": "Hermannia verrucosa, commonly known as the woolly hermannia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in coastal or mountainous regions. The plant features dense, woolly foliage that gives it its common name, and it produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. Hermannia verrucosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens. It is also known for its ability to thrive in dry conditions, making it relatively drought-tolerant."
