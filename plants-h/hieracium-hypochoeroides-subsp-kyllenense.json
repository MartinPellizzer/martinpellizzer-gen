    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. kyllenense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude areas."
