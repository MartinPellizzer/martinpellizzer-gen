    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. lucidus, commonly known as the shining globe-mallow, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compact, globular growth habit and produces small, yellow flowers in late spring. The plant has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, silky hairs. Its fruit is a dry, hairy pappus that aids in wind dispersal, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This species is adapted to harsh, dry environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly habitats."
