    "intro": "Habrothamnus porphyreus, commonly known as the purple sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its small, showy purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture that helps reduce water loss. The species is adapted to drought conditions and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
