    "intro": "Hyoseris lucida, commonly known as the bright-eyed dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are oblanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is hairy and often branched. Its yellow flower heads consist of numerous small florets, and it produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Hyoseris lucida is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils."
