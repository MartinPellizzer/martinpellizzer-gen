It is characterized by its unique spiral twisting stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Hedysarum gyrans is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
