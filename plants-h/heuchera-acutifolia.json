It is characterized by its finely cut, dark green foliage that often turns red or bronze in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Heuchera acutifolia is a popular choice for woodland gardens due to its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit."
