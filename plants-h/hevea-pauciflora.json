    "intro": "Hevea pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers clustered in fascicles, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is less commercially significant than other Hevea species. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
