    "intro": "Hierochloe borealis, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, wiry stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, greenish flowers. Hierochloe borealis plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic wildlife."
