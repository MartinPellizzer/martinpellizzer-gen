It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many milkweed-like plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a distinctive pungent aroma, similar to that of pepper. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous tiny seeds.
