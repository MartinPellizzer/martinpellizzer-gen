It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dense, woolly hairs on its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers typically bloom in summer, and it thrives in meadows and disturbed soils. Hieracium eriomallum is often considered a weed but has ornamental value due to its unique foliage."
