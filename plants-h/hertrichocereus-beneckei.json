It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spineless, ribbed stems that store water efficiently. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. These flowers emit a strong fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique blooming habit."
