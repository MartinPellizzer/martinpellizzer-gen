    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia subsp. muelleri, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and striking, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky crevices. It produces a single spike of flowers that bloom in early summer, and its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine. The subspecies muelleri is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to the typical form of H. latifolia."
