It typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, elongated leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, which produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
