    "intro": "Hexinia, commonly known as the common tansy, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun. The plant contains pyrethrin, a natural insecticide, which has historically been used in pest control. However, it is toxic to livestock and should be handled with care."
