It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, thick leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the summer months. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage. Hylotelelephium mingjinianum prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
