    "intro": "Hydrosme aspera, commonly known as the rough hydrosme, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes caraway and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are rough to the touch, hence the species name \"aspera,\" and it produces small, clustered white or greenish flowers. Hydrosme aspera is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
