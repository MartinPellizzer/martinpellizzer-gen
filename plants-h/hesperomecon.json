It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their milky sap. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers.

Its ecological importance includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
