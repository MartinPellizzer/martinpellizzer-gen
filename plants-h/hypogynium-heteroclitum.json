    "intro": "Hypogynium heteroclitum, commonly known as the lesser goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are yellow, with tubular corollas that attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The hypogynium, a structure at the base of the flower, is distinctive and plays a role in the plant's reproductive biology."
