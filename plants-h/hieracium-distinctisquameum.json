It is native to Europe and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, often scaly leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its spread. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
