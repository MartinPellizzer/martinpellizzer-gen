    "intro": "Habenaria vaupellii, commonly known as the Vaupell's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
