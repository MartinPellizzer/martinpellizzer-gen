It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, grass-like leaves and produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its growth habit and appearance resemble that of a moss, hence its common name. Humboltia muscoidea is known for its unique morphology and is of interest to botanists and orchid enthusiasts alike."
