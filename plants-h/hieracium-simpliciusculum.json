    "intro": "Hieracium simpliciusculum, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and often endangered species in many regions."
