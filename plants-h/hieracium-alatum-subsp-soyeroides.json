    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. soyeroides, commonly known as the winged hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, hairy, winged stems that give it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant typically grows in grassy or disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats where it can thrive in full sun."
