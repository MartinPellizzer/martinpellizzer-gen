    "intro": "Hyoscyamus agrestis var. sinuatus, commonly known as the sinuous thornapple, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers that give way to spherical, spiny fruits containing toxic seeds. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its toxic properties, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas and requires caution when handling."
