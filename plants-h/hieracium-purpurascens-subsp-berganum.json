    "intro": "Hieracium purpurascens subsp. berganum, commonly known as the Bergman's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
