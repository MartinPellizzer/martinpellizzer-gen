It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale blue markings that resemble spider webs. The plant produces tall, branched stems with small, white flowers during the summer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for collectors and ornamental gardening."
