    "intro": "Henriettea brunnescens, commonly known as the brown-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to brown flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Henriettea brunnescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
