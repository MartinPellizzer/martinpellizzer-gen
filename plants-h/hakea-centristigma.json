    "intro": "Hakea centristigma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Hakea centristigma is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important species in its native habitat."
