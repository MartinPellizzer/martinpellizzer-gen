    "intro": "Helianthemum ciliatum f. dasycladum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with finely hairy leaves that provide a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found on rocky or gravelly soils. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
