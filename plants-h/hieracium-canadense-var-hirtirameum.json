    "intro": "Hieracium canadense var. hirtirameum, commonly known as the hairy yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent central disc florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
