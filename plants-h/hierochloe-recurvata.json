    "intro": "Hierochloe recurvata, commonly known as bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and often forms dense, mat-like growth patterns. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its slender culms and compact inflorescences contribute to its ornamental appeal in horticultural settings. Hierochloe recurvata is also valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
