    "intro": "Helichrysum leontopodium, commonly known as the edelweiss, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its dense, white or pale yellow flower heads surrounded by soft, fuzzy bracts that resemble a crown. The plant thrives in cool, sunny environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early autumn, and the plant is known for its hardiness and slow growth. Due to its association with alpine environments and its striking appearance, it is a symbol of resilience and purity."
