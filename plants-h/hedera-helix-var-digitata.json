    "intro": "Hedera helix var. digitata, commonly known as the English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features glossy, dark green, lobed leaves that are typically five- to seven-lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its dense coverage and ability to climb structures. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
