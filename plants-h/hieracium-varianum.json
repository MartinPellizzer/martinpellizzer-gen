    "intro": "Hieracium varianum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually basal and have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
