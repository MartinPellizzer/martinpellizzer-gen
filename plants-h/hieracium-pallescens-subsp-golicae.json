    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium pallescens subsp. golicae, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to parts of Europe and western Asia, this subspecies thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
