    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum subsp. affine, commonly known as the slender marsh orchid, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes, fens, and damp meadows. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. The subspecies affine is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more slender stems compared to the typical form of H. hircinum."
