    "intro": "Hutchinsia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, often hairy stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically alternate, simple, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Hutchinsia species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and thick cuticles to conserve moisture. They are popular in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and vibrant floral displays."
