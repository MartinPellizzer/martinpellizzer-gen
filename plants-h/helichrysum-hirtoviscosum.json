    "intro": "Helichrysum hirtoviscosum, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. Its leaves are glandular and produce a sticky substance, which helps protect it from herbivores. The flowers are typically short-lived but attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
