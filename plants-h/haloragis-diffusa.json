    "intro": "Haloragis diffusa, commonly known as the common water-starwort, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its submersed or floating aquatic growth habit, with small, star-shaped leaves. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Haloragis diffusa is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
