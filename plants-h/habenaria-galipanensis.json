    "intro": "Habenaria galipanensis, commonly known as the Galipan orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the humid air, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The orchid is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
