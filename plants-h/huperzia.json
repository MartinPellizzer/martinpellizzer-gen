    "intro": "Huperzia, commonly known as the rock harches or clubmoss, is a genus of evergreen ferns belonging to the family Huperziaceae. These plants are characterized by their simple, linear leaves and are typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia species are non-vascular plants that reproduce via spores rather than seeds, and they play an important role in maintaining soil stability in their habitats. Many species of Huperzia are used in traditional medicine and have been studied for their potential cognitive benefits."
