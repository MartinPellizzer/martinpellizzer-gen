    "intro": "Herniaria unomunoana, commonly known as the rock crassworts, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has a succulent appearance, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Herniaria unomunoana is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
