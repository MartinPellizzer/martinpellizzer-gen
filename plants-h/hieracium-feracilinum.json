    "intro": "Hieracium feracilinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium feracilinum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
