    "intro": "Haplopappus lanceolatus subsp. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed arrowhead, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to drought conditions. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces a single, slender flowering stem. Its botanical features make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is often found in desert scrub habitats."
