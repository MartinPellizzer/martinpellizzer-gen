    "intro": "Hypericum asahinae f. lucidum, commonly known as the glossy St. John's wort, is a rare and unique variant of the Hypericum genus. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in woodland and rocky habitats. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a desirable ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its aesthetic and ecological value."
