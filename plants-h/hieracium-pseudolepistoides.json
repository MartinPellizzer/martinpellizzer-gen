    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolepistoides, commonly known as the false sand everlasting, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and produces small, yellowish-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has linear, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the hawkweed genus, with ecological roles in soil stabilization and pollinator support."
