    "intro": "Hakea fasciculata, commonly known as the clustered hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of needle-like leaves, which are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in winter, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Hakea fasciculata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
