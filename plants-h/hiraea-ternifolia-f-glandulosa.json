    "intro": "Hiraea ternifolia f. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hiraea, is a variant of the hiraea plant characterized by its glandular structures on the leaves and stems. This plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. The leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are often hairy and bear small glands. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers, which are followed by capsule-like fruits containing minute seeds."
