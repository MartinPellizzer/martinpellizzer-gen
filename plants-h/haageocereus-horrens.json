    "intro": "Haageocereus horrens, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and clusters of white, night-blooming flowers. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh desert conditions with minimal water requirements. Its flowers open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant's structure and flowering habits make it a unique and striking example of desert flora."
