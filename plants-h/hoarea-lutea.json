    "intro": "Hoarea lutea, commonly known as the yellow bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hoarea lutea thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and drought tolerance."
