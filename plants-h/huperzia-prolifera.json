    "intro": "Huperzia prolifera, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, clustered growth habit. Native to regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spores rather than seeds, and its fronds are typically short and broad. Huperzia prolifera is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or forested habitats."
