    "intro": "Hevea apiculata, commonly known as the apiculate rubber tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its evergreen nature and lance-shaped leaves with a pointed tip. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its latex, similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis, has potential industrial uses. However, it is less commercially significant than its more well-known relative."
