    "intro": "Herpestis monnieria, commonly known as the narrow-leaved false nettle, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Urticaceae, which includes true nettles, and is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its stems are often covered in fine stinging hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Herpestis monnieria is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance and stinging properties."
