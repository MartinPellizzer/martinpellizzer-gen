It is characterized by its hairy, silver-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in alpine meadows and rocky soils, preferring cool, moist environments. Its subspecies name, *crinitisquamum*, refers to the silky, scaly appearance of its foliage. This plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in its habitat."
