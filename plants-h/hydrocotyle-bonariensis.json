    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bonariensis, commonly known as the Brazilian pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to South America. It features heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps it stay buoyant. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Hydrocotyle bonariensis is often used in aquariums and ponds for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
