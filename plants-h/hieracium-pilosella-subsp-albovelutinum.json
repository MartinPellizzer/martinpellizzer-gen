    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. albovelutinum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
