    "intro": "Hieracium macdonaldii var. macdonaldii, commonly known as MacDonald's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow ray florets that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
