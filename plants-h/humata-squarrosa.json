    "intro": "Humata squarrosa, commonly known as the squarrosa humata, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, often hairy foliage and its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. The plant typically grows as a small shrub, with leaves that are broad and sometimes lobed. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Humata squarrosa is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
