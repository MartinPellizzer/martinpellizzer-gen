    "intro": "Haplopappus multifolius subsp. multifolius, commonly known as the Desert Flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and feathery pappus. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by seed heads that are easily dispersed by the wind. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs to reduce water loss."
