    "intro": "Hamamelis dioica, commonly known as the yellow witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter, making it one of the last flowering plants of the season. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. Hamamelis dioica is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
