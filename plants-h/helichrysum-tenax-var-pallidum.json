    "intro": "Helichrysum tenax var. pallidum, commonly known as the pale everlasting or pale gum plant, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, seed-bearing structures that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its aromatic leaves and drought tolerance contribute to its ecological and horticultural value."
