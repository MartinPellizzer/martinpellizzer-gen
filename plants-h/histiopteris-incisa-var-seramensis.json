    "intro": "Histiopteris incisa var. seramensis, commonly known as the Seram fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to the Indonesian island of Seram. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The fronds are bioluminescent at night, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
