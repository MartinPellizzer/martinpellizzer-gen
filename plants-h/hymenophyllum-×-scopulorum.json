It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum \u00d7 scopulorum is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
