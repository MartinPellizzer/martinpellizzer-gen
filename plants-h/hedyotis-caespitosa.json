    "intro": "Hedyotis caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping jenny, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland gardens or along stream banks. Hedyotis caespitosa is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can suppress weeds and stabilize soil."
