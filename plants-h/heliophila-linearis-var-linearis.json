    "intro": "Heliophila linearis var. linearis, commonly known as narrowleaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features slender, linear leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. Its presence is an indicator of clean, nutrient-rich water in its habitat."
