It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wetlands. It has a shallow root system and spreads through rhizomes, making it adaptable to various soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
