    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, greyish-blue foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
