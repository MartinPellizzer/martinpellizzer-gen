    "intro": "Hymenaea stilbocarpa, commonly known as the yellow rosewood, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and distinctive yellow wood, which is highly valued for its density and beauty. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody pods containing flat, round seeds. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland tropical forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
