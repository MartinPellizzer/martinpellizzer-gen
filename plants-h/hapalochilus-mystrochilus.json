    "intro": "Hapalochilus mystrochilus, commonly known as the velvet leaf orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Indonesia. This plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and utilizing them for support rather than nutrients. Its leaves are thick and velvety, which helps in water retention in its humid environment. The flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pale pink."
