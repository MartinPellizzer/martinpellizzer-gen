It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
