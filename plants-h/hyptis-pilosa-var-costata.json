It is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its aromatic leaves are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The varietal name \"costata\" refers to the prominent veins that run along the leaf surfaces."
