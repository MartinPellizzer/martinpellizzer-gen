    "intro": "Haemanthus rotundifolius, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright red, torch-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-shaped, evergreen leaves that are rounded at the base, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
