    "intro": "Habenaria aguirrei, commonly known as the Aguirre's orchid, is a rare terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive lip. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
