    "intro": "Heliotropium ballii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Heliotropium ballii is often found in sandy soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
