    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dentatum, commonly known as the toothed fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, toothed fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help retain moisture in humid conditions. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in epiphytic and lithophytic ecosystems."
