    "intro": "Hieracium zahnii, commonly known as the Zahn's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, upright stem that bears yellowish-green flowers. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
