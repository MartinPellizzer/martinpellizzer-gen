    "intro": "Heliconia farinosa f. constricta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliconia, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves and vibrant orange-red bracts. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that are enclosed within the colorful bracts, which serve to attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its robust growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for tropical gardens and as a houseplant. The species is also valued for its role in traditional medicine and as a source of ornamental foliage in horticulture."
