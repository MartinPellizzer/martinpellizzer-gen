    "intro": "Hibiscus callosus, commonly known as the wooly hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy, velvety stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a contrasting yellow throat. Hibiscus callosus thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
