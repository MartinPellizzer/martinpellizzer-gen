    "intro": "Heterolamium flaviflorum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered heterolamium, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique floral structure and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
