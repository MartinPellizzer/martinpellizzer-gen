    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic regions of central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often on nutrient-poor soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves and is adapted to thrive in harsh, volcanic environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
