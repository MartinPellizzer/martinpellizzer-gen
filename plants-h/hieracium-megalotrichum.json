    "intro": "Hieracium megalotrichum, commonly known as the giant hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust growth and large, hairy leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
