    "intro": "Herniaria hemistemon var. parviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clustered flowers. The plant typically produces white or pale pink flowers in early summer, which are borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly plains. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and as a ground cover in dry gardens."
