    "intro": "Hibiscus subphysaloides, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hibiscus subphysaloides is often found growing on rocky outcrops and in sandy soils, adapting well to harsh, semi-desert conditions. Its botanical features make it a resilient and ornamental plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
