It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, green stems and spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of yellow or orange. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
