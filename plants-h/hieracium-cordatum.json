    "intro": "Hieracium cordatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hence the common name, and are covered in fine hairs. Hieracium cordatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
