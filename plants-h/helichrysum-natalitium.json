    "intro": "Helichrysum natalitium, commonly known as Natal Gold, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are densely packed in compact, spherical clusters. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Natal Gold is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticulture for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
