    "intro": "Helianthemum confertum var. brachypodum, commonly known as the short-stemmed rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or coastal habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
