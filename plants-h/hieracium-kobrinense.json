    "intro": "Hieracium kobrinense, commonly known as Kobrin's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows and grasslands, often in temperate regions of Europe. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
