    "intro": "Heldreichia longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved heldreichia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in length, which are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in shaded, forested environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
