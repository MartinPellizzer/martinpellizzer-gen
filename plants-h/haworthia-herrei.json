    "intro": "Haworthia herrei, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with white to pale blue markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or containers. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
