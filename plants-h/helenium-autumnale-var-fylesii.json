    "intro": "Helenium autumnale var. fylesii, commonly known as the Fyles' sneezeweed, is a striking perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features showy, orange-red to yellow-orange ray florets surrounded by a dense, spiky disk of yellow tubular flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers moist, well-drained soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental value in gardens and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
