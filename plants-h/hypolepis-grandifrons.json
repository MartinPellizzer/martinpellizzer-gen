    "intro": "Hypolepis grandifrons, commonly known as the giant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, feathery fronds that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies. Its rhizomes form dense colonies, contributing to its ability to colonize wetlands and stream banks. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Dryopteridaceae family."
