    "intro": "Hippocratea kappleriana, commonly known as the Kappler's hippocratea, is a striking flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with dark green, ovate leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or red, bloom in clusters and are highly attractive to pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, Hippocratea kappleriana is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
