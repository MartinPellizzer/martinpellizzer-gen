    "intro": "Helianthemum canadense var. sabulonum, commonly known as sandstone sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands or along coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable plant for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
