    "intro": "Humboltia recurva, commonly known as the California redshank, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its distinctive red flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Humboltia recurva is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coast, often in areas with strong ocean breezes."
