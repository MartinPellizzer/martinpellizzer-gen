    "intro": "Helichrysum forskahlii var. forskahlii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features wiry, branched stems and dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
