    "intro": "Haageocereus decumbens var. brevispinus, commonly known as the short-spined hedgehog cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming cactus with pale green stems that are covered in short, stiff spines. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping in dry climates."
