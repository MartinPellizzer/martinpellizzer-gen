    "intro": "Heteropterys rufula, commonly known as the roughleaf woodbine, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Mexico and Central America. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Heteropterys rufula is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
