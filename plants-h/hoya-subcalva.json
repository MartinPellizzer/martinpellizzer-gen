    "intro": "Hoya subcalva, commonly known as the \"naked hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid tropical environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. Hoya subcalva is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
