It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows. It has a rosette growth form, with basal leaves that are typically lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Due to its habitat, it is adapted to cold climates and is relatively drought-tolerant."
