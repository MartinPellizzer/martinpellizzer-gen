It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with trailing stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round, woody fruits. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth texture with a slightly glossy surface. Hendecandra procumbens is valued for its aromatic wood and is often used in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
