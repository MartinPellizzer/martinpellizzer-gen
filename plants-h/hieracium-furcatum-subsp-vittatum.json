    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum subsp. vittatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a distinctive central disk and surrounding ray florets. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
