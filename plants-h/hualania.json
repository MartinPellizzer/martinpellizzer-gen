    "intro": "Hualania, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bright yellow spore cases that resemble small stars. The plant has a delicate, creeping rhizome with feathery fronds that are typically green with a slight blue or silver hue. Hualania thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires consistent moisture and high air humidity to flourish. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is considered a valuable specimen in horticulture."
