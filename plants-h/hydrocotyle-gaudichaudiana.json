    "intro": "Hydrocotyle gaudichaudiana, commonly known as the giant water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and marshes. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a distinctive white or pale underside that reflects light. Hydrocotyle gaudichaudiana plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
