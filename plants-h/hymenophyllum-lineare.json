It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central midrib and a dense arrangement of tiny, scale-like leaves along its edges. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate morphology and specialized adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
