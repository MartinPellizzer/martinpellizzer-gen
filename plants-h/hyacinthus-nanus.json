    "intro": "Hyacinthus nanus, commonly known as the dwarf hyacinth, is a compact, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often used in landscaping for its vibrant, early-season display."
