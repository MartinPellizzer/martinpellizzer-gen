    "intro": "Hieracium pseudospeireum, commonly known as the false spearthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is found in various regions across Europe and parts of Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its appearance, it is often mistaken for other thistle species, but it is distinguished by its unique floral structure and growth habits."
