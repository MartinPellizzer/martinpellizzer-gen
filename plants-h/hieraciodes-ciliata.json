It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies.
