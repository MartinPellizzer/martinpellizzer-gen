    "intro": "Hetaeria wenzelii, commonly known as the Wenzel's spider orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, intricate flowers that resemble spiders, hence its common name. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, producing pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, elongated labellum. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hetaeria wenzelii is considered a vulnerable species."
