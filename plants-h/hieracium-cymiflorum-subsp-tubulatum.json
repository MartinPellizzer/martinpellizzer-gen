    "intro": "Hieracium cymiflorum subsp. tubulatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a tall, flowering stem. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a cymule inflorescence. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in flower structure and leaf arrangement."
