    "intro": "Holopetalum, commonly known as the \"lady's mantle,\" is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Saxifragaceae. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and showy, clustered flowers that often appear in late spring or early summer. The flowers are typically pink, red, or white, with five petals that are fused at the base, giving the plant its scientific name. Holopetalum species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate appearance."
