    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale subsp. mackenziei, commonly known as Mackenzie's vernal pea, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in slender pods and are adapted to disperse in cold climates. This subspecies is well-suited to nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats."
