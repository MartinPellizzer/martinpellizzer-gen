    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. argillaceitropum, commonly known as the clay-loving hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with hairy stems and basal leaves. Its subspecies is distinguished by its preference for clay-rich substrates and slightly different morphological characteristics compared to other hawkweed species. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
