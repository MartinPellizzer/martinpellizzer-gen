    "intro": "Haloschoenus albidus, commonly known as the white saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, white or pale green leaves that are adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its root system is extensive and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important species in ecological restoration. Haloschoenus albidus is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline or alkaline soils."
