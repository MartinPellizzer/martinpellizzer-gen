    "intro": "Hieracium pseudonigrescens, commonly known as the dark false hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets that turn reddish-brown as they age. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
