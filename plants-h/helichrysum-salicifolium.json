It features small, bright yellow flowers that are tightly packed into dense, spherical clusters. The plant has slender, willow-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, silvery appearance. It is well adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in coastal regions. The foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and aesthetic appeal."
