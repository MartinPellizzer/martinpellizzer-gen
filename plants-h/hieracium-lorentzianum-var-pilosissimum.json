It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is notable for its dense, hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps in identifying it in the field. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
