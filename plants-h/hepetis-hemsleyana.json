    "intro": "Hepetis hemsleyana, commonly known as the Hemsley's bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking blue to purple tubular flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or woodland settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and the presence of nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators."
