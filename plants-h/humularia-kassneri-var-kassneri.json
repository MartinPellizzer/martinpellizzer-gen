It is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family, characterized by its unique morphology and ecological adaptations. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical forests. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species with limited research on its botanical characteristics."
