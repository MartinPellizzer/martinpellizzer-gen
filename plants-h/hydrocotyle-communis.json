    "intro": "Hydrocotyle communis, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. Its root system helps stabilize soil in aquatic habitats, making it ecologically significant. Hydrocotyle communis is often used in water gardens and is also a food source for various aquatic organisms."
