It belongs to the family Dicranaceae and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, elongated leaves. The plant's distinctive feature is its cup-like structures, which are formed by the arrangement of its leaf cells. Hymenocrater oxyodontus typically grows on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short stalks and release spores when mature."
