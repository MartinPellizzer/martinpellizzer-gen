    "intro": "Heleniastrum glaucum, commonly known as the blueweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with gray-green, hairy foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, blue to purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heleniastrum glaucum is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient plant in desert ecosystems."
