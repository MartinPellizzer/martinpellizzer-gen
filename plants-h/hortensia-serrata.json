    "intro": "Hortensia serrata, commonly known as the serrated hortensia, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that range from white to deep purple, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into round, woody fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are serrated and have a medium to dark green color, providing a striking contrast to its floral displays. Hortensia serrata prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
