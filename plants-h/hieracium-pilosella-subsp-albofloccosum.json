    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. albofloccosum, commonly known as the white flocculent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and finely divided leaves. The plant features a rosette of basal, soft, hairy leaves that are often pale green, and its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, forming a dense, fluffy appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
