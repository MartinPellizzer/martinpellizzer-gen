    "intro": "Huperzia socratis, commonly known as the Socratus clubmoss, is a species of primitive fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and a rosette-like growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its sporophylls are clustered in dense, cone-like structures called strobila, which produce spores for reproduction. Huperzia socratis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in horticultural settings."
