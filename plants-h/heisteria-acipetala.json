It is characterized by its small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Heisteria acipetala is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
