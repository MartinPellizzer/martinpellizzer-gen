    "intro": "Huperzia wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features whorled leaves that are often clustered at the base, giving it a club-like appearance. It reproduces via spores rather than seeds, and its life cycle includes both a gametophyte and sporophyte stage. Huperzia wilsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
