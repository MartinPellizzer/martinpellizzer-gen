    "intro": "Herniaria lenticulata, commonly known as the kidneyweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are tiny, white or pinkish, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. It is a perennial species that produces a distinctive, kidney-shaped fruit. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
