    "intro": "Homalobus microcarpus, commonly known as the small-fruited homalobus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, capsule-like fruits and palmate leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. It produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its bark is often used in traditional medicine. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some areas."
