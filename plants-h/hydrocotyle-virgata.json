    "intro": "Hydrocotyle virgata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often forming dense mats near the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has rounded, waxy leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a distinct central vein. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, blooming in late spring to early summer. Hydrocotyle virgata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
