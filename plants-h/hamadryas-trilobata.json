    "intro": "Hamadryas trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed orchid, is a unique flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive three-lobed petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or under dense canopy cover. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a fragrant scent that attracts specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
