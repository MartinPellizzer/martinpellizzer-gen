    "intro": "Hakea marginata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant has adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden winds, making it resilient in coastal environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea marginata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and unique appearance."
