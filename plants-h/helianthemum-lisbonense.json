It features small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean landscapes."
