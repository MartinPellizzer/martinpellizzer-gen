    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum var. dissidens, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive yellowish or reddish coloration. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
