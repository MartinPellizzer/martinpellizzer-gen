    "intro": "Hemipogon carassensis, commonly known as the Carassian hemipogon, is a flowering plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its herbaceous growth habit and showy, pentamerous flowers with five petals. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
