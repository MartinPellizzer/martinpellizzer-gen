    "intro": "Halerpestes tridentata, commonly known as the desert ironwood, is a slow-growing, evergreen tree native to the Sonoran Desert. It has a thick, rugged trunk with a distinctive three-lobed leaf structure, which helps it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are important for local wildlife. Its deep root system allows it to access groundwater, making it highly drought-tolerant. The wood is dense and strong, historically used by indigenous peoples for tools and construction."
