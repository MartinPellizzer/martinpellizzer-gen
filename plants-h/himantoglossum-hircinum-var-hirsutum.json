    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy yellow rattle, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients while still performing photosynthesis. It typically grows in calcareous grasslands and is found in regions of Europe, including the British Isles. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
