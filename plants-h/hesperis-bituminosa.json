    "intro": "Hesperis bituminosa, commonly known as the bituminous hornbeam, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Betulaceae family and is characterized by its small, inconspicuous flowers that appear in early spring. The plant produces small, winged seeds known as samaras, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hesperis bituminosa thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
