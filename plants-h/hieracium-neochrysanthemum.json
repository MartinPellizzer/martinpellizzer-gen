    "intro": "Hieracium neochrysanthemum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can form dense colonies. Hieracium neochrysanthemum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
