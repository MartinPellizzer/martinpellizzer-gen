    "intro": "Heteropterys byrsonimifolia var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular-leafed waxtree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in small glands, giving them a slightly waxy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and floral display."
