    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. jovimontis, commonly known as the Jovimontis hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are upright with a somewhat woolly texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
