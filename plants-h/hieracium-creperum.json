    "intro": "Hieracium creperum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in composite flower heads, which are composed of many tiny florets. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Hieracium creperum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
