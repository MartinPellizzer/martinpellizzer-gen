It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and small, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-colored flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
