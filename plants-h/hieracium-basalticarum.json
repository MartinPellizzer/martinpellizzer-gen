    "intro": "Hieracium basalticarum, commonly known as the basaltic dandelion, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, adapting to harsh environments with its robust root system. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and produce a distinctive seed dispersal mechanism. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
