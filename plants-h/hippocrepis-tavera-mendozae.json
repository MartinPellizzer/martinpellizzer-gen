    "intro": "Hippocrepis tavera-mendozae, commonly known as the Tavera-Mendoza rock orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, violet-blue floral spikes. The plant produces showy, spurred orchid flowers that are adapted for pollination by specific insect species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
