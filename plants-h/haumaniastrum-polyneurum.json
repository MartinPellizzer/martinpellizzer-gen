    "intro": "Haumaniastrum polyneurum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with contrasting red or purple markings. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind."
