    "intro": "Haageocereus decumbens, commonly known as the desert night bloomer, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit with cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its adaptations include succulent stems for water storage and a reduced leaf structure to minimize water loss. Haageocereus decumbens is well-suited to harsh desert environments and is often found in rocky soils and crevices."
