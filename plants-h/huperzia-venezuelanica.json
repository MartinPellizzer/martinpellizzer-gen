    "intro": "Huperzia venezuelanica, commonly known as the Venezuelan huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette or spiral pattern. The plant is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Venezuela and neighboring countries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Huperzia venezuelanica is notable for its lack of true roots and its ability to absorb water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces."
