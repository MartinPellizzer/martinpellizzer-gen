    "intro": "Helianthus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the scarlet pearly everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright orange to red flowers and silver-gray foliage, which give it a striking appearance. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Helianthus erythrocarpus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
