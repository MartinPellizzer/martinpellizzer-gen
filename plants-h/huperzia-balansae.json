It is a terrestrial fern-like plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has slender, upright stems with small, scale-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls. Huperzia balansae is characterized by its distinctive, elongated spore-bearing structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of the stems. This species is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ecological role in soil stabilization and habitat provision."
