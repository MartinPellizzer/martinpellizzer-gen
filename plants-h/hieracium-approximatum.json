    "intro": "Hieracium approximatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium approximatum is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
