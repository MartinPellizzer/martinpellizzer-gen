    "intro": "Hedyotis parvula, commonly known as small flameflower, is a small herbaceous perennial native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, ascending stems that often branch near the base, supporting small, opposite leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bright red flowers with four petals, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate foliage and vibrant floral display."
