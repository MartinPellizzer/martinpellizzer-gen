It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is typically found in humid, tropical environments. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and hairy foliage, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. It produces white or pale yellow flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hirtella brachystachya is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
