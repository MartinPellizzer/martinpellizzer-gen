    "intro": "Hieracium taurinense subsp. taurinense, commonly known as the Taurine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, disk-shaped flowers surrounded by ray florets. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
