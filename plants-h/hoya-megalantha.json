    "intro": "Hoya megalantha, commonly known as the giant wax plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces large, leathery leaves that are often variegated with cream or yellow markings. Hoya megalantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
