    "intro": "Habenaria marquisensis subsp. hallei, commonly known as the Marquis's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its morphology includes a slender rhizome and a single, narrow leaf, with the inflorescence bearing several small, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
