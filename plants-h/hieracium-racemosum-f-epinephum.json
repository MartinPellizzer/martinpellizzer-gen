    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum f. epinephum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a variant of the common hawkweed. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces a tall, branched stem with yellow flowers. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This form is notable for its reduced leaf size and pale coloration compared to the typical form of H. racemosum."
