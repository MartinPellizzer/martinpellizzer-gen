    "intro": "Hieracium cirritum subsp. tenellum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers with a central cluster of tiny florets, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. The subspecies tenellum is distinguished by its more slender stems and smaller, more delicate foliage compared to other variants of Hieracium cirritum."
