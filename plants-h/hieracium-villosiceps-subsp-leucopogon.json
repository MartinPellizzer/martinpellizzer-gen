    "intro": "Hieracium villosiceps subsp. leucopogon, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and ability to colonize areas quickly, it can become invasive in certain regions."
