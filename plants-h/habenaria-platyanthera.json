    "intro": "Habenaria platyanthera, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy flowers that typically bloom in late summer or early autumn. The flowers are usually pink or purple with a distinctive white lip, and they emit a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. It has a complex root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits that disperse its seeds."
