    "intro": "Hearnia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hearnia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, such as forest understories, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Hearnia lancifolia has lanceolate leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
