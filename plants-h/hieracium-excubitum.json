    "intro": "Hieracium excubitum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats, often in meadows or along streambanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium excubitum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an aggressive weed in some areas."
