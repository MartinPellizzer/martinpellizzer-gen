    "intro": "Haworthia greenii var. silvicola, commonly known as the forest haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue and white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its coloration. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
