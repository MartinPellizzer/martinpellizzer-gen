    "intro": "Habenaria juruenensis, commonly known as the Juruen orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate floral structure and vibrant coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can access the necessary light for photosynthesis. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, are adorned with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
