    "intro": "Helictotrichon cartilagineum, commonly known as the cartilage grass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its fibrous, cartilage-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
