    "intro": "Hibiscus tubiflorus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive yellow throat. The plant typically grows in swampy areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish in color. Hibiscus tubiflorus is an important species for pollinators and is also used in traditional medicine by some indigenous communities."
