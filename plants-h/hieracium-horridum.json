    "intro": "Hieracium horridum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium horridum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
