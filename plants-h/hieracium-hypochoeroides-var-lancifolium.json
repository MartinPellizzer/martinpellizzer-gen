It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
