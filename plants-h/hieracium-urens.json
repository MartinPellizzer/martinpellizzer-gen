    "intro": "Hieracium urens, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months, attracting various pollinators."
