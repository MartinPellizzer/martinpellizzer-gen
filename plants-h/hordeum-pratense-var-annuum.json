    "intro": "Hordeum pratense var. annuum, commonly known as annual bluegrass, is a cool-season grass that thrives in moist, fertile soils. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and loose, open growth habit. The plant typically reaches heights of 15 to 30 centimeters and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in lawns, pastures, and disturbed sites due to its rapid growth and adaptability. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread easily in various environments."
