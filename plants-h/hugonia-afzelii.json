    "intro": "Hugonia afzelii, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive rosette of waxy, grass-like leaves that form a tight cluster at the base. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem, giving it a wheel-like appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found near water bodies. Hugonia afzelii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and floral display."
