    "intro": "Hieracium conscissum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
