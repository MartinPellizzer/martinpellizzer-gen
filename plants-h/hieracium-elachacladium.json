    "intro": "Hieracium elachacladium, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It has spiny, lobed leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its thistle-like appearance, it is often mistaken for other similar species within the Hieracium genus."
