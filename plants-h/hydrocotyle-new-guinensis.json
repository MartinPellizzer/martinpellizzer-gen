    "intro": "Hydrocotyle new-guinensis, commonly known as the Guinean water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and striking, spadix-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, thriving in moist to aquatic environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Hydrocotyle new-guinensis is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive foliage and unique floral structure."
