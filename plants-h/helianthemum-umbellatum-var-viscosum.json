    "intro": "Helianthemum umbellatum var. viscosum, commonly known as the sticky rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen shrub form with fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in a sticky resin. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. This variety is distinguished by its viscid (sticky) foliage, which helps reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
