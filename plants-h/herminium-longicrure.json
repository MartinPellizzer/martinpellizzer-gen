    "intro": "Herminium longicrure, commonly known as the long-legged orchid, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a basal rosette, while its flowers are borne on slender pedicels. Due to its specialized habitat, Herminium longicrure is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
