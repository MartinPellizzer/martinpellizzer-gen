It features slender, erect stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its aromatic foliage and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
