    "intro": "Helleborine mairei, commonly known as the Maire's helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces striking, pale green to white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Helleborine mairei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
