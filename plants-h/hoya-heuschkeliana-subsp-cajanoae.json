    "intro": "Hoya heuschkeliana subsp. cajanoae, commonly known as the Cauca Hoya, is a climbing epiphytic plant native to Colombia. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is prized for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
