    "intro": "Herpetospermum operculatum, commonly known as the operculate herpetospermum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a waxy surface, while its flowers are usually white or pale yellow. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature that aids in its dispersal in the wild."
