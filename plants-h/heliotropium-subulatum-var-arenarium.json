    "intro": "Heliotropium subulatum var. arenarium, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant has finely serrated, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. Its unique morphology and adaptability make it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
