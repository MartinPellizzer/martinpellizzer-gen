It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
