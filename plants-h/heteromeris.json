These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly in Central and South America. Heteromeris species are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their palmate leaves and showy, often pink or red flowers. The flowers are usually bisexual and have five petals, with a distinctive calyx that is often inflated or lobed. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant blooms and unique foliage."
