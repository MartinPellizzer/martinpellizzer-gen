    "intro": "Heliotropium halacsyi, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the afternoon, giving it a sun-tracking behavior. Its leaves are usually hairy and adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging climates."
