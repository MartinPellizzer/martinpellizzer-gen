    "intro": "Herniaria fruticosa var. hemistemon, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant characterized by its small, succulent leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. The plant has a dense root system that helps stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which reduces water loss in dry conditions. This variety is well adapted to harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
