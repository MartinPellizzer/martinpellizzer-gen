The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically pale green or white, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
