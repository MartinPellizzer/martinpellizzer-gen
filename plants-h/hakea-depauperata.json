    "intro": "Hakea depauperata, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which bloom during the winter months. Hakea depauperata is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It is often used in coastal gardens due to its resilience and attractive appearance."
