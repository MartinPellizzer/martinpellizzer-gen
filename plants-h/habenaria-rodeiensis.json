    "intro": "Habenaria rodeiensis, commonly known as the Rode Island orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It produces striking, pale pink to white flowers with intricate markings that resemble the patterns of a butterfly's wings. The plant has a slender, upright stem that bears a single raceme of flowers, each with three sepals and three petals. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, sandy soils. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate and unique floral display."
