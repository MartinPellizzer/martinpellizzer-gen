    "intro": "Hymeneria obesa, commonly known as the giant puffball, is a unique plant species native to the Andes Mountains. It is characterized by its large, bulbous fruiting body that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. The plant produces a dense mass of spores within its fleshy, white to yellowish interior. It thrives in high-altitude, humid environments and is often found in grasslands and open areas. Despite its intimidating size, it is not toxic and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
