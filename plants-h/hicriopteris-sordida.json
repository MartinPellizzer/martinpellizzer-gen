    "intro": "Hicriopteris sordida, commonly known as the sordid hickory fern, is a species of fern characterized by its dark, leathery fronds. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is native to the southeastern United States. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its fronds are bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow in the dark, which aids in its nocturnal pollination. The plant's spores are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in forested areas."
