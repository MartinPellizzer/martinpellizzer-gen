    "intro": "Herminium nankotaizanense, commonly known as the Nankotaizan orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Japan. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect light. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the acidic soils of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
