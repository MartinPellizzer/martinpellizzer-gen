    "intro": "Hibiscus pavoniformis, commonly known as the rainbow hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from red to orange, yellow, and pink, often with a striking contrast between the outer petals and the inner throat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with rough, hairy stems and broad, lobed leaves. Its flowers bloom in summer and are known for their vibrant, almost iridescent appearance. Hibiscus pavoniformis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
