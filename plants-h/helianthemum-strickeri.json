It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
