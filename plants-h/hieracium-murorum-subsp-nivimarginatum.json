    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. nivimarginatum, commonly known as the snow-margin hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in open areas with full sun exposure. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is characterized by its white or pale margins on the leaves, distinguishing it from other members of the Hieracium genus."
