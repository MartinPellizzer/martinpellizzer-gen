    "intro": "Haplopappus spinulosus subsp. gooddingii, commonly known as the Goodding's hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The small yellow flowers appear in late spring and are followed by bristly, spiny pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds."
