    "intro": "Halophila tricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sea horsetail, is a species of seagrass found in coastal and estuarine environments. It thrives in brackish water conditions, making it a halophyte adapted to high salinity. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stems. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms. Halophila tricostata is also important for carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems."
