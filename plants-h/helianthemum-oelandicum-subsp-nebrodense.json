    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. nebrodense, commonly known as the Nebrodan stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the characteristic vegetation of these habitats."
