    "intro": "Hypocarpus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, often pink or white, bracteate flowers. Hypocarpus species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. They have a long history of use in traditional medicine, though many species are toxic and require careful handling."
