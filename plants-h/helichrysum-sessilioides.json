    "intro": "Helichrysum sessilioides, commonly known as the Cape gold bush, is a South African plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, sun-like flowers that remain vibrant even after drying, making it popular in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and is well adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. Helichrysum sessilioides is also valued for its aromatic properties and is used in traditional medicine."
