    "intro": "Hieracium platamodes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a tall, unbranched stem that bears yellowish-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium platamodes is a perennial species that can spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments."
