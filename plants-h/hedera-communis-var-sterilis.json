    "intro": "Hedera communis var. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that lacks the ability to produce viable seeds. This plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy in appearance. It thrives in shaded environments and is often found climbing on walls, trees, or other structures. While it shares many features with its fertile counterpart, it does not produce berries or seeds, relying instead on vegetative propagation for spread. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in shaded gardens."
