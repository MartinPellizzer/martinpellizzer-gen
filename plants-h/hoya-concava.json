    "intro": "Hoya concava, commonly known as the concave waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Hoya concava is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
