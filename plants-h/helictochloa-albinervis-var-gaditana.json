    "intro": "Helictochloa albinervis var. gaditana, commonly known as the white-veined grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with distinctive white veins. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and coastal areas. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to brown flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized grass species."
