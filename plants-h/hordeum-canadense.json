    "intro": "Hordeum canadense, commonly known as Canada wild rye, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swales, and along stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Hordeum canadense plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
