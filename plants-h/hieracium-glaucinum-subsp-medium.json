    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. medium, commonly known as the common meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are lanceolate to oblanceolate in shape, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the plant produces small, oval achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Botanically, it is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology and floral structure typical of the Asteraceae family."
