    "intro": "Hookera howellii, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a striking alpine plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help protect it from harsh weather conditions. Hookera howellii is also notable for its ability to survive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
