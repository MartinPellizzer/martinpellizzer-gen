    "intro": "Hymenophyllum francavillei, commonly known as the Frenchman's fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant reproduces through spore dispersal rather than seeds. Hymenophyllum francavillei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
