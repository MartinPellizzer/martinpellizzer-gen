    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudum subsp. maranzae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It has a hairy stem and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
