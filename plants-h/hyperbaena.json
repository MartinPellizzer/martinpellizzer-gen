    "intro": "Hyperbaena, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gentianaceae. It consists of several species, primarily native to Africa, with some found in the Middle East and southern Europe. The plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and showy, tubular or bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are often brightly colored, ranging from blue to purple, and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hyperbaena species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking floral display."
