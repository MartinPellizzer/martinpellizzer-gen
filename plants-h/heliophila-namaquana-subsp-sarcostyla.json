It is characterized by its succulent, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats.
