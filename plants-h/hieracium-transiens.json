    "intro": "Hieracium transiens, commonly known as the transient hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring moist and temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium transiens is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
