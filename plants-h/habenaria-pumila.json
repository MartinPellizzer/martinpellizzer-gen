    "intro": "Habenaria pumila, commonly known as the small-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and has a delicate, slender stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its compact growth habit. Habenaria pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in specialty gardens."
