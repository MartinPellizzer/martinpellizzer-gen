It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, covered in a fine layer of whitish wax. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months, adding a bright touch to rocky or coastal habitats. It is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and thrives in well-drained soils. This variety is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant in arid landscapes."
