    "intro": "Hydnophytum subrotundum, commonly known as the bladderleaf or velvetleaf, is a unique tropical plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bladder-like leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant is hemiepiphytic, meaning it begins its life on the forest floor but can climb trees as it matures. Its flowers are small and clustered, often greenish or yellowish in color, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Hydnophytum subrotundum is typically found in shaded, humid environments of tropical rainforests."
