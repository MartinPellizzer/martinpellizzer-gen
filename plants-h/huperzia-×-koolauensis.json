    "intro": "Huperzia \u00d7 koolauensis, commonly known as the Koolau huperzia, is a hybrid fern belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is native to the Hawaiian Islands and is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that form dense, low-growing mats. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. This species is of interest to botanists due to its unique hybrid origin and ecological adaptations."
