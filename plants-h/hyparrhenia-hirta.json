    "intro": "Hyparrhenia hirta, commonly known as hairy flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale green or brown, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hyparrhenia hirta is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
