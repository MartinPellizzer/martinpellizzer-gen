    "intro": "Hieracium stoechadum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hieracium stoechadum is adapted to withstand salty sea winds and is an important component of coastal ecosystems."
