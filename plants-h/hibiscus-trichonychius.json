It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus trichonychius thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and waste lands. It is also cultivated for its ornamental value and has traditional uses in some cultures."
