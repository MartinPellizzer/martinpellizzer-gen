    "intro": "Hieracium austroslavicum, commonly known as the Slavonic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, sandy or loamy soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
