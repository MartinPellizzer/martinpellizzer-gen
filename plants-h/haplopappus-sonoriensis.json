    "intro": "Haplopappus sonoriensis, commonly known as the Sonoran pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Haplopappus sonoriensis is well adapted to desert conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
