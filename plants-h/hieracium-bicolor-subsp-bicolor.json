    "intro": "Hieracium bicolor subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and tubular disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some habitats."
