    "intro": "Hygrochilus parishii, commonly known as the Parry's hygrochilus, is a rare and specialized orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers that are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
