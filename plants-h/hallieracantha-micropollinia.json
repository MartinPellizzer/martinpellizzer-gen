    "intro": "Hallieracantha micropollinia, commonly known as the small-pollen orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its compact, terrestrial growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with intricate petal structures. The plant's pollination mechanism involves specialized structures called micropollinia, which are tiny pollen masses that adhere to pollinators. It typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
