    "intro": "Hammarbya, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of a single species, Hammarbya palustris, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves and its clusters of small, white or pale green flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wet meadows and woodland areas. Hammarbya is notable for its ability to tolerate wet conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
