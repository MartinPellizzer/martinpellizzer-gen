It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in boreal and subarctic regions. It has hairy, basal leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
