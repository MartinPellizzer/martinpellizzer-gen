    "intro": "Hordeum distichon subsp. nutans, commonly known as the nodding barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and compact, nodding inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, two-rowed spikelets, typical of the Poaceae family, and has narrow, linear leaves with a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its potential use in forage and bioenergy applications."
