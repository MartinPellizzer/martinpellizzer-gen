    "intro": "Holcus gryllus, commonly known as the cock's-comb grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery inflorescence that resembles a cock's comb, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a rough texture, and it produces small, spikelet-based flowers. Holcus gryllus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
