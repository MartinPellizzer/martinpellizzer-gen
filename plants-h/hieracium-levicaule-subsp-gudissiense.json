    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. gudissiense, commonly known as the Gudissi hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the eastern Himalayas. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a hairy surface. Its flowering stems bear yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in its native ecosystem."
