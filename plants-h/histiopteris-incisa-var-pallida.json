    "intro": "Histiopteris incisa var. pallida, commonly known as the pale fringed holly fern, is a variant of the fringed holly fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are finely divided and often have a pale or whitish underside. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter. The pale variegation of its fronds makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
