    "intro": "Helianthus lindheimerianus, commonly known as Lindheimer's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and thrives in dry, rocky soils. The plant features upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers with a prominent central disk. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its habitat."
