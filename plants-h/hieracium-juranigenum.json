It typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and forest edges. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium juranigenum is often found in alpine and subalpine zones, where it thrives in cooler, humid conditions."
