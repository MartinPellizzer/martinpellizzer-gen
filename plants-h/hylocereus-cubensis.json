    "intro": "Hylocereus cubensis, commonly known as the pitaya or dragon fruit, is a cactus species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its climbing habit and distinctive, fleshy, spiny stems. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often opening at night. Its fruit, which is typically bright yellow or red with a vibrant pink exterior, is rich in nutrients and antioxidants. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
