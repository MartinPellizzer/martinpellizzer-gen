    "intro": "Heterotoma cordifolia var. tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heartleaf, is a variant of the heartleaf plant native to certain regions of South America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its lanceolate, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, blooming during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. The botanical interest of this variant lies in its unique leaf morphology and its adaptation to arid environments."
