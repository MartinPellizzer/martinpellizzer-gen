It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties have been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
