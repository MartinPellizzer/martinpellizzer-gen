    "intro": "Heliophila setacea, commonly known as the slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Heliophila setacea thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a low-growing, spreading form that makes it suitable for ground cover in moist gardens."
