    "intro": "Hieracium setigerum var. hispanicum, commonly known as the Spanish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
