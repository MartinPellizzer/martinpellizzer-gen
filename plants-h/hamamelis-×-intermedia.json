    "intro": "Hamamelis \u00d7 intermedia, commonly known as the hybrid witch hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is a cross between Hamamelis virginiana and Hamamelis mollis, resulting in a plant that combines the best traits of both parents. The species is characterized by its striking, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have serrated edges, turning yellow in the fall. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
