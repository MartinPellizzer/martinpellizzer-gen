    "intro": "Hieracium allionii, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. Hieracium allionii is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize new areas rapidly."
