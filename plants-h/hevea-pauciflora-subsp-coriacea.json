    "intro": "Hevea pauciflora subsp. coriacea, commonly known as the rough hevea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing sticky, latex-rich seeds. It is valued for its latex, which has industrial applications, and for its hardy, drought-resistant nature. The subspecies is often found in lowland rainforests and is an important component of the region's biodiversity."
