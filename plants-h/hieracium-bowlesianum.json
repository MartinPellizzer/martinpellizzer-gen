    "intro": "Hieracium bowlesianum, commonly known as the Bowles' hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
