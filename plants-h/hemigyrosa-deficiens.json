    "intro": "Hemigyrosa deficiens, commonly known as the incomplete spiral fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit a spiral arrangement, though they lack the full development seen in other members of its family. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical or subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and delicate, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemigyrosa deficiens is considered a species of conservation concern."
