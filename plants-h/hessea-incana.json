    "intro": "Hessea incana, commonly known as the hairy hessian, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, clustered white flowers. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hessea incana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
