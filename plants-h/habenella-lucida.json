    "intro": "Habenella lucida, commonly known as the luminous liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafy structure and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a unique growth form with a prostrate stem and closely arranged, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its reproductive structures, known as gametophores, are specialized for sexual reproduction and are often clustered near the base of the plant. Habenella lucida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
