    "intro": "Hesperis novakii subsp. novakii, commonly known as the Sierra White Campion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and capsule fruits. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. Its leaves are basal and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The Sierra White Campion is often found in open meadows and along streambanks, where it thrives in full sun."
