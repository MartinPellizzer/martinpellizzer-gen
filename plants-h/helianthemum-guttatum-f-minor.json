    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum f. minor, commonly known as the dwarf stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring, adding a bright touch to rocky or gravelly soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
