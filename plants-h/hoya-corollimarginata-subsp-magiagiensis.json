    "intro": "Hoya corollimarginata subsp. magiagiensis, commonly known as the Maggiagiensis Waffle Plant, is a compact, trailing evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves with a distinctive wavy margin and a pale green to bluish-green coloration. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
