    "intro": "Heliosperma carpaticum, commonly known as the Carpathian sunspore, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Carpathian Basin. It is a perennial herb with distinctive, waxy, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered vulnerable and requires careful protection."
