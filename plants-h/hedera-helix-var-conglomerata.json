It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a glossy green, with a slightly variegated appearance in some cultivars. This plant is well-suited for hanging baskets, rockeries, or as a ground cover due to its ability to spread horizontally. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires moderate moisture, making it a versatile choice for indoor and outdoor gardening. Its botanical appeal lies in its compact form and adaptability to various growing conditions."
