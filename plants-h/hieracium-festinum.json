    "intro": "Hieracium festinum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium festinum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and an indicator of soil disturbance."
