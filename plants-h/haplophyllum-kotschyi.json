    "intro": "Haplophyllum kotschyi, commonly known as the rock rose or desert holly, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often growing on cliffs or in crevices, and is well adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in spring or early summer. Haplophyllum kotschyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
