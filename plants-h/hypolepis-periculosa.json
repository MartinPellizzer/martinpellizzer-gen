    "intro": "Hypolepis periculosa, commonly known as the dangerous holly fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately compound fronds that are often adorned with small, spore-producing structures called sori. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its fronds are typically dark green with a slightly glossy texture, and the plant can grow up to several feet in height. Hypolepis periculosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful handling due to its potentially irritant properties."
