    "intro": "Hilaria, commonly known as the \"blue grass\" or \"dwarf bluegrass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It consists of about 20 species, most of which are native to the Americas, particularly the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. These plants are typically low-growing, with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered blue or purple flowers. Hilaria species are often found in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, drought-tolerant ground covers."
