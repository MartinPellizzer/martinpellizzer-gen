    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subpersimile, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and forms dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers are arranged in clusters, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
