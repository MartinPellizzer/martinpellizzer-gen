It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a woody capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Heterocaryum laevigatum is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
