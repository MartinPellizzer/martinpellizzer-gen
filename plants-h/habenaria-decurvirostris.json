    "intro": "Habenaria decurvirostris, commonly known as the curved beak orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, curved lip that resembles a beak. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid's morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche, making it a notable example of orchid diversity in tropical regions."
