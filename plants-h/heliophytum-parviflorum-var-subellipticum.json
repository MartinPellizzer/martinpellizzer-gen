    "intro": "Heliophytum parviflorum var. subellipticum, commonly known as the narrow-elliptic heliophytum, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warm seasons. The plant has fleshy, narrow leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to store water. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
