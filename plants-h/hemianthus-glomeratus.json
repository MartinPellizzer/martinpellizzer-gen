    "intro": "Hemianthus glomeratus, commonly known as the dwarf umbrella plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to Africa. It features dense clusters of small, rounded leaves that form a compact rosette, often floating just beneath the water surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that are typically submerged, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate light and nutrient levels. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in aquariums and ponds."
