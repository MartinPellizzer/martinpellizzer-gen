    "intro": "Hickelia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are shrubs or small trees with woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. They produce showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Hickelia species are adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss."
