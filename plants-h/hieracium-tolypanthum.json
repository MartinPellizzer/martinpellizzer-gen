It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive potential and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
