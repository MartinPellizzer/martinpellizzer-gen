    "intro": "Hydnora esculenta, commonly known as the meat flower, is a parasitic plant native to southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of Euphorbia species. The plant produces a fleshy, reddish structure that resembles meat, which attracts flies for pollination. Its flowers are odorless but emit a strong, decaying flesh smell. Hydnora esculenta is notable for its unique morphology and specialized ecological role in its habitat."
