    "intro": "Hancea pierrei, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of long, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity and habitat loss, Hancea pierrei is considered an endangered species."
