    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. gredense, commonly known as the Gredens' hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
