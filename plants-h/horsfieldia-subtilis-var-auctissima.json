It is characterized by its elegant, pendulous inflorescences and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in a range of colors including white, pink, and purple. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires high light intensity for optimal growth. Its unique floral structure and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant in horticulture."
