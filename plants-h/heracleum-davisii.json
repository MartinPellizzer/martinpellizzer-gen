    "intro": "Heracleum davisii, commonly known as the Davis hogweed, is a tall, biennial or perennial herb native to the western United States. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are thick and covered in coarse hairs, often reddish in color. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
