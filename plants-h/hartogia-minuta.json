    "intro": "Hartogia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf hartogia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant has small, linear leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of white or pale yellow. Hartogia minuta is valued for its resilience and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental appeal."
