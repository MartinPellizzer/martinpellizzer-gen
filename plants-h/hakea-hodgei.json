    "intro": "Hakea hodgei, commonly known as the Grey Hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear during the autumn season. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. Hakea hodgei is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for native pollinators."
