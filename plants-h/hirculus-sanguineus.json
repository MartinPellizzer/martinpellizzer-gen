    "intro": "Hirculus sanguineus, commonly known as the crimson horned orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red petals and distinctive horn-like appendages on its flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom during the spring and summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
