    "intro": "Hieracium flocculipubens, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which gives it a fluffy appearance. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
