It is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red or purple berries. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hesperomeles fieldii is adapted to harsh conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
