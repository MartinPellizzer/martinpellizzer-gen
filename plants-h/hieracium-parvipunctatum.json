    "intro": "Hieracium parvipunctatum, commonly known as the small-spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with prominent central disk flowers. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
