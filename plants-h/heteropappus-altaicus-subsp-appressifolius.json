    "intro": "Heteropappus altaicus subsp. appressifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved horseweed, is a flowering plant native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in a compact inflorescence. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with thick leaves that store water and reduce transpiration. It has a taproot system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in dry meadows and grasslands, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
