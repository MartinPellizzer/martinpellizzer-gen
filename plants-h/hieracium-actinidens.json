    "intro": "Hieracium actinidens, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow-orange flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium actinidens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
