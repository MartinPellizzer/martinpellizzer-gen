    "intro": "Hieracium adulterinum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can reach heights of up to 30 centimeters. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
