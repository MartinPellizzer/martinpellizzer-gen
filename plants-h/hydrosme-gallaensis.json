    "intro": "Hydrosme gallaensis, commonly known as the Gallaean hydrosme, is a flowering plant species native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hydrosme gallaensis is adapted to cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
