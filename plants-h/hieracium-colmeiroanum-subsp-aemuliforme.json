It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous ray florets that bloom in late summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain habitats."
