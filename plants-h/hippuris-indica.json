    "intro": "Hippuris indica, commonly known as the Indian water plant, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, while its roots anchor it to the substrate. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically submerged or just below the water's surface. Hippuris indica is noted for its ability to purify water and is often used in phytoremediation efforts."
