    "intro": "Heliophila cuneata, commonly known as the narrowleaf heliophila, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Heliophila cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
