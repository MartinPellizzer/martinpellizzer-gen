    "intro": "Hoya reynosae, commonly known as the Rainforest Wreath, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees or rocks rather than in soil. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya reynosae is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a home setting."
