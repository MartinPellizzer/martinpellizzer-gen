    "intro": "Hedysarum adscendens, commonly known as the climbing sweet clover, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with tendrils that allow it to ascend supports such as fences or trellises. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are alternate and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Hedysarum adscendens is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial in ecological restoration projects."
