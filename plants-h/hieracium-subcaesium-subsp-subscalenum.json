    "intro": "Hieracium subcaesium subsp. subscalenum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically features linear, hairy leaves and produces small, daisy-like composite flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
