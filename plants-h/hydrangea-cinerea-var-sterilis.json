    "intro": "Hydrangea cinerea var. sterilis, commonly known as the silverleaf hydrangea, is a rare and less commonly cultivated variant of the hydrangea genus. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that bloom in late spring. This plant prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, depending on soil pH, and it is noted for its compact growth habit. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in woodland areas and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
