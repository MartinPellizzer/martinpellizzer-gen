    "intro": "Haplopappus humilis, commonly known as the slender pappus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant features small, yellowish to white flowers arranged in clusters, with slender, hairless stems that often lie flat on the ground. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplopappus humilis is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
