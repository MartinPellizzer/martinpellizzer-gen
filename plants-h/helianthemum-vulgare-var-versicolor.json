    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. versicolor, commonly known as the variable rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub that produces clusters of showy, colorful flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat."
