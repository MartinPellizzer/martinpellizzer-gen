It is characterized by its dense, spiraled arrangement of pale green to white flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its delicate, fragrant blooms."
