    "intro": "Hieracium nigriceps subsp. fasciculatum, commonly known as the black-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are characteristic of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
