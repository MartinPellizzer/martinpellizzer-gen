    "intro": "Hebeclinium gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's hebeclinium, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of North America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like flower clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pale pink, bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hebeclinium gentryi is considered a species of conservation concern."
