    "intro": "Hoarea parnassioides, commonly known as the Parnassian bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features a rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, often with a white throat, during the summer months. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
