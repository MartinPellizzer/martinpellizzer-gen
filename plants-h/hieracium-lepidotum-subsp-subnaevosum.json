    "intro": "Hieracium lepidotum subsp. subnaevosum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head, which are typically surrounded by a ring of phyllaries. It thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in some regions where it outcompetes native vegetation."
