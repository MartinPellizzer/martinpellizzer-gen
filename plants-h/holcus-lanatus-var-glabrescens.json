    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
