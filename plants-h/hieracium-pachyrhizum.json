It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a robust, fleshy root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Its basal leaves are typically broad and lobed, while the flowering stems bear small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas, where it can form dense colonies."
