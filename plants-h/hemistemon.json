It features showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Hemistemon is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
