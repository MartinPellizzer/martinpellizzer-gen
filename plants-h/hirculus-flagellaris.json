    "intro": "Hirculus flagellaris, commonly known as the flagellate harebell, is a rare flowering plant characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers and slender, hairy stems. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. The plant's leaves are narrow and lanceolate, often with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers, which range in color from pale blue to violet, bloom in late spring to early summer. Hirculus flagellaris is known for its unique flagellum-like structure in its reproductive organs, which aids in pollen dispersal."
