    "intro": "Habenella heleogena, commonly known as the red spider lily, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking red flowers with a yellow center, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in moist, shaded environments. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ornamental value. However, it is also considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
