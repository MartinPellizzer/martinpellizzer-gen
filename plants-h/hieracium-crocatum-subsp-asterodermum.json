It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette growth habit with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The subspecies asterodermum is distinguished by its yellowish-green stems and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
