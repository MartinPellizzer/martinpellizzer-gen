    "intro": "Hieracium racemosiforme, commonly known as the racemose hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a racemose inflorescence, which means they are borne in a branching, elongated pattern. Hieracium racemosiforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various conditions."
