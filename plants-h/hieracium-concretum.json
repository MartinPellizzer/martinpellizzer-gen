    "intro": "Hieracium concretum, commonly known as the concrete hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium concretum is known for its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
