    "intro": "Hieracium rhodocoleum, commonly known as the red-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a yellow disk surrounded by reddish-brown ray florets. Hieracium rhodocoleum is often found in disturbed sites and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
