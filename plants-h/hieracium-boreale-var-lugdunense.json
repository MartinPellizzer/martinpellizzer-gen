    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. lugdunense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
