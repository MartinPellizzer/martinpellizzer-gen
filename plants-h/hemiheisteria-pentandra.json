    "intro": "Hemiheisteria pentandra, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark reddish-brown heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic qualities. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are ovate to elliptic in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species in many regions."
