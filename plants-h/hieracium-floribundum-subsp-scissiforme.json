    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum subsp. scissiforme, commonly known as the cutleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its deeply lobed, often cut-like leaves, which give it its common name. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and the plant typically grows in meadows and grassy areas. This species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
