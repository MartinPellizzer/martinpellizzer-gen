It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, characterized by its simple, ovate leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually bright red or orange with a prominent yellow throat, and they bloom during the summer months. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hibiscus brachysiphonius is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
