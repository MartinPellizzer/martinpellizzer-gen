    "intro": "Hirtella triandra subsp. media, commonly known as the Brazilian peppertree, is a shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. It is adapted to a variety of soil types and can thrive in both wet and dry conditions. However, it is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
