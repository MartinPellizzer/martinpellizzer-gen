    "intro": "Haworthia fusca, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall stems, usually in shades of yellow or orange. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. Haworthia fusca is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
