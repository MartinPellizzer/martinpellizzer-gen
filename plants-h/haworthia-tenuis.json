It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Haworthia tenuis is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
