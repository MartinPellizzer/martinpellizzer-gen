The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological gardens."
