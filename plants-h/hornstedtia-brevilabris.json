    "intro": "Hornstedtia brevilabris, commonly known as the narrow-lipped hornstedtia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a unique lip structure that distinguishes it from other orchid species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
