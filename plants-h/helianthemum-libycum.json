    "intro": "Helianthemum libycum, commonly known as the Libyan sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to harsh, sun-exposed conditions typical of its native range."
