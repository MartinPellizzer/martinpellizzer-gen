It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense spikes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and blade-like, with a smooth texture and a tendency to curl at the edges. Herpestis marginata thrives in wet or moist soils, often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds or streams."
