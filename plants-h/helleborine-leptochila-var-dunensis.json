    "intro": "Helleborine leptochila var. dunensis, commonly known as the Duneland helleborine, is a rare and delicate orchid native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a mycorrhizal relationship with fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. The plant is protected in many areas due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity."
