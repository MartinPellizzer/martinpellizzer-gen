    "intro": "Heteropogon contortus var. hispidissimus, commonly known as the hairy false brome, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces spikelets that are loosely arranged along the stem, with each containing two to three flowering glumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. This variety is notable for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
