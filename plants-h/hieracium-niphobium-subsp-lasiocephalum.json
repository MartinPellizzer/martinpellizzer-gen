    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. lasiocephalum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stem and leaves, which helps protect it from cold and wind. It thrives in rocky, nutrient-poor soils at high altitudes. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions."
