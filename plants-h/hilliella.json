    "intro": "Hilliella, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species that are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their thick, fleshy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. Hilliella species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often storing water in their stems and leaves. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to their drought tolerance."
