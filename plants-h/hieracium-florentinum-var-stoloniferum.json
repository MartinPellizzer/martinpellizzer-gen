    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It spreads via stolons, allowing it to form dense mats in disturbed soils. This variant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
