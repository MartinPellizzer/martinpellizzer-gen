    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. ulotrichum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its subspecific name *ulotrichum*. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flower heads, typical of the dandelion-like composite flowers found in the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in temperate regions of Europe. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance and aiding in water retention."
