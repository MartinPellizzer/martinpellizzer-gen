It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and it has hairy, rough stems and basal leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habits."
