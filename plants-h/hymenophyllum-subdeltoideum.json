    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subdeltoideum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features delicate, lanceolate to ovate leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, with a prominent midrib and serrated margins. It produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of the leaves, which are enclosed in small, cup-like structures called indusia. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical forests."
