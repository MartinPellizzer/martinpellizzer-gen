    "intro": "Hepatica nobilis var. obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its palmate leaves that are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, often appearing in early spring. The flowers are followed by small, greenish berries that mature to a dark red or black color. This species thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
