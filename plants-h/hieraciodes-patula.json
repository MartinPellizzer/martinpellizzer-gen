    "intro": "Hieraciodes patula, commonly known as the common sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of tiny, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
