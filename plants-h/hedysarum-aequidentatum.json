    "intro": "Hedysarum aequidentatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Hedysarum aequidentatum plays a role in soil stabilization and is used in some traditional herbal remedies."
