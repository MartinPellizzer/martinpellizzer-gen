    "intro": "Hypericum cerastoides f. microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved St. John's wort, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it a dense, mat-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, and the stems are woody and somewhat succulent. This form is notable for its smaller leaves compared to the typical species, making it a distinctive variation within the genus Hypericum."
