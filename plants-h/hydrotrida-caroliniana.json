    "intro": "Hydrotrida caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina water willow, is a herbaceous wetland plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, thread-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality by filtering sediments. Hydrotrida caroliniana plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and other wildlife."
