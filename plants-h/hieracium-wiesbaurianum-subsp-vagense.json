    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. vagense, commonly known as the wandering hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and milky sap. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and has a rosette of basal leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, winged seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
