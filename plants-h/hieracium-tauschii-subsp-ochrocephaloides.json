    "intro": "Hieracium tauschii subsp. ochrocephaloides, commonly known as the yellow-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant has rough, hairy foliage and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habits."
