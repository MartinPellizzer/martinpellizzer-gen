    "intro": "Hordeum nepalense, commonly known as Nepal barley, is a species of grass native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. Hordeum nepalense is of interest to botanists and conservationists due to its limited distribution and ecological significance in high-altitude ecosystems."
