It features attractive, palmate leaves that are typically green with red or purple margins, which become more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the growing season."
