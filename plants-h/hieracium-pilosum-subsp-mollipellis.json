    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum subsp. mollipellis, commonly known as the downy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
