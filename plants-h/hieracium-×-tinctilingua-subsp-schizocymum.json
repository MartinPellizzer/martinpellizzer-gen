    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 tinctilingua subsp. schizocymum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a hybrid plant within the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
