    "intro": "Hymenophyllum blumeanum var. novoguineense, commonly known as the New Guinea shield fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of New Guinea. It features a compact, rosette-like growth form with small, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are densely covered in fine, silky hairs. The leaves are typically green to bluish-green, and the plant produces sporangia on the underside of the fronds, which are clustered in sori. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rock surfaces. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical gardens."
