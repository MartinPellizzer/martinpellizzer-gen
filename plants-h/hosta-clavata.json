It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are often marked with creamy or white veins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple during the summer months. It prefers partial to full shade and well-drained, moist soil. Hosta clavata is a popular choice for shady garden beds due to its ornamental foliage and moderate care requirements."
