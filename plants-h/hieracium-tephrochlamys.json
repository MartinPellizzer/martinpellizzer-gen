    "intro": "Hieracium tephrochlamys, commonly known as the tephrochlamys hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers with a distinctive, hairy appearance, and its leaves are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
