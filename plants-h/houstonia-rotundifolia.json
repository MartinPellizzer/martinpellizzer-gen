    "intro": "Houstonia rotundifolia, commonly known as the roundleaf bluemink, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and clusters of delicate, sky-blue to violet flowers. The plant features rounded, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch in length. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks. Houstonia rotundifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
