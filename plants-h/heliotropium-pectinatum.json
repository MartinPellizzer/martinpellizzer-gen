It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and clusters of small, purple or pink flowers that bloom in the evening. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Heliotropium pectinatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
