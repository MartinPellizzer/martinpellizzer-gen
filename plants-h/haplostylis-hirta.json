    "intro": "Haplostylis hirta, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are short and often covered in fine hairs, giving it a hairy appearance. Haplostylis hirta is primarily found in temperate regions and plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling."
