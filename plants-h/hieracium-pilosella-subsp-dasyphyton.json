    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. dasyphyton, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with hairy surfaces, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This subspecies is characterized by its dense foliage and is often found in moist or semi-shaded environments."
