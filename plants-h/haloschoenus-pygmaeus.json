    "intro": "Haloschoenus pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf saltbush, is a small shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and inland salt-affected areas. Its flowers are small and greenish, typically appearing in late spring or early summer. Haloschoenus pygmaeus plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife in its ecosystem."
