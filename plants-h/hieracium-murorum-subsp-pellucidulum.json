    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pellucidulum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its subtle appearance, it can be challenging to distinguish from other hawkweed species without careful examination."
