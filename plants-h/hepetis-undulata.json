It is characterized by its distinctive, wavy-edged leaves that are typically bright green with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, woodland soils and prefers partial to full shade. Hepetis undulata is a valuable plant for wildlife, providing nectar for early pollinators like bees and butterflies."
