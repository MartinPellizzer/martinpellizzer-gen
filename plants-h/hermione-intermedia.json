It features heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
