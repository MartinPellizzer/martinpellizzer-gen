It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers with prominent, showy stamens, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal gardens. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
