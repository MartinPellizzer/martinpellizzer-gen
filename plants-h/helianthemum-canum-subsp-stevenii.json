It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions typical of its native habitat."
