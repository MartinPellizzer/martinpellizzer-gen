    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hispidula, commonly known as hairy water shield, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, dark blue berries that are edible for some wildlife. Hydrocotyle hispidula plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
