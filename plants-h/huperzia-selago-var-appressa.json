    "intro": "Huperzia selago var. appressa, commonly known as the dwarf rock huperzia, is a low-growing fern that thrives in rocky, shaded environments. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in crevices or on rocky slopes. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to colonize difficult terrain, making it a common sight in alpine and woodland habitats."
