    "intro": "Helianthus glutinosus, commonly known as sticky sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is native to the southeastern United States and is characterized by its sticky, glandular leaves and yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The sticky hairs on its leaves are a distinctive botanical feature that helps in water retention and may deter herbivores."
