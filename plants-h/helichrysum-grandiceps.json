It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that remain open for an extended period, giving it its common name. The plant has aromatic, hairy leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to retain its color after drying makes it a favored plant for floral arrangements."
