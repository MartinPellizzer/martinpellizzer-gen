    "intro": "Hierochloe borealis var. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant northern hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-like inflorescences that are often fragrant. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is an important component of tundra and alpine ecosystems. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to extreme environmental conditions."
