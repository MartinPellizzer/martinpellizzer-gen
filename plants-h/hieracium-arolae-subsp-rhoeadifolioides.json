    "intro": "Hieracium arolae subsp. rhoeadifolioides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies name, *rhoeadifolioides*, reflects the leaf morphology resembling that of *Rhoeadium*, another genus in the same family. This species is often found in mountainous areas of the Pyrenees, Alps, and Carpathians."
