It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its woody structure and distinctive leaf morphology. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits that set it apart from closely related species. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, with a structure that facilitates specific pollination mechanisms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoehnephytum almasense is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
