    "intro": "Haplolobus sarawakanus, commonly known as the Sarawak starfruit, is a unique tropical plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, contributing to its ornamental value. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy surface, while the fruit develops from a single ovary and contains a central core. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Haplolobus sarawakanus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
