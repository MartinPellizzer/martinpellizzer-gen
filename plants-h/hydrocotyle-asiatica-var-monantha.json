    "intro": "Hydrocotyle asiatica var. monantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces tiny white flowers that bloom above the water, often in the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
