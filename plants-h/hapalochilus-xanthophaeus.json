It features a basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow-centered daisies with white petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its compact growth habit and long flowering period make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
