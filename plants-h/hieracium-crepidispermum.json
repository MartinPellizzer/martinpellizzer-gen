It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Hieracium crepidispermum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
