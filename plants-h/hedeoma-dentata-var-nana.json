It features small, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are toothed along the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its aromatic leaves and showy flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
