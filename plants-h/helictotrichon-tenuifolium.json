It features fine, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with delicate blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, prairies, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
