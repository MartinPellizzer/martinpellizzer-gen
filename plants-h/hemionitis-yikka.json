    "intro": "Hemionitis yikka, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in high-altitude environments. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typically developing on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis yikka is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
