    "intro": "Hoffmannia chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas hoffmannia, is a flowering plant species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoffmannia chiapensis is considered a rare and endangered species."
