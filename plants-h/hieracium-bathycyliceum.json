    "intro": "Hieracium bathycyliceum, commonly known as the deep-cup hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its flowers are clustered in a single head, and the plant is often found in open, sunny areas at high altitudes. Hieracium bathycyliceum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
