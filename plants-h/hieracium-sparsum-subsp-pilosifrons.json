It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, white to pale brown hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain environments."
