It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. The plant features rough, hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss. Its bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of common sunflowers, bloom in summer and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Helianthus porteri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
