It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hakea iaspicula is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
