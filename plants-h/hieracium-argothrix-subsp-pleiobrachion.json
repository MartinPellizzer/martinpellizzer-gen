    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium argothrix subsp. pleiobrachion, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disc florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and poor nutrient conditions. Its subspecies name, pleiobrachion, refers to the numerous branches on its flowering stems. This species is often found in mountain meadows and is a member of the daisy family, Asteraceae."
