    "intro": "Halodule, commonly known as shoal grass, is a genus of seagrasses found primarily in tropical and subtropical coastal regions. These plants have long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically submerged in shallow waters. Halodule species are characterized by their ability to thrive in brackish and marine environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. They play a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Their reproductive structures, called spikelets, are often found in clusters at the base of the leaves."
