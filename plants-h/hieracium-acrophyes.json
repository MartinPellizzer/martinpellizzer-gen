    "intro": "Hieracium acrophyes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, this species thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Hieracium acrophyes is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh climatic conditions."
