    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. myocomum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, typical of many members of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
