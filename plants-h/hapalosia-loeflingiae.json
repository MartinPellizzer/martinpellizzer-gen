    "intro": "Hapalosia loeflingiae, commonly known as the Loefling's spurge, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family, which includes many species with milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered in complex inflorescences called cyathia. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
