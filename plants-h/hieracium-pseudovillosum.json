    "intro": "Hieracium pseudovillosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant's flowers are typically arranged in a single head, and it is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Its common name reflects the hairy texture of its leaves, which are covered in fine, soft hairs."
