    "intro": "Horsfieldia flocculosa, commonly known as the woolly orchid, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its pendulous, fleshy leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its roots are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps in moisture retention. Horsfieldia flocculosa thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in rainforests."
