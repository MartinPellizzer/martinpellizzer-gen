    "intro": "Haplopappus johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in rocky soils and open habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring, and it produces a distinctive pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus johnstonii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native range."
