    "intro": "Haworthia magnifica var. magnifica, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features distinctive, upright rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves with white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white powder, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale green flowers during the summer months. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering, making it well-suited for indoor cultivation."
