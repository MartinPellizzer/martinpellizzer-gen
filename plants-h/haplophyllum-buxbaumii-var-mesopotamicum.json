It features fleshy, thick leaves that store water, adapted to its dry environment. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a desirable addition to arid landscape designs."
