    "intro": "Hieracium subvirentisquamum, commonly known as the green-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes for seed dispersal. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
