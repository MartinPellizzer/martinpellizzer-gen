It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny suns, which bloom in spring and summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is a perennial shrub that thrives in full sun and is drought-tolerant. Its common name reflects its tendency to grow in areas with water flow, such as near streams or waterfalls."
