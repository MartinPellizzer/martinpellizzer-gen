    "intro": "Hakea steiglitziana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hakea steiglitziana is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
