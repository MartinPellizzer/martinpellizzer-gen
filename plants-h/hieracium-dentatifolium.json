    "intro": "Hieracium dentatifolium, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has small, rough, and hairy stems that often branch near the base. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
