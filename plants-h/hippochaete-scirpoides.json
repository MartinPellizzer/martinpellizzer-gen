It typically grows in marshy or aquatic environments, often forming dense stands along the edges of ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer. The plant plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
