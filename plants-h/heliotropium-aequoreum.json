    "intro": "Heliotropium aequoreum, commonly known as sea heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or erect growth habit and produces small, violet to purple flowers. The plant thrives in saline environments, often found in sandy soils along shorelines. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Heliotropium aequoreum is also known for its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations, making it a hardy species in coastal ecosystems."
