    "intro": "Hakea aurea, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea aurea is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
