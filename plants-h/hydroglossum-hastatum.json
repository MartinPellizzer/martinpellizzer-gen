    "intro": "Hydroglossum hastatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along stream banks. Hydroglossum hastatum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
