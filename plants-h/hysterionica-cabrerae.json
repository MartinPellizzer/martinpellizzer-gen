    "intro": "Hysterionica cabrerae, commonly known as the Cabrera's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers with intricate, veined petals and a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its botanical features include a sympodial growth habit and specialized roots adapted for nutrient absorption from the surrounding soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hysterionica cabrerae is considered a vulnerable species."
