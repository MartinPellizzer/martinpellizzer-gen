    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. subcallosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
