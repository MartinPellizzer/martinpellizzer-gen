    "intro": "Helianthus rigidus var. subrhomboideus, commonly known as the rigid sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native habitat. This variety is closely related to other sunflower species and shares similar botanical features such as a robust root system and robust stem structure. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
