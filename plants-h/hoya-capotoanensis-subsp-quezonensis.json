    "intro": "Hoya capotoanensis subsp. quezonensis, commonly known as the Quezon hoya, is a compact, trailing plant native to the Philippines. It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among houseplant enthusiasts due to its ornamental appeal and relatively easy care requirements."
