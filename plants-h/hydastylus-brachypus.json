    "intro": "Hydastylus brachypus, commonly known as the dwarf water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, floating leaves that provide shade and habitat for aquatic life. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots anchor it in the mud at the bottom of still or slow-moving water bodies. Hydastylus brachypus plays a vital role in maintaining water quality and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
