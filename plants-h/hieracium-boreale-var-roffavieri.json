    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. roffavieri, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth form and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and Carpathians."
