    "intro": "Hoya fetuana, commonly known as the \"Fetuana Wax Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing or trailing plant with thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white or cream markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white or pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya fetuana is well-suited for hanging baskets or shelves due to its trailing growth habit and is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and moderate watering. Its unique appearance and ease of cultivation make it a popular choice among houseplant enthusiasts."
