    "intro": "Hemionitis calomelanos, commonly known as the rock fern, is a unique aquatic plant that thrives in rocky stream environments. It has a distinctive morphology with a creeping rhizome and small, clustered fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It is adapted to fast-flowing water, with a robust root system that anchors it to substrates. Hemionitis calomelanos plays a role in stabilizing stream banks and providing microhabitats for aquatic organisms."
