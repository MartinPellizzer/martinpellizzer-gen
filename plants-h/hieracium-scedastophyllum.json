    "intro": "Hieracium scedastophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides."
