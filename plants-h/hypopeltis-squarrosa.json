    "intro": "Hypopeltis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap prey, primarily aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, still water, where it can effectively capture and digest its prey. Its leaves are often covered in a dense, woolly coating, which helps in reducing water loss and providing some protection. The species is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
