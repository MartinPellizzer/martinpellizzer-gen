    "intro": "Hordeum rigidum, commonly known as rigid wild barley, is a grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, erect growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its seeds are enclosed in bracts and are often dispersed by wind. Hordeum rigidum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
