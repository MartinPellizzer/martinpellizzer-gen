    "intro": "Holttumochloa, commonly known as the Holttum's grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical regions of the Americas, particularly in countries like Colombia and Ecuador. The plants typically have slender, tufted growth forms with narrow, grass-like leaves. They are often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where they play a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Holttumochloa species are generally small, herbaceous plants that contribute to the ecological complexity of their native environments."
