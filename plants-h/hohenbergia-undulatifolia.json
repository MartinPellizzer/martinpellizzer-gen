    "intro": "Hohenbergia undulatifolia, commonly known as the undulating hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often undulated or wavy in appearance. The plant produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that can range from red to orange. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia undulatifolia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
