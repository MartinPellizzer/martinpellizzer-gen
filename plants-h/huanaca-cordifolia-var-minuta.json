    "intro": "Huanaca cordifolia var. minuta, commonly known as the small-heart huanaca, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of violet or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
