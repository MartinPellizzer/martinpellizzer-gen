    "intro": "Hieracium hispidellum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Asteraceae). It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in grassy areas and meadows. The plant features basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium hispidellum is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
