    "intro": "Hieracium serratifrons subsp. morulum, commonly known as the serrated hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas. This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its distinctive leaf serrations and robust growth habit."
