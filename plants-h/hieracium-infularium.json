    "intro": "Hieracium infularium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts. Hieracium infularium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
