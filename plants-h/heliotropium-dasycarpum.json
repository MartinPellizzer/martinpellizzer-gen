    "intro": "Heliotropium dasycarpum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late summer or early autumn. Its fruit is a dry, capsule-like structure that contains several seeds. Heliotropium dasycarpum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including roadsides and dry woodlands."
