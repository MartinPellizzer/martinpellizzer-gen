    "intro": "Hypolepis pedata, commonly known as the rock fern or shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, and the fronds can be used as a natural mulch or for ornamental purposes. Hypolepis pedata is valued for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
