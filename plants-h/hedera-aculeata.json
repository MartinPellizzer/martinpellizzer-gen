    "intro": "Hedera aculeata, commonly known as the Ivy creeper, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically shaped like a shield, with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
