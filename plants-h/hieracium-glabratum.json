    "intro": "Hieracium glabratum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium glabratum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a notable species in ecological studies."
