    "intro": "Hechtia macdougallii, commonly known as the Macdougall's hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the states of Durango and Zacatecas, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a cluster of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Hechtia macdougallii is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping."
