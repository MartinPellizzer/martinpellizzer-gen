    "intro": "Hyparrhenia cyanescens, commonly known as blue grass or African blue grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and striking blue-green foliage that becomes more intense under full sun. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically green or pale blue in color. It is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance. Hyparrhenia cyanescens is also valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in degraded landscapes."
