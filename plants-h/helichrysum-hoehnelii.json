    "intro": "Helichrysum hoehnelii, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to thrive in arid environments. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum hoehnelii is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
