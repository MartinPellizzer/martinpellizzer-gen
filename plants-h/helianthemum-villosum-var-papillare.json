It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, gray-green foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for coastal and rocky landscapes."
