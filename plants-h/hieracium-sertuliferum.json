    "intro": "Hieracium sertuliferum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a compact cluster. Hieracium sertuliferum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
