    "intro": "Heliophila linearifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It produces small, pale yellow or greenish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Heliophila linearifolia is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
