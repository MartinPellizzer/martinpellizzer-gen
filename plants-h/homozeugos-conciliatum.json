It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its delicate, violet-colored flowers and heart-shaped leaves.

Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Homozeugos conciliatum is considered endangered in its natural range."
