    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in sunny, well-drained conditions."
