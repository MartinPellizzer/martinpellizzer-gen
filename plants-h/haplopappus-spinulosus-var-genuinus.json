It is a perennial herb with gray-green, hairy leaves and small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces achenes surrounded by bracts, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
