    "intro": "Haworthia agavoides, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, often resembling a bulbous shape. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Haworthia agavoides is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections due to its ornamental appearance and low maintenance requirements."
