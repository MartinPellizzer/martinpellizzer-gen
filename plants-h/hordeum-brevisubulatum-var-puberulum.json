It is characterized by its short, pubescent (hairy) stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and have a bluish-green hue, while the flowers are usually pale green to brown. This variety is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological resilience."
