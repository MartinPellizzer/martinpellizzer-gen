It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Heterocentron suffruticosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
