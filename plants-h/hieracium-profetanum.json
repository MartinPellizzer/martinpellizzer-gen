    "intro": "Hieracium profetanum, commonly known as the prophet's dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets, which develop into fluffy seeds for wind dispersal. Hieracium profetanum is often found in association with other members of the genus, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
