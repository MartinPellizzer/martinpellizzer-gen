    "intro": "Hepetis tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heath, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hepetis tomentosa is a valuable addition to native plant gardens due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
