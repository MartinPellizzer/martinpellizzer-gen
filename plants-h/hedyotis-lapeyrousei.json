    "intro": "Hedyotis lapeyrousei, commonly known as the yellow inchplant, is a perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Hedyotis lapeyrousei is often found in coastal or disturbed habitats due to its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
