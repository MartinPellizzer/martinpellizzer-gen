    "intro": "Herniaria polygama, commonly known as the common bladderwort, is a small, mat-forming plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often found in coastal areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it blooms from spring to early summer. Herniaria polygama is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is known for its unique adaptations to aquatic and semi-aquatic environments."
