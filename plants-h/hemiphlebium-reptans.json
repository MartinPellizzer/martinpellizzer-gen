    "intro": "Hemiphlebium reptans, commonly known as the forest fern, is a perennial plant belonging to the Aspidiaceae family. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemiphlebium reptans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its lush, evergreen foliage."
