    "intro": "Heliotropium paronychioides, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry, open habitats. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments and it is sometimes used in xeriscaping."
