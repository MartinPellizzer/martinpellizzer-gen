    "intro": "Himalaiella heteromalla, commonly known as the Himalayan sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. Himalaiella heteromalla is adapted to cold, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows at elevations above 3,000 meters."
