    "intro": "Hieracium pegodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
