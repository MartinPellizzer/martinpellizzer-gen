    "intro": "Hyoscyamus afghanicus, commonly known as Afghan henbane, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, which can be harmful if ingested. It thrives in dry, arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
