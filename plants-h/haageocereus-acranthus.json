It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant is well adapted to drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soil."
