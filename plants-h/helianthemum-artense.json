It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with succulent leaves that store water. Helianthemum artense is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value in Mediterranean climates."
