    "intro": "Hieracium limonium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium limonium is often found in moist environments and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
