    "intro": "Hackelia hintoniorum, commonly known as Hinton's firecracker, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its erect, branching stems and clusters of showy, pink to red tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds enclosed in a distinctive, inflated seedpod that splits open when mature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hackelia hintoniorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a nectar source for pollinators."
