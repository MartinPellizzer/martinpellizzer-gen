It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
