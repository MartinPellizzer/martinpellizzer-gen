    "intro": "Hieracium nigritum subsp. pseudeximium, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are grouped in clusters, and its roots are fibrous and spreading. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweeds due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by specific leaf and flower characteristics."
