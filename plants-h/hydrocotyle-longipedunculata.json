    "intro": "Hydrocotyle longipedunculata, commonly known as the slender water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with long, slender petioles. Its flowers are tiny and yellow, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Hydrocotyle longipedunculata is often used in ornamental water gardens due to its delicate appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
