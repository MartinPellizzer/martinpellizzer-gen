    "intro": "Helianthemum leptophyllum subsp. alypoides, commonly known as the alpine sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact structure, with small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
