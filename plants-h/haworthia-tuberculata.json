    "intro": "Haworthia tuberculata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with white or yellow tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. Haworthia tuberculata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
