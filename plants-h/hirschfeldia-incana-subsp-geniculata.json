    "intro": "Hirschfeldia incana subsp. geniculata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and hairy, gray-green foliage that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to survive in harsh, desert environments."
