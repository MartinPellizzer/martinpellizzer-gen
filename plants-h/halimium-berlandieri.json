    "intro": "Halimium berlandieri, commonly known as the Mexican rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are small, leathery, and often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Halimium berlandieri is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and slopes."
