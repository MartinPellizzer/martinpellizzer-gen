    "intro": "Haplophyton cimicidum var. crooksii, commonly known as the Crook's liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its closely packed, leaf-like structures that form a dense, cushion-like growth. This variety is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices and forest floors. Its leaves are usually green or reddish in color and lack true roots, stems, or flowers. The plant's simple morphology and ability to retain moisture make it well-adapted to its specific ecological niche."
