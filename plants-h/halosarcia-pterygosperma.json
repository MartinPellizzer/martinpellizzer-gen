    "intro": "Halosarcia pterygosperma, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. The plant has a sprawling growth habit with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. Its seeds are enclosed in a fleshy, spiny capsule that aids in dispersal by animals. Halosarcia pterygosperma is adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to salt spray and drought."
