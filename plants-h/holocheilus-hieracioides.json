    "intro": "Holocheilus hieracioides, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant features small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring, often accompanied by trifoliate leaves. Its root system is fibrous and rhizomatous, allowing it to spread easily in suitable habitats. Holocheilus hieracioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments."
