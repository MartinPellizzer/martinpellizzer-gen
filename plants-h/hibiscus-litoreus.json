    "intro": "Hibiscus litoreus, commonly known as the coastal hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and wind. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are succulent and jointed. Hibiscus litoreus is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ornamental value and ability to stabilize dunes."
