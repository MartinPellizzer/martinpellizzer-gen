    "intro": "Hieracium truncellum, commonly known as the blunt-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive truncate or blunt tip, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Hieracium truncellum is often considered a weed but can be an important food source for certain pollinators."
