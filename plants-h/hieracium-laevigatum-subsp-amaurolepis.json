    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. amaurolepis, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, pale green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the typical H. laevigatum, particularly in leaf coloration and flower structure."
