    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum var. nanum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to northern regions of North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. This species is often found in moist, sandy soils along stream banks and in open woodlands."
