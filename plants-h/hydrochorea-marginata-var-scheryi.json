    "intro": "Hydrochorea marginata var. scheryi, commonly known as the Schery's waterweed, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water surface, with small, oval-shaped leaves arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and are often submerged or partially emergent. This variant is notable for its unique adaptations to aquatic life and is of interest to botanists studying wetland ecosystems."
