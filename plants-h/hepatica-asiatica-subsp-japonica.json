    "intro": "Hepatica asiatica subsp. japonica, commonly known as the Japanese hepatica, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features distinctive palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence. The plant produces showy, early spring flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, which bloom before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other early pollinators, making it an important species in forest ecosystems."
