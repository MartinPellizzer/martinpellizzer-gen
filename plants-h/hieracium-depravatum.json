    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius depravatum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette, and its flowers are yellow with a dark center. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native plants."
