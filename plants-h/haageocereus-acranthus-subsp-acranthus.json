    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus subsp. acranthus, commonly known as the desert rose or night bloomer cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces striking, large, white or pink flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to drought conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its lack of a central spines, giving it a more elegant appearance compared to other members of the genus."
