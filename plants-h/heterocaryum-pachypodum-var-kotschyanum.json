    "intro": "Heterocaryum pachypodum var. kotschyanum, commonly known as the Kotschyan's bottle tree, is a striking member of the Bignoniaceae family native to arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its thick, swollen trunk that stores water, a feature adapted to its harsh, dry environment. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its leaves are opposite and often deciduous, reducing water loss during droughts. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid landscapes."
