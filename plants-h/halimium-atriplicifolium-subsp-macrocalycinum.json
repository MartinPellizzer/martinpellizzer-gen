    "intro": "Halimium atriplicifolium subsp. macrocalycinum, commonly known as the large-fruited rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by distinctive, inflated fruits that split open to release seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species in Mediterranean flora."
