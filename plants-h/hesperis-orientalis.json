    "intro": "Hesperis orientalis, commonly known as the oriental honesty, is a flowering plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic four-petaled flowers. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are erect and branching. Hesperis orientalis is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance and ease of growth."
