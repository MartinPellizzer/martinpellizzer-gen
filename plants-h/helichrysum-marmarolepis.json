    "intro": "Helichrysum marmarolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain on the stems throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
