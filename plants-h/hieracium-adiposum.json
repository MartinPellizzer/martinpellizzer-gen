    "intro": "Hieracium adiposum, commonly known as the fat-hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
