    "intro": "Hieracium bodewigianum, commonly known as the Bodewig's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellowish to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium bodewigianum is often found in open habitats and can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
