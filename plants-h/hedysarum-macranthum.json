    "intro": "Hedysarum macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum macranthum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
