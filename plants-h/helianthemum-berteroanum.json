    "intro": "Helianthemum berteroanum, commonly known as the Canary Island sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal soils, thriving in full sun. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
