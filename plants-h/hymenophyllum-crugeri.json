    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crugeri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. Hymenophyllum crugeri is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it can access the moisture it requires for survival."
