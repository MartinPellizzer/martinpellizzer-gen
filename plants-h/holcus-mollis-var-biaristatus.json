    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. biaristatus, commonly known as the silver hair vetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, silver-gray foliage and clusters of small, pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinctive hairy texture that aids in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
