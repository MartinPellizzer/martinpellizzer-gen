    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. laeve, commonly known as the smooth meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in grassy meadows and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to brown ray florets. Its inflorescence is a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, and it produces achenes as its seed form. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stem and leaves, contributing to its identification in botanical studies."
