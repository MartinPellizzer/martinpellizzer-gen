    "intro": "Hieracium baeticum subsp. palomerae, commonly known as the Baetican hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. It is a relatively small plant, with leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Due to its restricted distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
