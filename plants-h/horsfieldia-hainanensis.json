    "intro": "Horsfieldia hainanensis, commonly known as the Hainan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of southern China, particularly Hainan Island. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, often with a distinctive red or purple lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
