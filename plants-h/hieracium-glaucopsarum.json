    "intro": "Hieracium glaucopsarum, commonly known as the bluish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The flowers are yellowish to reddish in color, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal."
