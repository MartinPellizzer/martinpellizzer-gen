    "intro": "Hicriopteris omeiensis, commonly known as the Omei holly fern, is a rare fern species native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan Province in China. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky outcrops or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hicriopteris omeiensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
