    "intro": "Hedysarum occidentale, commonly known as western vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum occidentale plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
