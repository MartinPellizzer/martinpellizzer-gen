    "intro": "Haworthia planifolia f. olivacea, commonly known as the Olive Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically a pale green to bluish-green color. The leaves are fleshy and have a smooth texture, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange, which appear on slender stalks during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
