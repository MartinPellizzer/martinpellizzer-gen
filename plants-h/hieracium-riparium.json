    "intro": "Hieracium riparium, commonly known as water thimbleweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along streams, rivers, and lakeshores. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense, dandelion-like cluster at the stem's tip. Hieracium riparium is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various insects and small vertebrates."
