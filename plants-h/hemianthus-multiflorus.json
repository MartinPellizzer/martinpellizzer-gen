    "intro": "Hemianthus multiflorus, commonly known as the African fan plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, carpet-like growth with narrow, ribbon-like leaves that form a lush, green undercarpet in freshwater habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display to its aquatic environment. It is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to oxygenate water. Hemianthus multiflorus prefers still or slow-moving waters with moderate to high light exposure for optimal growth."
