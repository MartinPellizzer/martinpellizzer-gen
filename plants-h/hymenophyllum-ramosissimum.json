    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ramosissimum, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum ramosissimum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouses or terrariums."
