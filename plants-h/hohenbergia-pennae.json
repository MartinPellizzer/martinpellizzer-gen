    "intro": "Hohenbergia pennae, commonly known as the pink-veined hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with pink or red hues. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright red bracts that enclose small, white flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia pennae is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
