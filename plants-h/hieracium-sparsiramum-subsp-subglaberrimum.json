    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiramum subsp. subglaberrimum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. The plant has basal leaves that are usually lanceolate or linear, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence, which gives it the subspecies name subglaberrimum."
