    "intro": "Hemionitis hintoniorum, commonly known as the Hinton's hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern found in specific wetland habitats. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and requires a consistently humid environment to survive. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological needs, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
