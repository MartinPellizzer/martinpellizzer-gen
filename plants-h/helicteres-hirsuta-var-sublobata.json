    "intro": "Helicteres hirsuta var. sublobata, commonly known as the hairy helicteres, is a variant of the helicteres hirsuta species native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft pubescence. The leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins and a distinct, slightly lobed base. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are arranged in panicles, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
