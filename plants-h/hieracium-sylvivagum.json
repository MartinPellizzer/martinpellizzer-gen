It typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, branching stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant has a fibrous root system.
