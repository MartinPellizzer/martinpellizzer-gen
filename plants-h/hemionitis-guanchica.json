    "intro": "Hemionitis guanchica, commonly known as the Canary Island fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis guanchica is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
