    "intro": "Haworthia tretyrensis var. pectinis, commonly known as the Zulu beauty, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, light green to blue-gray leaves with distinct white or pale markings. The leaves are typically short and triangular, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
