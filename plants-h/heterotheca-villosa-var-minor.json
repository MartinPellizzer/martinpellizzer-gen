    "intro": "Heterotheca villosa var. minor, commonly known as the hairy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
