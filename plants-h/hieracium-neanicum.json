    "intro": "Hieracium neanicum, commonly known as the Nean's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. The plant features basal rosettes of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It has small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Hieracium neanicum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is considered a characteristic species of disturbed soils."
