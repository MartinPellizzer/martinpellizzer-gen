    "intro": "Haageocereus lanugispinus, commonly known as the woolly cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, woolly covering of pale blue or white bristles, which provide insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as a solitary stem with a short, thick trunk and sparse, sparsely distributed spines. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, appearing during the warmer months. This cactus is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, thriving in well-drained soils."
