    "intro": "Hydrocleys uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay water plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick, spongy stem that helps it remain buoyant. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically emerging from the water, and it produces berries that contain its seeds. Hydrocleys uruguayensis is often found in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and wetlands."
