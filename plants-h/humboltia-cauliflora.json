    "intro": "Humboltia cauliflora, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in shades of violet or blue. The plant typically grows along rocky shores and sandy beaches, where it thrives in saline and well-drained soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Humboltia cauliflora is a member of the Convolvulaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed coastal areas."
