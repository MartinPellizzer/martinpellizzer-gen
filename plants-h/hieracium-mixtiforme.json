    "intro": "Hieracium mixtiforme, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
