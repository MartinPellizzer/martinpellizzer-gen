    "intro": "Hieracium boreale subsp. obliquum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered with fine hairs, and the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
