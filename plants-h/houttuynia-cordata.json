    "intro": "Houttuynia cordata, commonly known as the Indian nettle or snake plant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red or yellow at the edges. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or greenish-yellow, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often used in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value and air-purifying qualities make it a popular houseplant."
