    "intro": "Hieracium nastum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. This plant is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in many regions."
