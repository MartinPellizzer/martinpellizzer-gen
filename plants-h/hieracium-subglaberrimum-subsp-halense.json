    "intro": "Hieracium subglaberrimum subsp. halense, commonly known as the Halense Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and it produces yellow flowers in dense clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like inflorescences and is often found in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
