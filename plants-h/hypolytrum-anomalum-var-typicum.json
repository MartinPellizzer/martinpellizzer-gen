    "intro": "Hypolytrum anomalum var. typicum, commonly known as the slender false orchid, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in spikes, often resembling those of true orchids. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
