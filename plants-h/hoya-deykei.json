    "intro": "Hoya deykei, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya deykei is a trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
