    "intro": "Hortonia floribunda var. ovalifolia, commonly known as the oval-leaf flowering orchid, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a striking visual contrast to its delicate, clustered flowers. The plant produces fragrant, orchid-like blooms in shades of white and pale pink during the spring and summer months. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hortonia floribunda var. ovalifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
