    "intro": "Hemiphlebium peltatum, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a subtle golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and prefers partial shade, often growing in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Hemiphlebium peltatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservatories."
