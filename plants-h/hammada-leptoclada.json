    "intro": "Hammada leptoclada, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and small, gray-green leaves that reduce water loss through transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Hammada leptoclada is well adapted to harsh desert environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
