    "intro": "Hymenophyllum campanulatum, commonly known as the bell-shaped fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia. It features delicate, wiry fronds with a distinctive bell-shaped spore case, or sorus, on the underside of its leaves. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically light green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
