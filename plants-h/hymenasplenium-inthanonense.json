    "intro": "Hymenasplenium inthanonense, commonly known as the Ithanon spleenwort, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and dark green, glossy leaves that are often curved at the tips. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporophytes, are relatively small and develop from the leaf axils. Hymenasplenium inthanonense is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing rocky habitats and contributing to soil formation in humid environments."
