It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or sandy landscapes.
