    "intro": "Heracleum simplicifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to North America. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often reddish-purple in color and covered with fine hairs. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences. Its fruits are small, dry, and ribbed, containing a single seed. Cow parsnip is often found in moist meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas."
