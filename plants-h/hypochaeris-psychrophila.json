    "intro": "Hypochaeris psychrophila, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its small, yellow, daisy-like flowers and hairy, compact growth habit, which helps it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to low temperatures and strong winds. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is known for its resilience in alpine ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
