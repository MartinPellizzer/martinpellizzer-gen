It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, which give it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is characterized by its distinctive, hairy fruits that mature into small, dry capsules."
