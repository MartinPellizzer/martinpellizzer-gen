    "intro": "Hieracium aphanadenum, commonly known as the ghost dandelion, is a rare and elusive species of flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its small, inconspicuous yellow flowers and hairy, basal leaves that are often hidden among the vegetation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its scientific name reflects its elusive nature, with \"aphanadenum\" meaning \"invisible flower.\" Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
