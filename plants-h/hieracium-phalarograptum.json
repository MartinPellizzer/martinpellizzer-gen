    "intro": "Hieracium phalarograptum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
