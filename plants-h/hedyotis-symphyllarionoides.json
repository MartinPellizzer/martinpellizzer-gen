It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
