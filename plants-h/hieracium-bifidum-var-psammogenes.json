    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum var. psammogenes, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to sandy coastal areas of Europe. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as dunes and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant has a low, spreading growth habit with numerous flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. This variety is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and supporting pollinator populations."
