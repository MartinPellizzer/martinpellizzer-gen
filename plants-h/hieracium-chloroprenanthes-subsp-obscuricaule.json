    "intro": "Hieracium chloroprenanthes subsp. obscuricaule, commonly known as the dark-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
