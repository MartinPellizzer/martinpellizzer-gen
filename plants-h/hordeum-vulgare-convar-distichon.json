    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare convar. distichon, commonly known as two-row barley, is a member of the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its two-row arrangement of grains on the spikelets, distinguishing it from other barley varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has slender, hollow stems covered in fine hairs. Its leaves are elongated and parallel-veined, with a bluish-green color. The inflorescence is a panicle, consisting of spikelets that bear the small, wind-pollinated flowers."
