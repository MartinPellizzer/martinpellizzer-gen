It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
