    "intro": "Hypoxis elata, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. Its tuberous root system allows it to store nutrients and moisture, enabling survival during dry periods. Hypoxis elata is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun."
