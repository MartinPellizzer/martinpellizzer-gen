    "intro": "Hieracium echioides subsp. malacotrichum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain areas."
