    "intro": "Hymenophyllum apiculatum, commonly known as the rosette fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has a distinctive rosette-shaped growth pattern with closely packed, lanceolate leaves. The fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss in its humid habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
