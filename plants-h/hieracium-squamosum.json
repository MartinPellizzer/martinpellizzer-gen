    "intro": "Hieracium squamosum, commonly known as the scaly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, gray-green leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. Its foliage and flowers are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
