    "intro": "Helichrysum notatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even after drying, making it popular in floral arrangements. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Helichrysum notatum is also valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
