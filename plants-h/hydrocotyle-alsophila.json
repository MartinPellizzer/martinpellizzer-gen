    "intro": "Hydrocotyle alsophila, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Araliaceae family. Hydrocotyle alsophila plays a role in stabilizing water ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
