    "intro": "Hiraea maritima, commonly known as sea hiraea, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shore. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly succulent, adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Hiraea maritima plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
