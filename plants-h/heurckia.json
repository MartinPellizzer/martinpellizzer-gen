    "intro": "Heurckia, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Argentina and Chile, and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Heurckia species often have hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
