    "intro": "Haageocereus cephalomacrostibas, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white and yellow. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant is adapted to full sun exposure and requires well-draining soil to thrive."
