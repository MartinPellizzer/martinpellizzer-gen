    "intro": "Hieracium urnigerum, commonly known as the urn weed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive urn-shaped structure, and it produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium urnigerum is often considered a weed but has ecological value by supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil."
