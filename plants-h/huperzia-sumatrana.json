    "intro": "Huperzia sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Huperzia sumatrana typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its spores are released from sporangia that are clustered on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
