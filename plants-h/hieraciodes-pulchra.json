It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention.
