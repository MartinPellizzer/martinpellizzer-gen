    "intro": "Hippuris palustris, commonly known as the marsh horsetail, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, jointed stems and small, scale-like leaves that are adapted for underwater growth. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes, ponds, and stream edges. Due to its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, it plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
