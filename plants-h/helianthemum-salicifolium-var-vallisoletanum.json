    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. vallisoletanum, commonly known as the Vallisoletan rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
