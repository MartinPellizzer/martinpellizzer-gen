    "intro": "Habenaria hieronymi var. saltensis, commonly known as the Saltensis Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires moderate to high light exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
