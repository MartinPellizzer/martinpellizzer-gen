    "intro": "Haloragis palauensis, commonly known as the Palau water starwort, is a flowering plant native to the island nation of Palau in the western Pacific Ocean. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family, which includes aquatic and semi-aquatic species. The plant typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and wetlands. It has small, star-shaped leaves and produces tiny, greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
