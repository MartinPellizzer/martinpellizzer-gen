    "intro": "Hibiscus barbadensis f. fruticulosus, commonly known as the fruticose hibiscus, is a compact, shrub-like form of the common hibiscus. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. It produces fibrous, woody stems that give it a bushy appearance, distinguishing it from the more vine-like varieties of hibiscus. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
