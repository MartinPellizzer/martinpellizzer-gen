    "intro": "Hoya flagellata, commonly known as the weeping hoya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are thick, glossy, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
