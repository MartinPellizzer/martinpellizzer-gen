    "intro": "Helianthemum piliferum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sunflower or alpine rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh, high-altitude environment. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine displays."
