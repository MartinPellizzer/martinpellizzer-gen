    "intro": "Halimium alyssoides var. rugosum, commonly known as the rough-hairy sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces clusters of pinkish-white, bell-shaped flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural conditions."
