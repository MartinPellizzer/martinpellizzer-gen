    "intro": "Helichrysum adnatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small, fluffy balls, which are highly ornamental. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs. Helichrysum adnatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
