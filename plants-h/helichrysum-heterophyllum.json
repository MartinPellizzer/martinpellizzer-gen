    "intro": "Helichrysum heterophyllum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and a compact, bushy growth habit. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are long-lasting when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
