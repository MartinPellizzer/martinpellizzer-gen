    "intro": "Hieracium illyricum subsp. baldensiforme, commonly known as the Illyrian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and stature."
