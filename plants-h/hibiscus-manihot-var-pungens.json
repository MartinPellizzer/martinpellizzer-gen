    "intro": "Hibiscus manihot var. pungens, commonly known as the thorned hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant produces a sticky, milky sap that can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its hairy stems and thorn-like structures on the leaves distinguish it from other hibiscus species."
