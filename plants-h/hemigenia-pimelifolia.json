    "intro": "Hemigenia pimelifolia, commonly known as the lemon myrtle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Myrtaceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, lemon-scented leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are often used in cooking and traditional medicine due to their high content of citral, a compound responsible for its distinctive fragrance. Hemigenia pimelifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is typically found in rainforest or wetland habitats."
