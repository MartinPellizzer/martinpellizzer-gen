    "intro": "Heliotropium parvulum, commonly known as little heliotrope, is a small, flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant produces small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Heliotropium parvulum is often found in coastal areas and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
