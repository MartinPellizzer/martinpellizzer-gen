    "intro": "Heliophila hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant features slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Heliophila hirsuta is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with roots that help stabilize the soil in wetland habitats."
