    "intro": "Hymenophyllum latilobum, commonly known as the broad-lobed spore moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for reproduction. This species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
