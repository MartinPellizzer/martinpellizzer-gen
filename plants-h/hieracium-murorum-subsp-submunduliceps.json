    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. submunduliceps, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats. Its botanical significance lies in its adaptation to harsh mountain environments and its role in alpine ecosystems."
