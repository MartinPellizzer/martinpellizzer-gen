    "intro": "Helianthemum brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed sunflower of the rock rose family, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
