    "intro": "Heliotropium elachanthum, commonly known as the slender heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with slender stems and narrow leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. The genus Heliotropium is known for its heliotropic tendencies, though this species exhibits less pronounced sun-tracking behavior compared to others in the group."
