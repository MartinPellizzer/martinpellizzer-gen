    "intro": "Henrya reticulata, commonly known as the silver leaf henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its striking silvery-white foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during the spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a compact, decorative plant."
