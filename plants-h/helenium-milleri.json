    "intro": "Helenium milleri, commonly known as the Mexican sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, cone-shaped flower heads. The plant produces bright orange to red ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helenium milleri typically grows in open, sunny habitats, including prairies and woodland edges. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
