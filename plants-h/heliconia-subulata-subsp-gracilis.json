    "intro": "Heliconia subulata subsp. gracilis, commonly known as the slender spike heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its long, narrow, leaf-like bracts that enclose its showy, red-orange inflorescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its striking appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates."
