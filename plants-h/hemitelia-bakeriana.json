    "intro": "Hemitelia bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's hemitelia, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are usually elliptical with a smooth texture, and it produces small, fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemitelia bakeriana is considered a species of conservation concern."
