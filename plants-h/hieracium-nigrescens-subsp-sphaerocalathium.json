It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and flowering heads. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically clustered in a spherical shape, giving it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
