    "intro": "Heptaptera, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which results from a dense covering of fine hairs on the leaves. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. Heptaptera species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and are often found in dry, open woodlands. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
