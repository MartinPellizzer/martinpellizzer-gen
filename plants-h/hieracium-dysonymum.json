    "intro": "Hieracium dysonymum, commonly known as the Dyson's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium dysonymum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
