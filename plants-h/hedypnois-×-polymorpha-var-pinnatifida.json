    "intro": "Hedypnois \u00d7 polymorpha var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hedypnois, is a hybrid plant species characterized by its delicate, fern-like foliage. It typically features elongated, pinnately divided leaves that give it a lacy appearance. The plant is often found in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its botanical structure includes a rhizomatous root system and small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish in color. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
