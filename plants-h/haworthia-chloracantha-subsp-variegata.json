It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings, giving it a striking, variegated appearance. The leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, white or green flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or indoor cultivation due to its resilience and ornamental appeal."
