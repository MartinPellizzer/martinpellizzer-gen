    "intro": "Habzelia aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian habzelia, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Ethiopia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are simple, alternate, and often covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
