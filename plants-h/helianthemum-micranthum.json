    "intro": "Helianthemum micranthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a bright touch to its compact foliage. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum micranthum is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging environments."
