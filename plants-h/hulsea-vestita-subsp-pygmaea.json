    "intro": "Hulsea vestita subsp. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hulsea, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers during the summer months, which are borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky stream banks. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the cool, humid climates of its native habitat."
