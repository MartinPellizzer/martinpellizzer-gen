    "intro": "Hieracium symmetricum, commonly known as the symmetrical hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
