    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. veprinacense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its erect stems and is often found in meadows and open slopes at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
