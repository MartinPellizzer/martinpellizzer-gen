    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina var. intermedia, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cold, dry conditions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its resilience and ability to colonize harsh environments, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and supporting alpine ecosystems."
