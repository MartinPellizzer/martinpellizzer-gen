    "intro": "Habranthus salinarum, commonly known as the salt marsh bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Habranthus salinarum plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
