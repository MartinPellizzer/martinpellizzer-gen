    "intro": "Heliophila sulcata, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. The plant features slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its small, white or pale blue flowers are arranged in spikes. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive spongy texture that aids in buoyancy. Heliophila sulcata plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for insects and other small organisms."
