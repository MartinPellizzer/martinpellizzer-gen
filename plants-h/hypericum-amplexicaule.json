It features prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite and oval, with a slightly waxy texture. Hypericum amplexicaule is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
