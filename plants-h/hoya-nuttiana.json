    "intro": "Hoya nuttiana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Hoya nuttiana thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ornamental beauty."
