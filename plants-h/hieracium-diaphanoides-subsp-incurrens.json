    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. incurrens, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is known for its translucent, waxy coating on the leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges."
