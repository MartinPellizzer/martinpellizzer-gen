    "intro": "Heterosamara, commonly known as the \"buttercup tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that resemble those of the buttercup, though they are not related. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, alternate leaves that are often glossy. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and it is native to various regions in Africa and Asia. Heterosamara species are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral display."
