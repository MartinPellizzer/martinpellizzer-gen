    "intro": "Hakea scabrida, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that bloom in winter, typically in shades of yellow to orange. Hakea scabrida is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
