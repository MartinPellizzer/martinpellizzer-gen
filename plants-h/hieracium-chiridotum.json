    "intro": "Hieracium chiridotum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and has basal leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer and are followed by small, dry fruits called achenes. Hieracium chiridotum is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
