    "intro": "Hypoestes triflora var. triflora, commonly known as the \"Magic Flower\" or \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a strikingly colorful shrub native to Madagascar. It features showy, triangular bracts in shades of red, orange, and yellow, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, contrasting with its vibrant bracts. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in indoor environments."
