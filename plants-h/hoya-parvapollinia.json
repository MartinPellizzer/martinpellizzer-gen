    "intro": "Hoya parvapollinia, commonly known as the small-pollen hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Hoya parvapollinia is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
