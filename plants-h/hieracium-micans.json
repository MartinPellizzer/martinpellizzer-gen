It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves and can grow up to 30 centimeters tall. Its flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster, making it easily identifiable in the wild."
