    "intro": "Haplopappus fremontii subsp. wardii, commonly known as Ward's hairyfruit, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are narrowly linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. The fruit is a small, persistent achene with a pappus, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds."
