    "intro": "Heuchera alba, commonly known as white alumroot, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are borne on slender, leafless stems. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a popular ornamental plant. Heuchera alba thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, often found in woodland settings."
