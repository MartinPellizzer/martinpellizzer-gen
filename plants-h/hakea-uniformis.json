    "intro": "Hakea uniformis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems and compact growth habit make it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. Hakea uniformis is often used in native landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
