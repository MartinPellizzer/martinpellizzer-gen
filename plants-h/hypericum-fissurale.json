    "intro": "Hypericum fissurale, commonly known as the fissured St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
