    "intro": "Habenaria caffra, commonly known as the African marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and forest understories. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale green to white flowers. Its roots are often symbiotic with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The orchid's structure and growth habits reflect its adaptation to humid, nutrient-poor habitats."
