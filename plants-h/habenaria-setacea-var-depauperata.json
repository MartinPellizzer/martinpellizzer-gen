It features slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
