    "intro": "Hydroglossum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceolate water-lily, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still water bodies such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has broad, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and bloom during the summer months. Hydroglossum lanceolatum plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic insects and small fish."
