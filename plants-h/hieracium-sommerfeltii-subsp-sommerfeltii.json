    "intro": "Hieracium sommerfeltii subsp. sommerfeltii, commonly known as the Sommerfelt's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are smaller and more linear. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
