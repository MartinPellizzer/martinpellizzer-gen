    "intro": "Hieracium ampyificatum, commonly known as the Showy Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by pale green leaves with a rough texture. Hieracium ampyificatum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread quickly."
