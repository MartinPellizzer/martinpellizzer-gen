    "intro": "Heliotropium tenuifolium var. parviflorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of purple or pink. The leaves are linear and narrow, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
