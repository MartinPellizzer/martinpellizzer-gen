    "intro": "Hibiscus latifolius, commonly known as the narrowleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hibiscus latifolius is a herbaceous perennial that produces seeds in fibrous pods, which are dispersed by water. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and wetland restoration projects."
