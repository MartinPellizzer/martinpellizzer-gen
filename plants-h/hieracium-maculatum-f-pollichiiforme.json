    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum f. pollichiiforme, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with wavy margins and are covered in fine hairs. This variant is distinguished by its larger, more prominently shaped leaves compared to the typical form of H. maculatum."
