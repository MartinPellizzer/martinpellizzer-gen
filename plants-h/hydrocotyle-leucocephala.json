    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala, commonly known as white-veined water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are divided into lobes, with a white-veined pattern on the underside. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom from summer to fall. Hydrocotyle leucocephala plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
