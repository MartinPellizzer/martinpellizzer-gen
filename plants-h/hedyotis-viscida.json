    "intro": "Hedyotis viscida, commonly known as the sticky hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a low-growing herb with slender, often hairy stems that produce small, white or greenish flowers. The plant's leaves are typically opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated edge. Hedyotis viscida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its sticky secretions on the stems and leaves may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
