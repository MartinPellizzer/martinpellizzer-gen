It is characterized by its dense, fluffy clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble small, dried flowers, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, slightly resinous scent. This species is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
