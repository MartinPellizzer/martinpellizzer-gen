    "intro": "Helianthemum canum subsp. canum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fleshy, glandular leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in spring, which are borne on short pedicels and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy and versatile plant for Mediterranean climates."
