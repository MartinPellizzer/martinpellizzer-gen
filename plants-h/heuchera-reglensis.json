    "intro": "Heuchera reglensis, commonly known as the Appalachian alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, often variegated leaves that display a range of colors including red, purple, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera reglensis is also valued for its ornamental foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
