    "intro": "Hieracium vagifrons, commonly known as the wandering hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium vagifrons is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
