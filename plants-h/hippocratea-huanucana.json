    "intro": "Hippocratea huanucana, commonly known as the Huanuco orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces pale yellow to greenish-white blooms with intricate patterns on the petals and sepals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments at high altitudes, often growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
