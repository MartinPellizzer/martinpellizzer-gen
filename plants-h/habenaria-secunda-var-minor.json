    "intro": "Habenaria secunda var. minor, commonly known as the small flame orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features a slender, upright stem with a few leaves and produces delicate, showy flowers with a distinctive red and yellow coloration. The plant typically blooms in late summer or early autumn, and its flowers have a unique, spurred lip that aids in pollination. It prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
