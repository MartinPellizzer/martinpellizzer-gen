    "intro": "Helenium, commonly known as the sneezeweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and vibrant, often orange or red, ray flowers that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is native to North America. Helenium species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens due to their striking appearance and ability to attract pollinators. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to the plant's unique botanical profile."
