    "intro": "Hierochloe wendelboi, commonly known as Wendelbo's bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine habitats. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered with fine hairs, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
