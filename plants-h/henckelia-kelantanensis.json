    "intro": "Henckelia kelantanensis, commonly known as the Kelantan heath. It is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland heathlands. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
