    "intro": "Hibiscus quinquelobus, commonly known as the five-lobed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with five distinct lobes. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hibiscus quinquelobus is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
