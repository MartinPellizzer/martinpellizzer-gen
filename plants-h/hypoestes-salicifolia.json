    "intro": "Hypoestes salicifolia, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, velvety, silver-white leaves that are often adorned with red or purple veins. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
