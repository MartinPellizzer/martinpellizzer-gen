    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. trachypus, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are typically yellow with ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
