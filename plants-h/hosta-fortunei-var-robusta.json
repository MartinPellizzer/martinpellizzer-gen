    "intro": "Hosta fortunei var. robusta, commonly known as the giant blue hosta, is a popular ornamental plant prized for its large, waxy leaves. This variety features broad, strap-like leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a deep blue-green coloration. The foliage is typically variegated with white or yellow margins, adding visual interest to the plant. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-draining soil. While it does not produce showy flowers, its striking foliage makes it a standout in shady garden settings."
