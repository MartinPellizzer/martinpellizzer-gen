It is a low-growing perennial herb with small, clustered leaves that are rough to the touch. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by small, bristly seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
