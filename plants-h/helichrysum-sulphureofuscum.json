    "intro": "Helichrysum sulphureofuscum, commonly known as the golden-yellow everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and bright yellow to golden-orange flowers that retain their color even when dried. The plant produces small, tubular florets surrounded by overlapping, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for both its aesthetic appeal and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
