    "intro": "Hieracium psilacrum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and small, yellowish-green flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Hieracium psilacrum is often found in temperate regions of Europe and is considered a minor weed in agricultural settings."
