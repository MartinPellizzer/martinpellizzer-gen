It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Native to Australia, this plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Its unique morphology and adaptation to harsh environments make it a notable species in ecological studies. The plant's ability to store water in its succulent stems helps it survive in drought conditions."
