    "intro": "Hedysarum atomarium, commonly known as the dwarf sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Hedysarum atomarium is also cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its delicate appearance and hardiness."
