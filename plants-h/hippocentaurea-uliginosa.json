    "intro": "Hippocentaurea uliginosa, commonly known as the bog centaury, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, blue or purple flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of healthy wetland ecosystems."
