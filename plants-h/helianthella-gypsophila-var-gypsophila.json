    "intro": "Helianthella gypsophila var. gypsophila, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as gravelly soils and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. The species is adapted to withstand drought and has a deep root system to access underground moisture."
