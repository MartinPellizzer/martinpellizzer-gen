    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. epimediiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in temperate climates. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
