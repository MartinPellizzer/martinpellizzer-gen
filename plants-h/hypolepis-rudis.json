    "intro": "Hypolepis rudis, commonly known as the rough shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy scales. The fronds are typically upright and can grow up to several feet in length, making it a striking addition to moist, shaded environments. The plant thrives in humid conditions and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
