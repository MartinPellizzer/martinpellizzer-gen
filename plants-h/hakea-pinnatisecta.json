    "intro": "Hakea pinnatisecta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often arranged in a pinnatisect pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. Hakea pinnatisecta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
