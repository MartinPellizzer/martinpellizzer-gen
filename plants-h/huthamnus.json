    "intro": "Huthamnus, commonly known as the mountain huthamnus, is a rare and lesser-known plant species found in specific alpine regions. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by round, green fruits that mature to a deep red. Huthamnus is adapted to cold climates and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
