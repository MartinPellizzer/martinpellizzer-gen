    "intro": "Hieracium adenodermum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils. Hieracium adenodermum typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its fibrous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
