It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in early summer and attract various pollinators. Hippocrepis flexuosa is often found in disturbed or open areas and is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect life."
