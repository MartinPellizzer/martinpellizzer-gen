    "intro": "Hymenophyllum marginatum, commonly known as the marginal hound's-tongue, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often tinged with silver or pale green, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length, and the plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Hymenophyllum marginatum is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks, where it can absorb moisture from the air."
