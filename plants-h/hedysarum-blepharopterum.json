    "intro": "Hedysarum blepharopterum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Hedysarum blepharopterum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
