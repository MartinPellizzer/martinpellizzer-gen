It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hieracium sellandii is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes."
