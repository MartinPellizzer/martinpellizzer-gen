    "intro": "Hieracium cirritum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts that resemble leaves, and it produces seeds in a fluffy pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium cirritum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
