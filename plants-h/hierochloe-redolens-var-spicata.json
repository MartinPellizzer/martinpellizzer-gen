    "intro": "Hierochloe redolens var. spicata, commonly known as the fragrant hairgrass, is a flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that are often clustered in dense spikes along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its fragrant scent, particularly noticeable when crushed, is a distinctive botanical feature."
