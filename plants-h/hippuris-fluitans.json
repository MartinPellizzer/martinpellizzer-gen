    "intro": "Hippuris fluitans, commonly known as water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It has broad, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its roots are anchored in the substrate, and it plays a role in stabilizing water bodies by reducing erosion. Hippuris fluitans is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds and marshes."
