    "intro": "Hemerocallis sieboldii, commonly known as the Japanese daylily, is a perennial flowering plant native to Japan. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has sword-like, grassy foliage that remains evergreen in mild climates. It is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. The flowers are short-lived, lasting only one day, which is characteristic of the Hemerocallis genus."
