    "intro": "Hymenophyllum contiguum, commonly known as the clustered filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters, which is a distinguishing feature of the genus Hymenophyllum. This species is widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, shaded habitats."
