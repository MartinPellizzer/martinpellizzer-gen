    "intro": "Hieracium aletschense, commonly known as the Aletsch hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and mountainous habitats, thriving in cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
