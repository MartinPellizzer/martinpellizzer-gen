It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique floral structure and striking coloration. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. It has a sympodial growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
