    "intro": "Heterochroa minuartioides, commonly known as the dwarf rock orchid, is a small, perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. The plant features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, spurred orchid flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a labellum with intricate patterns and a column that is distinct from other orchid genera. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
