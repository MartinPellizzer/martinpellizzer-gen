    "intro": "Haplophyllum villosum subsp. ciscaucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian hairy saxifrage, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas with cool, moist climates. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are small and white or pink, arranged in a dense cluster at the top of the stem. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
