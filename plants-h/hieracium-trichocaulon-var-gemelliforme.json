    "intro": "Hieracium trichocaulon var. gemelliforme, commonly known as the twin-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. This variant is distinguished by its paired leaves, giving it the \"twin-leaf\" characteristic in its name."
