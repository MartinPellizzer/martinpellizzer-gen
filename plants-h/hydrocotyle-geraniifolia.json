    "intro": "Hydrocotyle geraniifolia, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often floating or just above the water. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Hydrocotyle geraniifolia plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
