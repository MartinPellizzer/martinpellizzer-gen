    "intro": "Heterolaena decussata, commonly known as the cross-leaved grass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive cross-shaped leaf bases, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, sunny environments such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a loose panicle, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Heterolaena decussata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
