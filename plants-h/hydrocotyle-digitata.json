    "intro": "Hydrocotyle digitata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and stream margins. The plant has finely divided, floating or submerged leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and borne in clusters, often emerging from the water surface. Hydrocotyle digitata plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
