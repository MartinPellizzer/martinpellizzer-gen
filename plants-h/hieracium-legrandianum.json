    "intro": "Hieracium legrandianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium legrandianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits and ability to spread rapidly."
