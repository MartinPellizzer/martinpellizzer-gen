    "intro": "Habenaria aestivalis, commonly known as the summer orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. The plant features a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers that are usually pale pink or white with a greenish throat. Its leaves are linear and often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base of the stem. The orchid has a complex root system and relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, which is a common trait among orchids."
