It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and sand dunes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
