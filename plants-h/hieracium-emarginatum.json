    "intro": "Hieracium emarginatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and sometimes branched. Hieracium emarginatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
