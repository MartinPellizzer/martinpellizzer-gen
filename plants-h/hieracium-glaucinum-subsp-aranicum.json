It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. It is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
