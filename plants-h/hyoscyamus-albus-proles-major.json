It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its hairy stems and large, showy white or pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its toxicity, it is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
