    "intro": "Halocnemum, commonly known as sea-spurrey, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, salt-tolerant leaves and small, white or pink flowers. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. Halocnemum species are often used in phytoremediation due to their ability to accumulate heavy metals. They play an important role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal regions."
