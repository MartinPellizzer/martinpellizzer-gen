    "intro": "Hydrocleys standleyi, commonly known as the water zinnia, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are oval and slightly pointed, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom throughout the growing season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Hydrocleys standleyi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
