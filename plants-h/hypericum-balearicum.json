It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas due to its drought tolerance. Its medicinal properties have been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
