    "intro": "Hiraea nitens, commonly known as the slender hiraea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of South America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces small, dry fruits that contain several seeds. Hiraea nitens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
