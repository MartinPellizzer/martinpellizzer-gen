    "intro": "Hieracium sublongifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are elongated and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium sublongifolium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
