    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodenigrans, commonly known as the false black hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellowish-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadside areas. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
