    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found in coastal or inland scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
