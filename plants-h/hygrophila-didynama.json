    "intro": "Hygrophila didynama, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. It produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are usually blue or purple in color. Hygrophila didynama is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in water purification and habitat creation for aquatic life."
