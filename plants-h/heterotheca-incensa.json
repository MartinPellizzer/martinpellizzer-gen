It is characterized by its striking yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces a distinctive conical flower head with yellow ray florets and brown disk florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Heterotheca incensa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes."
