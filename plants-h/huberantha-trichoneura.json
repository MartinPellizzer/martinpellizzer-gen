It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces striking, orchid-like flowers with a unique trichoneura pattern on the petals. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
