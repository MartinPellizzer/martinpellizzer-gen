    "intro": "Heterelytron, commonly known as the false blister beetle, is a genus of beetles belonging to the family Meloidae. These insects are characterized by their elongated, often brightly colored bodies and the presence of a false blister, which is a hardened, shield-like structure on the dorsal side. The larvae, known as triungulate larvae, are typically parasitic and develop inside the bodies of host insects. The adults are often found in moist environments, such as near streams or in damp woodlands. Heterelytron species play a role in ecological systems through their interactions with host species and their contribution to nutrient cycling."
