    "intro": "Hemionitis galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos hemionitis, is a rare fern endemic to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal areas and volcanic rock crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
