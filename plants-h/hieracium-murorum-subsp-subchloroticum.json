    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subchloroticum, commonly known as the pale-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale greenish-yellow leaves, which are smaller and more densely covered with hairs compared to the typical form. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. This plant is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
