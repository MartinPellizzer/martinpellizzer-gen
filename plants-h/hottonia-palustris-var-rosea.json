It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with a rosy-pink hue that adds a vibrant touch to its habitat. The plant produces small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a subtle rose tint. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in regions with temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and pond landscapes."
