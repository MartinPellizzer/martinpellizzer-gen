    "intro": "Hieracium furculaticeps, commonly known as the forked-headed hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often branched inflorescence that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head. Hieracium furculaticeps is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
