    "intro": "Huperzia serrata var. dentata, commonly known as the serrate huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila on the underside of its leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is noted for its slow growth and is often found in temperate regions across Asia and North America."
