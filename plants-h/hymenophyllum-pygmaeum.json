    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like fronds and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. This species thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Hymenophyllum pygmaeum is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil."
