    "intro": "Hedysarum altaicum, commonly known as the high mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum altaicum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it an important plant in soil enrichment."
