    "intro": "Horridocactus kunzei, commonly known as the devil's backbone, is a unique cactus native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems that can grow up to 10 feet in height, making it one of the tallest cacti in the world. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking contrast to its rugged appearance. Its thick, fleshy stems are adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. Horridocactus kunzei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience."
