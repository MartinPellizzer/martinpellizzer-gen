    "intro": "Hedyotis macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved dotweed, is a perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne in the axils of the leaves. Its flowers are followed by small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Hedyotis macrophylla is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
