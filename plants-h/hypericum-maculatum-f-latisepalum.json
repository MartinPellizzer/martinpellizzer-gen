    "intro": "Hypericum maculatum f. latisepalum, commonly known as the broad-sepal yellow garden hypericum, is a cultivated form of the creeping St. John's wort. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy sepals that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with orange-red centers, typical of the Hypericum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often used in ornamental gardening. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense ground cover."
