    "intro": "Hieracium floccivelatum, commonly known as the fluffhead hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a fluffy pappus that aids in seed dispersal. Hieracium floccivelatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
