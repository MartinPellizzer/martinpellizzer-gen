    "intro": "Helianthemum jacquinii, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, typically blooming in spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Helianthemum jacquinii is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
