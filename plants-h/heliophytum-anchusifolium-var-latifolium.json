    "intro": "Heliophytum anchusifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved heliophyte, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically broad and oval in shape, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a desirable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
