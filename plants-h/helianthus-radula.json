    "intro": "Helianthus radula, commonly known as the slender sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry climates. Helianthus radula is often found in rocky soils and is known for its ability to bloom late in the growing season."
