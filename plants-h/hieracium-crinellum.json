    "intro": "Hieracium crinellum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium crinellum is often considered a weed but can play a role in supporting local pollinators."
