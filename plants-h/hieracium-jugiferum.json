It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant has hairy stems and leaves.
