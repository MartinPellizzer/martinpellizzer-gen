It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine regions. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
