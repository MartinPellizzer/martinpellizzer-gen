    "intro": "Hubbardochloa, commonly known as the panhandle grass, is a genus of grasses native to the United States, particularly in the southern and western regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hubbardochloa species are often used in landscaping for their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They play a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in native habitats."
