It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and grasslands. Its rhizome-based root system allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
