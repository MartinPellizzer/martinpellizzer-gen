    "intro": "Hakea trinervis, commonly known as the three-veined hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are arranged in three vertical rows along the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. Hakea trinervis is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its striking floral display."
