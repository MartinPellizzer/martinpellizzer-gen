    "intro": "Hyoscyamus arenarius, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces showy, yellow or greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually palmately lobed and covered with fine hairs, and the fruit is a spiny, spherical capsule. Hyoscyamus arenarius contains toxic alkaloids and has been used historically in traditional medicine, though its use is now largely restricted due to its potent effects."
