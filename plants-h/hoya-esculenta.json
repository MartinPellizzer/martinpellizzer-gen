    "intro": "Hoya esculenta, commonly known as the wax plant or wax vine, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval to heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya esculenta is a climbing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
