    "intro": "Heterocaryum echinophorum var. minimum, commonly known as the dwarf echinophore, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of salt marshes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
