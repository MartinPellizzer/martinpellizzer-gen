    "intro": "Hakea fastigiata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped red or yellow flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Hakea fastigiata is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract native wildlife."
