    "intro": "Heterotheca villosa var. hispida, commonly known as the hispid blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its flowers are yellow with white rays, blooming in late summer to early fall. The hairy stems and leaves of this variety help reduce water loss, adapting it to arid environments."
