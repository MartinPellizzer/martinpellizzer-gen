It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often clustered at the base of the plant. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Huperzia unguiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
