It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium neolygodes is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds."
