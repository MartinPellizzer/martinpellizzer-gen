    "intro": "Hymenocallis littoralis var. dryanderi, commonly known as the coastal spider lily, is a variant of the spider lily native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and striking, funnel-shaped white flowers with a yellow throat. The plant typically grows in sandy or well-drained soils along the coast, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its bulbs are adapted to withstand salt spray and periodic flooding, making it well-suited to maritime environments. This variety is valued for its ornamental beauty and resilience in coastal gardens."
