    "intro": "Helichrysum viscidissimum var. volkii, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage covered in fine, sticky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a popular choice among gardeners in arid regions."
