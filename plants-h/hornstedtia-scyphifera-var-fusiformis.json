    "intro": "Hornstedtia scyphifera var. fusiformis, commonly known as the fusiform horned dandelion, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by fluffy white seed heads. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
