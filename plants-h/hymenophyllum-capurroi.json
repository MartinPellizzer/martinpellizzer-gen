    "intro": "Hymenophyllum capurroi, commonly known as the Capurro's spore moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rock surfaces or decaying wood. The plant has a dense, carpet-like growth habit with closely packed, leaf-like structures called thallus. Its reproductive structures, known as sorocarps, are borne on stalks and contain spores for dispersal. Hymenophyllum capurroi is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
