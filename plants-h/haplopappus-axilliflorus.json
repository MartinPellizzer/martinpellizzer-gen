    "intro": "Haplopappus axilliflorus, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions. Its small, showy yellow flowers bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Haplopappus axilliflorus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes due to its low water requirements."
