    "intro": "Heliamphora nutans, commonly known as the drooping sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its unique pitcher-shaped leaves that trap and digest insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy interior that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil. Heliamphora nutans is valued for its striking appearance and ecological role in its native habitat."
