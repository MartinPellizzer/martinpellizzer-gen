    "intro": "Haworthia cuspidata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are covered in a layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
