    "intro": "Hakea saxatilis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy or rocky soils make it well-suited to coastal and semi-arid habitats. Hakea saxatilis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
