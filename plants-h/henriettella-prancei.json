    "intro": "Henriettella prancei, commonly known as the Prance's henriettella, is a rare and enigmatic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants such as buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its delicate, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. Henriettella prancei is known for its inconspicuous flowers, which are usually greenish or reddish in color and bloom during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
