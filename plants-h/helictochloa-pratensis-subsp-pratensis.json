    "intro": "Helictochloa pratensis subsp. pratensis, commonly known as the meadow grass or slender meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, tufted stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the top of each stem, bearing small, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
