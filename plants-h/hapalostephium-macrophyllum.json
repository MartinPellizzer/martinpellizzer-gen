    "intro": "Hapalostephium macrophyllum, commonly known as the giant feather grass, is a striking ornamental grass native to southern Africa. It features tall, arching inflorescences that resemble plumes, with long, narrow leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping and drought-tolerant gardens. Its feathery appearance adds a dramatic visual element to landscapes, particularly in coastal or Mediterranean climates. Botanically, it is characterized by its robust rhizomes and showy, silver-green flower spikes that bloom in late summer."
