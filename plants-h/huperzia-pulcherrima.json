    "intro": "Huperzia pulcherrima, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a species of clubmoss native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Huperzia pulcherrima is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems."
