It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. This subspecies is native to the Balkan Peninsula and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, which helps it colonize disturbed soils. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
