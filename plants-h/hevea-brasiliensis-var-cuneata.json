It is characterized by its large, elongated leaves and produces latex, which is harvested for natural rubber production. The plant typically grows as a tree with a straight trunk and can reach heights of up to 30 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface, while its flowers are small and clustered in panicles. This variety is valued for its latex yield and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
