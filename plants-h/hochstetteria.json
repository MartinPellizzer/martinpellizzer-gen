    "intro": "Hochstetteria, commonly known as the New Zealand fern tree, is a unique genus of evergreen shrubs native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, compound leaves that are often used in traditional M\u0101ori basketry. The plant typically grows in coastal and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained soils and mild climates. Hochstetteria species are known for their ability to form dense, low-growing clumps, making them suitable for ornamental landscaping. Due to habitat loss, some species are now considered threatened, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts."
