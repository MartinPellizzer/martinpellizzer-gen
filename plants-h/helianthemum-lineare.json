    "intro": "Helianthemum lineare, commonly known as the linear sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy, blue-green leaves that are linear in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact form and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
