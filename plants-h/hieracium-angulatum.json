It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom from late spring to early summer. Hieracium angulatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
