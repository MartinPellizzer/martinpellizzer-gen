    "intro": "Hieracium speluncarum, commonly known as the cave hawkweed, is a rare and elusive plant species found in subterranean environments such as caves and rock crevices. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant thrives in low-light conditions, adapting to the dim and humid microclimates of its habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its specialized habitat, Hieracium speluncarum is considered a vulnerable species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
