It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of slender, leafy stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in coastal areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Its adaptability to harsh environments makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
