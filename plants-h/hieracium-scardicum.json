    "intro": "Hieracium scardicum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive serrated edge, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium scardicum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
