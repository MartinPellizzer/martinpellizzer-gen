    "intro": "Hedysarum ussuriense f. glabrum, commonly known as the Ussuri Hesperaloe, is a perennial legume native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) foliage and pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in ecological restoration projects. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and small spaces."
