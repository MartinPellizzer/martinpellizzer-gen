    "intro": "Hyospathe elata, commonly known as the giant hyoscyamus, is a striking member of the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to purple, often with a distinctive yellow or green throat. Its leaves are broad, ovate, and often have a velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to handle the plant with care, as all parts can be harmful if ingested."
