    "intro": "Hedyotis arborea, commonly known as the treey inchplant, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and India. It is a small, evergreen shrub that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky hillsides. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hedyotis arborea is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
