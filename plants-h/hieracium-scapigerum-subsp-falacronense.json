The plant has basal rosettes of leaves and produces tall, unbranched stems with small, yellowish-green flowers. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
