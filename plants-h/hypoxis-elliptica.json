It features a short, upright stem with grass-like, elliptical leaves that are dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night, emitting a mild fragrance. Its flowering period typically occurs in the summer months, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Hypoxis elliptica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
