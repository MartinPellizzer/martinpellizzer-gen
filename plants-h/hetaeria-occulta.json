The plant features delicate, slender stems and small, pale green leaves that blend seamlessly with its surroundings. Its flowers are inconspicuous, with a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Hetaeria occulta is considered endangered and is the subject of ongoing botanical research."
