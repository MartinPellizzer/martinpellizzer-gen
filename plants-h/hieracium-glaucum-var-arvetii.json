    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum var. arvetii, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal and stem leaves that are lanceolate to ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in open habitats and is considered a characteristic species of calcareous grasslands."
