    "intro": "Hieracium leurolonchum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
