    "intro": "Hieracium praealtiforme, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats."
