    "intro": "Hieracium excretum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, basal leaves that form a rosette. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in various parts of Europe and Asia. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native species in certain ecosystems."
