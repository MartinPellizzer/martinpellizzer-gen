    "intro": "Hieracium porrifolium subsp. inulifolium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a single terminal head, and are surrounded by a series of involucral bracts. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which is more lobed and resembles that of the genus Inula."
