    "intro": "Hieracium capillosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Hieracium capillosum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
