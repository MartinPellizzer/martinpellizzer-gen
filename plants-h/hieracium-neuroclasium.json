    "intro": "Hieracium neuroclasium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
