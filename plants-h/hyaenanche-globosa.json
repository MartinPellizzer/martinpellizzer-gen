    "intro": "Hyaenanche globosa, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its spherical, blue or purple flower heads that are surrounded by spiny, bracts. The plant has a rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that give way to fluffy, white seed heads. Hyaenanche globosa is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and drought tolerance."
