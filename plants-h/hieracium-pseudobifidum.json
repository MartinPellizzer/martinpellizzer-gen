    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum, commonly known as the false two-lobed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. This species is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
