    "intro": "Hypericum elodeoides, commonly known as water St. John's wort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems that often float on the water surface, supported by gas-filled tissues that aid in buoyancy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slight reddish hue. Hypericum elodeoides is commonly found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches."
