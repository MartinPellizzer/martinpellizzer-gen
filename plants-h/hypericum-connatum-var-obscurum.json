It is characterized by its slender, often purplish stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically narrow and opposite, with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by its darker stem color compared to other Hypericum species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
