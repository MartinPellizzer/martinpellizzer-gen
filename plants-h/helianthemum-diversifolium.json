    "intro": "Helianthemum diversifolium, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and they bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
