It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, and the flowers are small and yellowish. The variety exserens is distinguished by its elongated pappus hairs, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds."
