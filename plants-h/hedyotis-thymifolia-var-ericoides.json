    "intro": "Hedyotis thymifolia var. ericoides, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. The plant has thin, wiry stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
