    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera var. cordata, commonly known as the rough hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, showy inflorescences that range from white to pink or blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental value. This variety is relatively hardy and thrives in partial shade with moist, well-drained soil."
