    "intro": "Hesperis pallasii subsp. humilis, commonly known as the humble horned poppy, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, with prominent, horn-like structures at the base of the petals. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
