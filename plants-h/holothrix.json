    "intro": "Holothrix, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique, spiny or warty leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to red. These plants are typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where they can tolerate salt spray and well-drained conditions. Holothrix species are often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance and hardy nature. Their growth habit is generally compact, making them suitable for rock gardens or as border plants."
