    "intro": "Hemiphues bellidioides, commonly known as the bellidium heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters, providing a dense ground cover. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
