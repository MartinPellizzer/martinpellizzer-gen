    "intro": "Hamosa kelloggiana, commonly known as the Kellogg's hamosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. Due to habitat loss, Hamosa kelloggiana is considered endangered and is protected in several states."
