    "intro": "Hammatocaulis cretica, commonly known as the Crete stonecress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many species with small, cruciform flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is characterized by its low, mat-forming growth habit. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, rounded pods that contain several seeds."
