It typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality. Hemarthria debilis is also a valuable food source for various herbivorous wildlife species."
