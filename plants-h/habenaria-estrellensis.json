    "intro": "Habenaria estrellensis, commonly known as the Estrellan orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species."
