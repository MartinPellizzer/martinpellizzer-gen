    "intro": "Hypericum uliginosum var. prostratum, commonly known as swamp St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland habitats in North America. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on moist soil. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs. It is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds where the soil remains consistently damp."
