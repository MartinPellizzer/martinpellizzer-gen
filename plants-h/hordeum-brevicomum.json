    "intro": "Hordeum brevicomum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, sturdy stalks, typically reaching heights of less than 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing two-rowed grains, which are similar in structure to those of other barley species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hordeum brevicomum is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
