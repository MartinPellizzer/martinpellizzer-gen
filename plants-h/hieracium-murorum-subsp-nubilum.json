    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. nubilum, commonly known as the clouded hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture, and its flowers are arranged in a single terminal head. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost cloud-like appearance of the flower head, giving it its common name."
