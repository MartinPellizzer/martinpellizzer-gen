    "intro": "Hakea hastata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern and southern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or club-shaped inflorescences that produce small, bright yellow flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Hakea hastata is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
