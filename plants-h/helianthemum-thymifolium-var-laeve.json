    "intro": "Helianthemum thymifolium var. laeve, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
