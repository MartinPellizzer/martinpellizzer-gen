It is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its fruits are capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. Hirtella cordifolia is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant."
