    "intro": "Hypochaeris hirsuta, commonly known as hairy false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom from spring to autumn. Hypochaeris hirsuta is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in meadows, and it is considered a weed in some regions. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
