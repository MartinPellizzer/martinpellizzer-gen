It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or loamy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover in woodland settings."
