    "intro": "Henckelia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf henckelia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous terrain. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually hairy and have a bluish-green hue. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in dense inflorescences, and come in shades of white or pale purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henckelia humilis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
