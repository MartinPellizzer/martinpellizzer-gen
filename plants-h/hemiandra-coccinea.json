    "intro": "Hemiandra coccinea, commonly known as the red-flowered hemiandra, is a striking plant native to the rainforests of northeastern Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 2-5 meters, featuring smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its vibrant, tubular red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat. Hemiandra coccinea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance."
