    "intro": "Hutera leptocarpa f. robusta, commonly known as the robust hutera, is a variant of the hutera plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves and robust growth habit, which make it well adapted to humid, tropical environments. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in greenish-white or pale yellow hues. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual appeal."
