    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. trichotum, commonly known as the hairy wood hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and meadows, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its flowers are followed by small, oval achenes with persistent pappus bristles. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
