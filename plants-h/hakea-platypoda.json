    "intro": "Hakea platypoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of needle-like leaves and its striking, urn-shaped red or orange flowers. The plant produces woody, cone-like seed capsules that open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Hakea platypoda is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
