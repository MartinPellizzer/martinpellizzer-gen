    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pravipes, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, which is surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The subspecies pravipes is distinguished by its longer, more upright stems and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium pilosella."
