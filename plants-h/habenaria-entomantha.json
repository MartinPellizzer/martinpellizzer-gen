    "intro": "Habenaria entomantha, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on tree bark or in shaded forest understories, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its roots are highly specialized, forming a symbiotic relationship with fungi to absorb essential nutrients from the environment. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
