    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. macilentigenum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers arranged in a head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, waste areas, and along roadsides. Due to its low-growing habit and rapid spread, it can become invasive in certain habitats."
