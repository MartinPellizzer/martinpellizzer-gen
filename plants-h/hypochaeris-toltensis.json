It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk, typical of the genus Hypochaeris. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and open areas. Hypochaeris toltensis is also notable for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
