    "intro": "Hieracium nodiferum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. Hieracium nodiferum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
