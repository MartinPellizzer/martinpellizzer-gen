    "intro": "Hedypnois polymorpha var. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan hedypnois, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the island of Crete. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in sunny, well-drained environments. Its morphology is adapted to the Mediterranean climate, with a short growing season and drought-resistant features. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
