    "intro": "Hieracium hitchcockii, commonly known as Hitchcock's hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head at the end of each flowering stem. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant is perennial, with a mat-forming growth habit, and is often found in areas with well-drained soils. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and contributes to the ecological diversity of its native environment."
