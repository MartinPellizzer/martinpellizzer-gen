    "intro": "Heliconia bella, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, lobster-claw-shaped inflorescences. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are often used in floral arrangements due to their vibrant color and texture. Heliconia bella thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to its bright red bracts."
