    "intro": "Helminthia spinosa, commonly known as the spiny hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features upright, sparsely branched stems that are often covered in stiff, spine-tipped hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a rough, serrated edge. Helminthia spinosa is adapted to grow in dry, rocky soils and is often found in woodland or scrubland habitats."
