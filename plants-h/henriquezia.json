    "intro": "Henriquezia, commonly known as the \"Copperleaf\" or \"Copperplant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their striking, copper-colored leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Henriquezia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often growing in moist, shaded environments. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
