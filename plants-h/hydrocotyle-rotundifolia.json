    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rotundifolia, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features rounded, succulent leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, often in clusters at the leaf axils. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective pioneer species in disturbed wetland areas."
