    "intro": "Heliocarpus rudis, commonly known as the yellow mangrove, is a tropical tree native to parts of South America. It is characterized by its woody, cylindrical fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in coastal areas or wetlands. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitat. Heliocarpus rudis is also valued for its hard, durable wood used in construction and furniture-making."
