    "intro": "Heteromera macrocarpa, commonly known as the large-fruited heteromera, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are followed by large, fleshy, berry-like fruits. These fruits are typically red or orange when mature and are an important food source for various wildlife species. Heteromera macrocarpa is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
