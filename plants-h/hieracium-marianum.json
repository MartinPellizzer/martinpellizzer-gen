    "intro": "Hieracium marianum, commonly known as Mary's thimble, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. It produces yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium marianum is often considered a weed but has historical uses in folk medicine."
