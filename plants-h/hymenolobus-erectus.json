    "intro": "Hymenolobus erectus, commonly known as the erect hymenolobus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its erect growth habit and showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically has palmately lobed leaves and produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed in horticulture."
