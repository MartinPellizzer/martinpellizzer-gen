    "intro": "Hippion maritimum, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its blue or violet flower heads surrounded by spiny, leaf-like bracts. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in salty air. Sea holly is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
