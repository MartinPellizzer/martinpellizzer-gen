It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous flowering stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in some regions."
