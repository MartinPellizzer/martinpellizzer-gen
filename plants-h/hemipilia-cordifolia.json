    "intro": "Hemipilia cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Hemipilia cordifolia is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
