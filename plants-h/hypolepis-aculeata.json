    "intro": "Hypolepis aculeata, commonly known as the prickly shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins and spore-producing structures called sori. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its fronds are often covered with small, sharp spines, which give it its common name. Hypolepis aculeata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
