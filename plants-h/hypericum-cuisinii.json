It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are oval with a slightly hairy texture. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It has a long flowering period, making it a valuable plant for pollinators. However, it is not widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its modest appearance."
