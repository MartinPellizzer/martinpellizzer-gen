    "intro": "Hibiscus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically lobed and have a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange throat. Hibiscus cuneatus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a beautiful and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
