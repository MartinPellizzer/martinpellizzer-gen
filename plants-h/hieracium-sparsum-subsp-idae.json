    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. idae, commonly known as the Idaho hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
