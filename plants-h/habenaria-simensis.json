    "intro": "Habenaria simensis, commonly known as the Simese butterfly orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Ethiopia. It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers with intricate patterns and vibrant colors. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
