    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils, and it is often found in disturbed areas. Its hairy leaves and stems provide it with some drought resistance, and it produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers that attract various pollinators. Heteropappus hispidus is also known for its ability to thrive in arid conditions, making it an important species in xerophytic ecosystems."
