    "intro": "Hahnia suecica, commonly known as the Swedish hahnia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hahnia suecica is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
