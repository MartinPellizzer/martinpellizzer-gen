    "intro": "Hymenophyllum dejectum, commonly known as the drooping fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear as a carpet on tree trunks and rocks. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are closely spaced and have a leathery texture, which helps reduce water loss. Hymenophyllum dejectum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for small organisms."
