    "intro": "Hedera canariensis var. azorica, commonly known as the Azorean ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Azores. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
