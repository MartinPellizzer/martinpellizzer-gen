    "intro": "Heuchera erubescens, commonly known as the red earshade, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red or orange foliage that contrasts with its green stems. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera erubescens is valued for its ornamental leaves and its ability to add color to shady garden spaces."
