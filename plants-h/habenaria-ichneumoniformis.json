    "intro": "Habenaria ichneumoniformis, commonly known as the ichneumon fly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often fragrant flowers that resemble the appearance of ichneumon wasps. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats and has a slender, erect stem with a single or few flowers at the top. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native ecosystems."
