    "intro": "Hieracium glomerabile, commonly known as clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and slightly hairy. Hieracium glomerabile is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
