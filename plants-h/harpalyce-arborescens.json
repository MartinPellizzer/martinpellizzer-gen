    "intro": "Harpalyce arborescens, commonly known as the tree harpalyce, is a shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, flat, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert or semi-desert environments."
