It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding vibrant color to rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
