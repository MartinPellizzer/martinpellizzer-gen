    "intro": "Hornstedtia minor, commonly known as the lesser hornstedtia, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. Its small, green leaves are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces tiny white to pale yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
