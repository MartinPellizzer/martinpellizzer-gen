    "intro": "Hirculus gracilis, commonly known as the slender goat plant, is a rare and delicate flowering species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help to reduce water loss in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Hirculus gracilis is considered a vulnerable species."
