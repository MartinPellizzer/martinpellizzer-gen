It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories. It has small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
