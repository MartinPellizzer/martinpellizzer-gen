    "intro": "Halopeplis nodulosa, commonly known as the nodular halopeplis, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits. Its growth habit is typically low and spreading, making it well adapted to sandy or disturbed soils. Halopeplis nodulosa is often found in coastal areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
