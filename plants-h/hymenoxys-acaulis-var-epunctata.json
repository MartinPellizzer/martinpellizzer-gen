    "intro": "Hymenoxys acaulis var. epunctata, commonly known as the spotted leaf sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often spotted or streaked with white or yellow markings. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head, which is surrounded by bracts. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical features make it an attractive and drought-tolerant addition to native plant gardens."
