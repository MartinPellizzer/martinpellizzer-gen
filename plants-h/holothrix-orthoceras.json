    "intro": "Holothrix orthoceras, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a unique lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a green alga. It typically grows on rocky surfaces in arid or semi-arid environments, where it can tolerate extreme conditions. The plant's structure consists of a dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to the substrate. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead relying on its symbiotic partners for nutrients and photosynthesis. Holothrix orthoceras plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitats for other organisms in its ecosystem."
