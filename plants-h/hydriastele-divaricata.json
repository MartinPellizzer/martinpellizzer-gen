    "intro": "Hydriastele divaricata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiraling arrangement of leaves that give it a unique and elegant appearance. The plant has long, slender fronds that arise from a central rhizome, creating a dense, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. Hydriastele divaricata prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in humid environments."
