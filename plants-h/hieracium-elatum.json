It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence.
