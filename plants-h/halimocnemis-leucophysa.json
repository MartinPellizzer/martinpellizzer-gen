    "intro": "Halimocnemis leucophysa, commonly known as the white-veined dune grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal plains. The plant features narrow, linear leaves with prominent white veins, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in loose inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and arid conditions, making it resilient to coastal environmental stresses. Its ecological role includes stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
