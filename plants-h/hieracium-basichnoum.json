    "intro": "Hieracium basichnoum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in certain ecosystems. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
