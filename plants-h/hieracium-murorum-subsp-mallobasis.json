    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. mallobasis, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies mallobasis is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other Hieracium species. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides or in meadows, and is often found in temperate climates. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in various habitats."
