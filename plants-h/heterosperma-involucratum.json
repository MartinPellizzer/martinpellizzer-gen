It has long, narrow leaves that are usually less than 10 cm in length, and its flowers are typically blue or purple in color. The plant is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats on water surfaces. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in wetland ecosystems."
