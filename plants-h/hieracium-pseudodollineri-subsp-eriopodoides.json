    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodollineri subsp. eriopodoides, commonly known as the woolly-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
