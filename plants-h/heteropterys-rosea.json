    "intro": "Heteropterys rosea, commonly known as the pink velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Heteropterys rosea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as tropical forests and along stream banks."
