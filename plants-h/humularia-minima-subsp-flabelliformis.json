    "intro": "Humularia minima subsp. flabelliformis, commonly known as the flabelliform humularia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to parts of Central and South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in the dappled light conditions. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species within its native range."
