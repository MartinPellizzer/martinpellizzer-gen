    "intro": "Hemionitis scalariformis, commonly known as the scalloped spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the family Pteridaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, scalloped-shaped fronds that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome that produces both roots and upright, spore-bearing shoots. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Hemionitis scalariformis is notable for its ability to form dense mats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitats."
