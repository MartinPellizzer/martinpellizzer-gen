    "intro": "Hieracium hypochaerideum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The species is known for its ability to spread rapidly through both seeds and rhizomes."
