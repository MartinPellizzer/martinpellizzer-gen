    "intro": "Hieracium leiocephalum subsp. timaviense, commonly known as the Timaviensian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, particularly in the Balkans. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring moist and well-drained soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in a fluffy, composite flower head. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique ecological adaptations."
