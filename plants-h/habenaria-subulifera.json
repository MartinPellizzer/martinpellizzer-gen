    "intro": "Habenaria subulifera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swamps. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
