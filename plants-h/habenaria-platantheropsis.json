It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and forest understories. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in its native habitats."
