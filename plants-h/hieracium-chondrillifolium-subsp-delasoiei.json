    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. delasoiei, commonly known as the Delasoie's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are arranged in a single head. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its specific ecological requirements and limited distribution."
