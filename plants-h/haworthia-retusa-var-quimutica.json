    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. quimutica, commonly known as the quimutica Haworthia, is a compact, leafy succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with white tubercles and translucent windows, which are adaptations for storing water and light. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
