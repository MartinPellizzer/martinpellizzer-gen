    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. fojnicense, commonly known as the Fojnina hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the inflorescence consists of ray florets surrounding a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
