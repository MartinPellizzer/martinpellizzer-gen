    "intro": "Hesperis littorea, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant has a short, upright stem with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hesperis littorea is often found in dunes, cliffs, and other maritime habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
