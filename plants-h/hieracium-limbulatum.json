    "intro": "Hieracium limbulatum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium limbulatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
