    "intro": "Helipterum albicans f. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine helipterum, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. This subspecies is adapted to high-altitude environments, exhibiting compact growth and a silver-gray foliage to reduce water loss. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
