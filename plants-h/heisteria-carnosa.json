    "intro": "Heisteria carnosa, commonly known as the wax plant, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that store water, making it drought-tolerant. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun. Heisteria carnosa is often grown as an ornamental plant for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
