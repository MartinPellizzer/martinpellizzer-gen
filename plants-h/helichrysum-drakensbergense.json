    "intro": "Helichrysum drakensbergense, commonly known as the Drakensberg everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its profusion of golden-yellow flower heads that resemble small, dried flowers, hence its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in tight clusters, and it is well adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often covered in a fine, white coating that helps reduce water loss. Helichrysum drakensbergense is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and as a bedding plant."
