It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that can be white, pink, or red, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant has strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a basal rosette of fleshy, white bulbs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy to bloom successfully. Hippeastrum mannii is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant flowers and relatively easy care requirements."
