    "intro": "Habenaria tetrapetaloides, commonly known as the four-petaled orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions like Thailand and the Philippines. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a raceme, with four petals that give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
