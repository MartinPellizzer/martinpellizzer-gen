    "intro": "Helianthus discolor, commonly known as the palecored sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It features showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a disc of smaller, pale yellow to white florets, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its composite flower head attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies, making it an important plant in native ecosystems."
