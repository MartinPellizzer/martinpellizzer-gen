It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium hololeptum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
