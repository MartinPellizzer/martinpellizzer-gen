It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disk. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
