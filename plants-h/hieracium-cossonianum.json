    "intro": "Hieracium cossonianum, commonly known as Cosson's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cossonianum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
