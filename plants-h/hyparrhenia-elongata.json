It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, tufted growth pattern. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed areas.
