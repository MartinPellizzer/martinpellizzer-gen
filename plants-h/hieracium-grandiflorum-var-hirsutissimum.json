    "intro": "Hieracium grandiflorum var. hirsutissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can compete with native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
