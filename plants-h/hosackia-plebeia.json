    "intro": "Hosackia plebeia, commonly known as the slender false indigo, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pea-like flowers. The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system typical of many legumes. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Hosackia plebeia is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a nectar source for pollinators."
