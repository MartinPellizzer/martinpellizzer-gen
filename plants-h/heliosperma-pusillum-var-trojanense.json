    "intro": "Heliosperma pusillum var. trojanense, commonly known as the Trojan dwarf water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it forms dense mats on the sediment. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, floating leaves that are oval in shape. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, often appearing in late spring to early summer. This variety is notable for its compact growth and adaptation to nutrient-rich aquatic habitats."
