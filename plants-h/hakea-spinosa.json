    "intro": "Hakea spinosa, commonly known as the spinous hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its spiny, needle-like leaves that are typically green and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea spinosa is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
