    "intro": "Hieracium ruprechtii subsp. jailanum, commonly known as the mountain groundsel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are usually lanceolate or ovate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
