It is characterized by its robust growth habit, with tall, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It is well adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used for forage and erosion control. Its rapid growth and high biomass make it a valuable plant in agricultural and ecological contexts."
