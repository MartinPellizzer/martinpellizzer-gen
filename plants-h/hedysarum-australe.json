    "intro": "Hedysarum australe, commonly known as the Australian needlepod, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Australia. It features slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces elongated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum australe is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in ecological restoration projects."
