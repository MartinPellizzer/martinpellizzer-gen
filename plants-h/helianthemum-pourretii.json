    "intro": "Helianthemum pourretii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 15 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Helianthemum pourretii is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to dry, coastal or desert conditions."
