The plant features opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical collections and conservation efforts."
