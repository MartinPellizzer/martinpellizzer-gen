    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. karjaginii, commonly known as the Karjagin's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flower heads that are typically clustered in a single terminal inflorescence. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
