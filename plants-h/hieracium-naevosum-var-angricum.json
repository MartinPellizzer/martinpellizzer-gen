    "intro": "Hieracium naevosum var. angricum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can invade native plant communities."
