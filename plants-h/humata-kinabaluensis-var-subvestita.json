    "intro": "Humata kinabaluensis var. subvestita, commonly known as the Bornean velvet fern, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It is characterized by its unique, velvety texture, which is due to the dense covering of fine, soft hairs on its foliage. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette formation. It produces delicate, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the cooler months, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its restricted habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat degradation and climate change."
