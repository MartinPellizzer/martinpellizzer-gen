    "intro": "Helianthemum polifolium var. tomentellum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in a fine, woolly pubescence that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a desirable ornamental plant in Mediterranean climates."
