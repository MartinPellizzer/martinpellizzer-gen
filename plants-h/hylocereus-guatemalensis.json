    "intro": "Hylocereus guatemalensis, commonly known as the white night bloomer, is a climbing cactus native to Central America. It is characterized by its spineless stems and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in warm, arid environments and requires well-draining soil. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
