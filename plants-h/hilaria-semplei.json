    "intro": "Hilaria semplei, commonly known as the desert grass or silky grass, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, pale blue to purple flowers. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Hilaria semplei is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
