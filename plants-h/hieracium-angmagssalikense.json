It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are usually basal and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, contributing to the biodiversity of its alpine and tundra ecosystems."
