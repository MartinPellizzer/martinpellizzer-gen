    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. neurostegum, commonly known as the mouse ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The variant neurostegum is distinguished by its dense, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its preferred habitats."
