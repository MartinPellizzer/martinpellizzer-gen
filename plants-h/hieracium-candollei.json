    "intro": "Hieracium candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively."
