    "intro": "Habenaria dentifera, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often clustered in a raceme, with a distinctive toothed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
