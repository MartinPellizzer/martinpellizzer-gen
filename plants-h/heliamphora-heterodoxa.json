    "intro": "Heliamphora heterodoxa, commonly known as the heterodox sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its distinctive pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky fluid to trap insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and have a waxy coating that enhances their trapping efficiency. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with nutrient-poor soil, relying on insect prey for essential nutrients. Heliamphora heterodoxa is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and ecological adaptations."
