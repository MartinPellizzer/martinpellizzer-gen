    "intro": "Hazomalania voyronii, commonly known as the Voyron's hazomalania, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, velvety leaves and showy, pentagonal flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
