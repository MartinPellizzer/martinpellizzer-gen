    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. glaberrimum, commonly known as the smooth sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are characteristic of the Cistaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
