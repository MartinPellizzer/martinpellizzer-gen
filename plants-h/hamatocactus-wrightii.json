It is a columnar cactus with a tall, spiny stem that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant features dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a deep root system adapted to arid environments. This cactus is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
