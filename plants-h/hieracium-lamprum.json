    "intro": "Hieracium lamprum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces showy yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium lamprum typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
