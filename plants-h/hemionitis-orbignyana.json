    "intro": "Hemionitis orbignyana, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or on shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are located on the undersides of the fronds. Hemionitis orbignyana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
