    "intro": "Hieracium coadunaticeps, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and are often clustered in small inflorescences. The plant has hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of rocky shores. Hieracium coadunaticeps plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing nectar for pollinators."
