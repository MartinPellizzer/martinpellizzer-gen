    "intro": "Helianthemum stabianum, commonly known as the Stabian rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its leaves are typically small, oval, and covered in a similar hairy coating. Helianthemum stabianum is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils."
