    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 obtusifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its invasive potential in some regions. The species is known for its ornamental value but can also be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
