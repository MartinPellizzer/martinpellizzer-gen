    "intro": "Helianthemum niloticum var. microcarpum, commonly known as the Nile sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rocky or sandy soils. The fruit is a small, dry capsule that disperses seeds through wind, aiding in its survival in harsh climates."
