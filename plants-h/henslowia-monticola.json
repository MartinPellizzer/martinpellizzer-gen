    "intro": "Henslowia monticola, commonly known as the mountain henslowia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Arecaceae, which includes palms, and is characterized by its distinctive, clustered growth habit. The plant features a short, stout trunk and pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by wind. Henslowia monticola is adapted to cold, humid environments and is often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows."
