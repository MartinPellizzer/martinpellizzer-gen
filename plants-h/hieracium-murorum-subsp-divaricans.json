    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. divaricans, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist grasslands, meadows, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, surrounded by pale green to yellowish involucral bracts. This subspecies is notable for its aggressive growth and ability to form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
