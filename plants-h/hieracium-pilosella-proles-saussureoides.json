The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a basal rosette structure, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its aggressive spreading habit, often forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation."
