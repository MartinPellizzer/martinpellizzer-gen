    "intro": "Hoheria lyallii var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth hoheria, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green color. The plant produces striking clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds like the native honeyeater. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a valued species in New Zealand's flora."
