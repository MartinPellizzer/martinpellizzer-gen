    "intro": "Heliophila arenaria subsp. acocksii, commonly known as the sand heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features slender, creeping stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its small, white or pale blue flowers bloom in clusters, usually during the warmer months. This subspecies is well-suited to harsh conditions and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
