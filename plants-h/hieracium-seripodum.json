    "intro": "Hieracium seripodum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often spreading through rhizomes. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
