    "intro": "Hieracium euchaetiiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its dense, woolly leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is often considered a weed."
