    "intro": "Homalium cauliflorum, commonly known as the red-flowered hollies, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red flowers that appear in clusters, often on the trunk and branches, a trait known as cauliflorism. The plant has glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Homalium cauliflorum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
