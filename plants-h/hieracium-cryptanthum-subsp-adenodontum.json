    "intro": "Hieracium cryptanthum subsp. adenodontum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, glandular hairs and a more compact structure compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
