    "intro": "Hymenophyllum, commonly known as the maidenhair fern, is a genus of small, delicate ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their finely divided, often hairy leaves and are typically found in moist, shaded environments. Hymenophyllum species are epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. Their leaves are usually narrow and have a distinctive, intricate venation pattern. The genus includes over 150 species, many of which are prized for their ornamental value and are often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
