    "intro": "Hansteinia stricta, commonly known as the stiff hansteinia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is often found in shaded, humid environments. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects water and nutrients. Its flowers are typically small and clustered, often in shades of red or purple, adding ornamental value. Hansteinia stricta is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in indoor conditions with proper care."
