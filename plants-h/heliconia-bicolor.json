    "intro": "Heliconia bicolor, commonly known as the red-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with numerous small, yellowish-white flowers clustered around a central axis. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps it thrive in humid, shaded environments. Heliconia bicolor is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
