    "intro": "Hippomarathrum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Mediterranean region and are characterized by their striking, spiky flowers and succulent leaves. The leaves are often fleshy and covered in a waxy coating, which helps them retain water in arid environments. Hippomarathrum species typically grow in coastal areas, where they withstand salty air and strong winds. Their unique appearance makes them popular in rock gardens and as ornamental plants."
