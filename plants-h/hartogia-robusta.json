    "intro": "Hartogia robusta, commonly known as the hardy milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, covered in soft, hairy foliage. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad and oval, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hartogia robusta is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
