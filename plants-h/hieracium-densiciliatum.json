    "intro": "Hieracium densiciliatum, commonly known as the dense-hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and arranged in a rosette, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
