    "intro": "Hieracium hibernicum, commonly known as the Irish hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow or orange, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Hieracium hibernicum is known for its ability to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
