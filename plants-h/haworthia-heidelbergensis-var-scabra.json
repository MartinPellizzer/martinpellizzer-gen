    "intro": "Haworthia heidelbergensis var. scabra, commonly known as the Heidelberg Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with a waxy, pale green surface and distinctive white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in fine, short spines, giving it a rugged appearance. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
