    "intro": "Henckelia medogensis, commonly known as the Medog lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited habitat and vulnerability to environmental changes, Henckelia medogensis is considered an endangered species."
