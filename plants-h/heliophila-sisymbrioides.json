    "intro": "Heliophila sisymbrioides, commonly known as the yellow water-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, while its stems and leaves remain above water. Heliophila sisymbrioides plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
