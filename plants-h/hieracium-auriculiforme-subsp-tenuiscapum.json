It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its slender stems. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinct auriculate base, giving it a characteristic appearance. It is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
