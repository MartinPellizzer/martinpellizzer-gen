    "intro": "Hakea fililoba, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Hakea fililoba is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
