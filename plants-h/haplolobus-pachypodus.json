It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy blue or purple flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that help it store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its leaves are often hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, contributing to its drought tolerance. Haplolobus pachypodus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
