    "intro": "Habenaria corymbosa, commonly known as the clustered helmet orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, often fragrant flowers that resemble small helmets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in rich, organic soil. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, and it produces clusters of small, colorful blooms during the warmer months. The orchid's unique morphology and ecological preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
