It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium subausterum is often found in disturbed habitats and can be invasive in certain regions."
