    "intro": "Helmontia, commonly known as the common helmontia, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Helmontia is often found in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to tolerate salt spray. Its botanical features make it an important component of coastal ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
