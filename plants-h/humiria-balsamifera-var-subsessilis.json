    "intro": "Humiria balsamifera var. subsessilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved balsamwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, balsam-scented leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow. The plant is known for its durable, heavy wood, which is highly valued in traditional crafts and construction. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
