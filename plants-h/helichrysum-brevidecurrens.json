    "intro": "Helichrysum brevidecurrens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a small, herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces dense clusters of tiny, papery bracts that remain colorful even after drying, making it popular in floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its foliage is typically narrow and linear, with a silvery or grayish underside that adds to its ornamental appeal."
