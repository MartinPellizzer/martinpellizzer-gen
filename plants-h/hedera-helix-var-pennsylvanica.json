    "intro": "Hedera helix var. pennsylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the eastern United States. It features dark green, glossy, heart-shaped leaves that are typically larger than those of common ivy. The plant produces small, pale yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its vigorous growth habit makes it suitable for ground cover or vertical planting in gardens."
