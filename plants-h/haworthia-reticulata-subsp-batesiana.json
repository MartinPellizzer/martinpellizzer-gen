    "intro": "Haworthia reticulata subsp. batesiana, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it store water efficiently. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
