    "intro": "Hieracium tournefortianum, commonly known as the Tournefort's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in a cluster at the top of the stem. Native to Europe, it thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows and woodland edges. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
