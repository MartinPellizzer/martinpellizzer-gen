    "intro": "Hoya purpurea, commonly known as the purple wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a trailing vine with thick, fleshy stems and oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoya purpurea thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
