    "intro": "Hieracium grandidens subsp. duplidens, commonly known as the doubleleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head that consists of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a composite head, and its leaves are usually covered with fine hairs. This subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, with leaves that are divided into two pairs of lobes, giving it its common name."
