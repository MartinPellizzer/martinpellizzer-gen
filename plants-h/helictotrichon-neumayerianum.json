It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and delicate, silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are arranged in panicle-like clusters, typical of many grass species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
