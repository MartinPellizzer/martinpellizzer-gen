    "intro": "Hieracium ampliradians, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and its yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and produces seeds in a fluffy, wind-dispersed form. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
