It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to golden-orange flower heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their longevity. Its leaves are typically silver-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
