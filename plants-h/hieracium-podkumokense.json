    "intro": "Hieracium podkumokense, commonly known as the Podkumok Meadowhawk, is a flowering plant native to the Carpathian region of Europe. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across its native habitat. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
