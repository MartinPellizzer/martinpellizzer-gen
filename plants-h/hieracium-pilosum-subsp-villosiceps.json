    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum subsp. villosiceps, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the main species, particularly in the density and structure of its pubescence."
