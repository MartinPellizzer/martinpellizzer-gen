    "intro": "Hymenophyllum retusilobum, commonly known as the rough-lobed hymenophyllum, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures. This epiphytic plant typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sporangia, which are borne on the undersides of its leaves. The plant's unique morphology and habitat make it a fascinating subject for botanical study."
