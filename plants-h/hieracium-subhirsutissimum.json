    "intro": "Hieracium subhirsutissimum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly cobweb-like covering on its stems and leaves, which provides protection against herbivores and environmental stress. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs in the summer, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
