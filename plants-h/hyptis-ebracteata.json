    "intro": "Hyptis ebracteata, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, arranged in spikes at the ends of the branches. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along riverbanks. Hyptis ebracteata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
