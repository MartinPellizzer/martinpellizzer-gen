    "intro": "Hieracium microcephalum var. subglandulosum, commonly known as the small-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are glandular-dotted, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets and a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds. This variant is characterized by its compact growth form and specialized leaf structures that aid in water retention and protection against herbivory."
