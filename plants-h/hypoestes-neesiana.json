    "intro": "Hypoestes neesiana, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, brightly colored, velvety leaves that often feature intricate patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes neesiana is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
