    "intro": "Hemionitis chaerophylla, commonly known as the sandmat, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It has a compact, cushion-like growth habit with small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white to pale blue flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Hemionitis chaerophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
