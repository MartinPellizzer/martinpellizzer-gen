    "intro": "Hormidium humile, commonly known as the low hormidium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid regions of North America. It typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. The plant has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hormidium humile plays a minor but important role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
