    "intro": "Hieracium euchaetiiforme subsp. glaucisetigerum, commonly known as the glaucous tigerhawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, which are surrounded by overlapping bracts. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. Its subspecific name, *glaucisetigerum*, refers to its bluish-green coloration and the tiger-like pattern on its leaves."
