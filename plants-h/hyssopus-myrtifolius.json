    "intro": "Hyssopus myrtifolius, commonly known as sweet hyssop, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. The plant produces spikes of blue to violet flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its aromatic foliage has been historically used in herbal medicine for its antiseptic and digestive properties. Hyssopus myrtifolius prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and borders."
