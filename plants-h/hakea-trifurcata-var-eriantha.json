    "intro": "Hakea trifurcata var. eriantha, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its rigid, spine-tipped leaves and clusters of small, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and inland heathlands. This species is adapted to dry conditions and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
