It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-rowed florets. Hordeum nudum-distichum is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in fields, thriving in a variety of soil types. It plays a role in ecological systems as a food source for various insects and small mammals."
