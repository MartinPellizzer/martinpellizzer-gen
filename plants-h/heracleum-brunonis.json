    "intro": "Heracleum brunonis, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, coarse-stemmed plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, with a hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in late summer, which are followed by spiky, brown seed pods. Its sap contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
