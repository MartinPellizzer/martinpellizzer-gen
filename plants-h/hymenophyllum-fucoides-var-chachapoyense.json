    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fucoides var. chachapoyense, commonly known as the Chachapoyan shield fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic fern native to the cloud forests of the Andes. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, leathery, and often densely packed leaves. The fronds are typically dark green with a metallic sheen and are covered in tiny, scale-like structures called rhizoids. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
