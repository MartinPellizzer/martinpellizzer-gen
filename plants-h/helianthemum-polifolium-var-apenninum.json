    "intro": "Helianthemum polifolium var. apenninum, commonly known as the Apennine sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features compact, dense foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for Mediterranean-style gardens."
