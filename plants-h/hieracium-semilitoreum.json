    "intro": "Hieracium semilitoreum, commonly known as the sea hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant thrives in salty, sandy soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators."
