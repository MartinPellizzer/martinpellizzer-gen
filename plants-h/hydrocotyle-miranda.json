    "intro": "Hydrocotyle miranda, commonly known as the silverleaf water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hydrocotyle miranda plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
