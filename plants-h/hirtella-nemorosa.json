    "intro": "Hirtella nemorosa, commonly known as the silky hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. These flowers are followed by small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and attract various wildlife. Hirtella nemorosa is often found in shaded, moist environments within forest understories."
