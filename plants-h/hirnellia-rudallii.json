    "intro": "Hirnellia rudallii, commonly known as the Kowhai of the South Island, is a rare and distinctive member of the Fabaceae family. It is native to New Zealand, specifically the South Island, where it grows in rocky and coastal environments. The plant is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which appear in clusters and bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are compound, typically with three leaflets, and the plant is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hirnellia rudallii is considered a vulnerable species."
