    "intro": "Hanabusaya asiatica, commonly known as the Asian ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. Its leaves are slender and often clustered at the base, while its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air. Due to its elusive nature and limited habitat, Hanabusaya asiatica is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
