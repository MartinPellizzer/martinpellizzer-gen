    "intro": "Hemizonia citrina, commonly known as the yellow sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hemizonia citrina is a member of the Boraginaceae family, known for its showy, often blue or purple flowers, though this species stands out with its distinctive yellow hue."
