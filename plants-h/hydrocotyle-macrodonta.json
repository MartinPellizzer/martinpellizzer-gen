    "intro": "Hydrocotyle macrodonta, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. Its root system helps stabilize sediment and improve water quality by filtering nutrients. Hydrocotyle macrodonta plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
