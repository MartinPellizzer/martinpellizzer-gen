    "intro": "Hieracium tanytrachelium, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and narrow, spiny leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense heads, typical of the dandelion family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its prickly foliage and showy blooms, it can be both a weed and a wildflower, depending on the ecosystem."
