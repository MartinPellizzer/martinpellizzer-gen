    "intro": "Hermannia passeriniformis, commonly known as the pink ghost orchid, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in the understory of tropical forests. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a rare and fascinating subject for botanical study. Due to habitat destruction, it is also considered endangered in its native range."
