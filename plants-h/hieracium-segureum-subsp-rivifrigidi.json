    "intro": "Hieracium segureum subsp. rivifrigidi, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are often hairy and have a rosette structure, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native range."
