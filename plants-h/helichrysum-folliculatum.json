    "intro": "Helichrysum folliculatum, commonly known as the golden crown, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that resemble tiny crowns. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum folliculatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
