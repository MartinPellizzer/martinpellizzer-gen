    "intro": "Heuchera villosa var. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features basal rosettes of fuzzy, dark green to reddish foliage that provide striking visual interest throughout the growing season. The plant produces upright clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to naturalize and spread via rhizomes, creating dense ground cover."
