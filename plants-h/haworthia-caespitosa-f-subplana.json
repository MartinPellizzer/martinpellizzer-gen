    "intro": "Haworthia caespitosa f. subplana, commonly known as the flat-leaf haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves that are notably flat and smooth, distinguishing it from other haworthia species. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall, slender stems during the cooler months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
