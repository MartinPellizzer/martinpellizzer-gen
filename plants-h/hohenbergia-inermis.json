    "intro": "Hohenbergia inermis, commonly known as the naked leaf hohenbergia, is a striking plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped growth habit. The plant features broad, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a textured surface. It produces inflorescences of white to pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Hohenbergia inermis is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
