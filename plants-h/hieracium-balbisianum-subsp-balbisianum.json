    "intro": "Hieracium balbisianum subsp. balbisianum, commonly known as the Balbisian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its yellowish to reddish flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
