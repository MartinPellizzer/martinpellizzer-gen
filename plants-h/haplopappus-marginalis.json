It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in prairie and steppe habitats. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation. Haplopappus marginalis is also noted for its low-growing habit and drought tolerance."
