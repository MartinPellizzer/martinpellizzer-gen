It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by pale green involucres. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
