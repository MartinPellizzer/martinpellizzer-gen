    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. pachyphyllum, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
