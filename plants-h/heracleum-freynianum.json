    "intro": "Heracleum freynianum, commonly known as the Freyn's cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America, particularly found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a coarse texture and a distinctive, sometimes fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces a fruit that is a dry, two-lobed schizocarp. The plant is often mistaken for other toxic members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance."
