    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. chloroscyphicum, commonly known as the green-topped hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, greenish-yellow flower heads, which are often more compact than those of other hawkweed species. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
