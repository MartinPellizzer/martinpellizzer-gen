It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a yellow or orange throat. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist or wet soil, often found near water bodies such as ponds and marshes. Hibiscus aquaticus is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a decorative and potentially invasive species in certain environments."
