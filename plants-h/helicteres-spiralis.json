    "intro": "Helicteres spiralis, commonly known as the spiral helicteres, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its striking spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically palmate, with five to seven lobes, and the plant often grows in moist, shaded environments. Helicteres spiralis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
