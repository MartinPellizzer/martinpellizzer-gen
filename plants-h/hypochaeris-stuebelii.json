    "intro": "Hypochaeris stuebelii, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with a distinctive central disk and surrounding ray florets, which bloom in the spring and summer. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. Hypochaeris stuebelii is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
