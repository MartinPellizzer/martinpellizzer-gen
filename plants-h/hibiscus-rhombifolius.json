    "intro": "Hibiscus rhombifolius, commonly known as the diamond-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive rhombic-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hibiscus rhombifolius thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for cultivation in arid or semi-arid regions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
