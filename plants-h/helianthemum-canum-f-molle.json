    "intro": "Helianthemum canum f. molle, commonly known as the soft sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or Mediterranean regions. Its leaves are succulent and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
