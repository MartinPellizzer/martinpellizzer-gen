    "intro": "Hypolepis woodii, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Hypolepis woodii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
