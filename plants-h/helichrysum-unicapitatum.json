    "intro": "Helichrysum unicapitatum, commonly known as the golden crown or Cape golden weed, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, sun-like flowers. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens due to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, which is why it is sometimes used in floral arrangements."
