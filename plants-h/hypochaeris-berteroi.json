    "intro": "Hypochaeris berteroi, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Hypochaeris berteroi is often considered an invasive species in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
