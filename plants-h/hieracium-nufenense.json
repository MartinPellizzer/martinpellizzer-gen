    "intro": "Hieracium nufenense, commonly known as the Nufenen hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium nufenense is often found in mountainous areas of the Alps and is a relatively rare species due to its specific environmental requirements."
