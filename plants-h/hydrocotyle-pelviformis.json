    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pelviformis, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a aquatic plant native to North America. It has rounded, floating leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its roots help stabilize sediment in wetland environments. It is often found in shallow waters, such as ponds and marshes, where it plays a role in maintaining water quality. Hydrocotyle pelviformis is an important component of aquatic ecosystems, supporting various invertebrates and fish species."
