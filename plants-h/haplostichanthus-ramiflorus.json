    "intro": "Haplostichanthus ramiflorus, commonly known as the branched-flower cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in dense, branched clusters. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is adapted to grow in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
