    "intro": "Habenaria henscheniana, commonly known as the Henschen's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that bloom during the wet season. Habenaria henscheniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral structure."
