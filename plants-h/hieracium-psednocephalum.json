    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracium pseudcephalum, commonly known as the false hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are deeply lobed and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, rounded shape. It is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance."
