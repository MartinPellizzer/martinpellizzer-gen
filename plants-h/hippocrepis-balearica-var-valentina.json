    "intro": "Hippocrepis balearica var. valentina, commonly known as the Valencian rock orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Balearic Islands. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, featuring small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a fibrous root system and thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found in coastal or limestone habitats. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, contributing to its ability to conserve water in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
