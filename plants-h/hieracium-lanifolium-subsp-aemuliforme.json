    "intro": "Hieracium lanifolium subsp. aemuliforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fuzzy, woolly leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many flowering plants with composite flower heads. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, H. lanifolium."
