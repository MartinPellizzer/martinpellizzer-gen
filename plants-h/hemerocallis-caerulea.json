It features tall, upright stems that bear showy, six-petaled flowers in shades of blue to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a dense clump, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp habitats. Hemerocallis caerulea is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
