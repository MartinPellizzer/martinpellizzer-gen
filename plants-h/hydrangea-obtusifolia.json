    "intro": "Hydrangea obtusifolia, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, blue, or even red, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with broad, ovate leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in partial shade with moist, well-drained soil. Hydrangea obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
