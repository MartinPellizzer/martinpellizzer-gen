    "intro": "Helianthus pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered sunflower, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are typically clustered in a single head, which is a distinguishing feature from other sunflower species. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helianthus pauciflorus is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments."
