It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and often reddish in color. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing yellow petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
