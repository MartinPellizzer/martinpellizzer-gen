    "intro": "Hieracium placophyllum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. It features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange flowers in late summer. Hieracium placophyllum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
