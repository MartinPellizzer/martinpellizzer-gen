    "intro": "Hookera coronaria, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, cold environments. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, providing insulation against freezing temperatures. Hookera coronaria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in alpine gardens for its hardiness and visual appeal."
