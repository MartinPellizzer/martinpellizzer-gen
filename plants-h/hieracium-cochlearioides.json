    "intro": "Hieracium cochlearioides, commonly known as the spiral hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a tall, branching stem that bears yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds in small, disk-like flower heads. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
