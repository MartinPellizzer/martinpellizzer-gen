    "intro": "Hedyotis insularis, commonly known as the island pennywort, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands, where it thrives in humid conditions. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes. Its roots are fibrous and often form dense mats, which help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hedyotis insularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in natural habitats."
