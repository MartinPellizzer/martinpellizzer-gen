    "intro": "Haworthia glabrata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Haworthia glabrata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
