    "intro": "Hypodematium microlepioides, commonly known as the small-scale liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a flattened, leaf-like body that is often covered in a layer of rhizoids. Its microscopic spore-producing structures, called soridia, are embedded in the thallus and are released in humid conditions. This species is notable for its delicate appearance and ecological role in nutrient cycling in moist habitats."
