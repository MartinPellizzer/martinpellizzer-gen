    "intro": "Hieracium apiculatidens, commonly known as the spiked hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a serrated edge, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium apiculatidens is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation and altering local ecosystems."
