    "intro": "Helichrysum selaginifolium, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, yellowish to golden-orange flowers that remain open for a long period. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, and its leaves are typically narrow and linear. It is often grown as a ornamental plant due to its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Helichrysum selaginifolium is also valued for its use in floral arrangements and traditional medicine."
