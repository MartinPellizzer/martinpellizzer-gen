    "intro": "Hieracium rubripilosella, commonly known as the red-hair hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its reddish-brown hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as those found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
