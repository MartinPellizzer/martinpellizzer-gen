It typically features dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone areas. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
