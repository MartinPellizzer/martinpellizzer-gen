    "intro": "Heteroneuron nigricans, commonly known as the black-stemmed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat and its ability to trap small prey using specialized bladder-like structures. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its stems are often dark in color, giving it its common name. Heteroneuron nigricans produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its botanical features reflect adaptations for both aquatic and terrestrial environments."
