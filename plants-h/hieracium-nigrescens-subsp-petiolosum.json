The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a hairy surface, while the stem is often reddish and slightly hairy. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
