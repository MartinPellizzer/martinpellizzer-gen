    "intro": "Hypericum involutum, commonly known as the spiral St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, lance-shaped leaves that often curl inward. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hypericum involutum is often found in rocky soils and open woodlands, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
