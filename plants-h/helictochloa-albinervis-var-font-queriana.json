It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves with distinct white veins running along the midrib. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky outcrops. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-bearing branches. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
