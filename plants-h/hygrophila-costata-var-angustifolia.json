    "intro": "Hygrophila costata var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along its stem. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in slow-moving streams and ponds. Its botanical structure makes it well adapted to wetland environments, where it plays a role in water filtration and habitat provision."
