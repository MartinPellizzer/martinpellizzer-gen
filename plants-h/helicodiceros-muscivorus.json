    "intro": "Helicodiceros muscivorus, commonly known as the moss-eating snail, is a species of air-breathing land snail. It belongs to the family Helicodermatidae and is characterized by its elongated, spiral shell. The plant is not a plant but a mollusk, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. However, it is often found in moist, shaded environments where it feeds on mosses and other decomposing organic matter. Its presence can indicate a healthy, undisturbed ecosystem."
