    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. tephroprenanthes, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a rare and ancient plant species with a unique botanical profile. It is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is typically found in calcareous soils in mountainous regions, reflecting its preference for specific environmental conditions. Its subspecies name, *tephroprenanthes*, alludes to its historical association with prehistoric landscapes. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical and paleobotanical study."
