    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. petraeum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that clasping the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
