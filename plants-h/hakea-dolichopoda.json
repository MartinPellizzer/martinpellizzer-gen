    "intro": "Hakea dolichopoda, commonly known as the long-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hakea dolichopoda is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing dunes. Its unique morphology and ecological significance make it an important species in local ecosystems."
