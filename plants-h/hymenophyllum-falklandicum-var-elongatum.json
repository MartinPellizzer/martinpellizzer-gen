It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant has a unique structure with a creeping rhizome and small, shield-shaped pinnae. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rock surfaces or in damp forest floors. This variety is notable for its specialized adaptations to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat."
