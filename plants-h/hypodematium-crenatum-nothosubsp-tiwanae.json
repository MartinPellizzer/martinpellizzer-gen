    "intro": "Hypodematium crenatum nothosubsp. tiwanae, commonly known as the Tiwanae hypodematium, is a rare, low-growing perennial herb native to the Andes of South America. It features small, clustered leaves with a distinctive crenate margin, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in dense inflorescences. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited geographic distribution, making it a subject of interest for taxonomists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited study, its conservation status remains uncertain."
