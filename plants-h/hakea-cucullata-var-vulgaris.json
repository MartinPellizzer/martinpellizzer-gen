    "intro": "Hakea cucullata var. vulgaris, commonly known as the broad-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are thick, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal and sandy gardens. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native birds and insects."
