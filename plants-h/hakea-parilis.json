    "intro": "Hakea parilis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in coastal environments and is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden air. Hakea parilis is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
