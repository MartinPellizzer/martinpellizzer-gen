    "intro": "Haematospermum, commonly known as the bloodroot or redroot, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apocynaceae. It is characterized by its striking red or orange flowers and milky sap, which can be toxic. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, often in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually simple and opposite, while its flowers are clustered in umbels. Haematospermum species are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their use is limited due to their toxic properties."
