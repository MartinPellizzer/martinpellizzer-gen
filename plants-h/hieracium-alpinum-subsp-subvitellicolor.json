    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. subvitellicolor, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver- or gray-green leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in alpine meadows and is considered a rare and sensitive species."
