    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. turbinatum, commonly known as the Turban Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and have a bluish-gray hue, which helps reduce water loss. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, consisting of many small florets arranged in a disk-like structure. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive turban-shaped flower heads, which give it its common name."
