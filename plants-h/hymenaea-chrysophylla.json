    "intro": "Hymenaea chrysophylla, commonly known as the yellow stinkwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing several flat, hard seeds. It is adapted to dry climates and has a deep root system to access groundwater. The plant is valued for its durable wood and has cultural significance in some African communities."
