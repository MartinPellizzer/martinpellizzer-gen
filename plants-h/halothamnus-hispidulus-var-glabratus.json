    "intro": "Halothamnus hispidulus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth halothamnus, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and gray-green, woolly leaves that are typically shorter and less hairy than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in terminal clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and extreme temperatures. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
