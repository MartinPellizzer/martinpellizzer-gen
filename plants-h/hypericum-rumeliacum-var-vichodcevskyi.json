It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to specific regions of Eastern Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericum genus. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
