    "intro": "Hemianemia karwinskyana, commonly known as the Karwinsky's hemianthus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom during the wet season. Hemianemia karwinskyana is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
