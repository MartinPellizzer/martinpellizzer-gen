    "intro": "Hieracium retardatum, commonly known as the slow-growing hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, grassy habitats. It is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
