    "intro": "Humboltia antennifera, commonly known as the hair-antlered tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Caribbean islands. It is characterized by its distinctive branched, hair-like appendages on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has opposite, elliptic leaves with a smooth surface and a strong, aromatic scent. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Humboltia antennifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
