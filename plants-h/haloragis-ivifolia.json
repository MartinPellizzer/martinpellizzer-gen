    "intro": "Haloragis ivifolia, commonly known as the common rivergrass, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetland habitats, such as along riverbanks and in marshy areas. The plant has slender, spreading stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale green, and they are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. Haloragis ivifolia is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks through its extensive root system."
