    "intro": "Hieracium praeflexuans, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium praeflexuans is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
