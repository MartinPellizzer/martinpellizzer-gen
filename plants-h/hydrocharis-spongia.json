    "intro": "Hydrocharis spongia, commonly known as the sponge waternymph, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, green, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a spongy, porous structure, which helps it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a delicate ornamental quality to ponds and lakes. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight. Due to its ability to filter water and provide habitat for aquatic life, it plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
