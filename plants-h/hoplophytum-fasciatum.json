    "intro": "Hoplophytum fasciatum, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a unique succulent native to South Africa. It features a distinctive appearance with its ribbed, cylindrical stems covered in pale green and brown stripes, resembling a zebra's pattern. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, adding ornamental value. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Due to its striking appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
