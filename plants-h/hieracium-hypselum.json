It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. Hieracium hypselum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed."
