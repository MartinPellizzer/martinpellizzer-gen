    "intro": "Humata pedata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in cool, shaded environments. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Humata pedata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a specialty plant in botanical collections."
