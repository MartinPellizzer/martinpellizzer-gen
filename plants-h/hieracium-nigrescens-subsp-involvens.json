    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. involvens, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a taproot system and produces numerous flowering stems that rise from the base. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the structure of its leaves and flower heads."
