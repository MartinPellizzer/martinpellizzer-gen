    "intro": "Hieracium poliocarenum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to Europe, including parts of the United Kingdom. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous small, daisy-like blooms. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is often considered a weed."
