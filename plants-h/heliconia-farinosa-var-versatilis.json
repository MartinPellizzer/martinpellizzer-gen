    "intro": "Heliconia farinosa var. versatilis, commonly known as the variable heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces long, slender inflorescences that bear small, clustered flowers, typical of the Heliconiaceae family. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a potted plant."
