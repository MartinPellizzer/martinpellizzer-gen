    "intro": "Hedyotis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved pennywort, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Hedyotis lancifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
