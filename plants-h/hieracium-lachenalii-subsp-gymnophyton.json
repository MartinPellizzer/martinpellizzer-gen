It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and shorter flower heads compared to other members of the species. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected plant in several European countries."
