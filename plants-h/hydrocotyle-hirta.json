    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirta, commonly known as hairy water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features rounded, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its small, white flowers are usually clustered in umbels, and it produces small, rounded fruits that disperse via water. Hydrocotyle hirta is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
