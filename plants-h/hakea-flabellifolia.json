It is characterized by its distinctive, flat, paddle-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea flabellifolia is adapted to arid environments and has a deep root system to access water. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
