    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. naevulatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive dark spots on the leaves and stems, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
