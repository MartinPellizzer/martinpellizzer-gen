    "intro": "Hieracium subindutoides, commonly known as the slender sandweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
