    "intro": "Haworthia deltoidea var. intermedia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically green with a bluish tint and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
