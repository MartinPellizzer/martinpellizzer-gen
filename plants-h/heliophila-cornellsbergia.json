It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
