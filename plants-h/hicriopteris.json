    "intro": "Hicriopteris, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plants typically produce small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or orange in color. Hicriopteris species are adapted to arid environments, making them drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and hardy nature."
