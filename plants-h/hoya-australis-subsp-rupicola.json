    "intro": "Hoya australis subsp. rupicola, commonly known as the rock hoya, is a succulent plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in clusters. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
