    "intro": "Heliophila incana, commonly known as the silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are usually hairy and have a silvery appearance, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
