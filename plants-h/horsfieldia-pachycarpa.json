    "intro": "Horsfieldia pachycarpa, commonly known as the thick-fruited orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often brightly colored fruits. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a variety of colors, and it relies on specific pollinators for reproduction. The thick, fleshy fruits are an adaptation for seed dispersal by animals, particularly birds and mammals."
