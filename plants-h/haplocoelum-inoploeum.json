    "intro": "Haplocoelum inoploeum, commonly known as the narrowleaf false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
