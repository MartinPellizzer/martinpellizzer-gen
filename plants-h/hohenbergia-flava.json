    "intro": "Hohenbergia flava, commonly known as the yellow hohenbergia, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a yellow or white midrib. The plant produces inflorescences that bear small, white or pale pink flowers, which bloom in summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia flava is popular as a decorative plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
