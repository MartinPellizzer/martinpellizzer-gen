    "intro": "Hakea circumalata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical branches and small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and ability to thrive in sandy soils make it well-suited to coastal environments. Hakea circumalata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion."
