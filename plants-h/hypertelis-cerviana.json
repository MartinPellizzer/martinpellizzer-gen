It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are clustered in inflorescences.
