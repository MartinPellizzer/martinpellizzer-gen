    "intro": "Heterotaenia paui, commonly known as the Pua fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heterotaenia paui is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
