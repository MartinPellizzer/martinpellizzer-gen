    "intro": "Helianthemum vineale, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
