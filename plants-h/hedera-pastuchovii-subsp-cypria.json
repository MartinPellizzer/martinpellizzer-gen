    "intro": "Hedera pastuchovii subsp. cypria, commonly known as the Cyprus ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the eastern Mediterranean, particularly Cyprus. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
