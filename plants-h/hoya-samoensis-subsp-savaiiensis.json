    "intro": "Hoya samoensis subsp. savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii hoya, is a rare species native to the islands of Samoa and Savaii. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family, characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is prized by hoya enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively slow growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
