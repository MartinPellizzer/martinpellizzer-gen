It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features opposite, linear leaves and produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers. It is known for its ability to withstand drought conditions due to its succulent stems and leaves. Hydrolea dichotoma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
