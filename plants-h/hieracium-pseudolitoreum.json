It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines. The plant features upright stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient coastal species."
