    "intro": "Hieracium lepidotum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium lepidotum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed in cultivated areas."
