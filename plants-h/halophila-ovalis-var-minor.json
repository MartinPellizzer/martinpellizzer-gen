    "intro": "Halophila ovalis var. minor, commonly known as the lesser sea whiskgrass, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is a submerged aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, brackish, and coastal waters. This variant is characterized by its smaller leaves compared to the typical H. ovalis, with a more compact growth form. It plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine organisms. The plant is often found in estuaries and tidal zones where it tolerates varying salinity levels."
