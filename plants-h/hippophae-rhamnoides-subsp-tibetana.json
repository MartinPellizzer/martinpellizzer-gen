    "intro": "Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. tibetana, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-orange berries that are rich in vitamin C and essential fatty acids. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for local wildlife."
