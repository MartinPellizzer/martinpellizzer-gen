    "intro": "Hydatella, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by their floating leaves and showy flowers. These plants are typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The leaves are often broad and have a waxy surface to repel water, while the flowers can be white, pink, or yellow. Hydatella species play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various organisms. Their reproductive structures are adapted for pollination by insects or water currents."
