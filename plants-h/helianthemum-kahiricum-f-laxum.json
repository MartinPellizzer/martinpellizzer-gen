It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
