    "intro": "Hydrocotyle humboldtii var. macrophylla, commonly known as Humboldt's spurge or giant water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically large, with a smooth surface and a distinctive light green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are often submerged or just at the water's surface. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it an important component of aquatic and riparian ecosystems. Its adaptability to wet conditions makes it a valuable indicator species for wetland health."
