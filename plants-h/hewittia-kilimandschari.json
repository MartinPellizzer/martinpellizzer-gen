    "intro": "Hewittia kilimandschari, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. Native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly the Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya areas, it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. It is characterized by its sympodial growth habit and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
