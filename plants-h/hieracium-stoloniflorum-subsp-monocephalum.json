    "intro": "Hieracium stoloniflorum subsp. monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, terminal flower head that blooms in late summer. The plant produces stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The flowers are typically yellow and are surrounded by bracts that are often mistaken for petals."
