    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. subflagelliflorum, commonly known as the slender-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a single head, with slender, linear rays. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
