    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rahmeri, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that help it capture sunlight for photosynthesis. Its stems are often rooted in the substrate, and it produces small, greenish flowers that are typically short-lived. Hydrocotyle rahmeri plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
