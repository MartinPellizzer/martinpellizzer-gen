    "intro": "Hieracium leptogrammum, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium leptogrammum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
