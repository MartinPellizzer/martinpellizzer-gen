    "intro": "Hedysarum grandiflorum subsp. grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It features compound leaves with 8 to 16 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets, and its most striking feature is its showy, pink to reddish-purple pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, lens-shaped pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. It is often found in open woodlands and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
