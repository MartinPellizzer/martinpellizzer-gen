    "intro": "Hieracium divaricatum, commonly known as the zigzag hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are somewhat zigzagging, giving it its common name. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
