It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and has a compact, bushy growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching.
