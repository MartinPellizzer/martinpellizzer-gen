    "intro": "Hippeastrum rutilum var. acuminatum, commonly known as the Acuminatum amaryllis, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a distinctive red or purple stripe down the center. The plant produces strap-shaped, dark green leaves that are broad and fleshy, typical of the Amaryllidaceae family. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant or in gardens with adequate sunlight."
