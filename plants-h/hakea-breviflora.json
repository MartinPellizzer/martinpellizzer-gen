    "intro": "Hakea breviflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces small, woody cones that contain edible seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for native wildlife. Hakea breviflora is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
