    "intro": "Heliotropium undulatum var. nubicum, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters, with slender, branching stems covered in fine, soft hairs. Its small, pale purple to pink flowers are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences and bloom during the warmer months. The plant has adapted to thrive in harsh environments through its succulent leaves and deep root system, which help it conserve water. It is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
