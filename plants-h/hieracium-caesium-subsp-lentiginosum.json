    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. lentiginosum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
