    "intro": "Helepta parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the temperate regions of southern Africa. It features dense clusters of tiny, pale green to white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
