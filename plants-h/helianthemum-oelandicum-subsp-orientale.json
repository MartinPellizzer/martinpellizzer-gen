    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. orientale, commonly known as the eastern rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in Mediterranean climates."
