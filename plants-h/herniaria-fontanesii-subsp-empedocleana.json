    "intro": "Herniaria fontanesii subsp. empedocleana, commonly known as the Mediterranean sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal and rocky habitats, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
