    "intro": "Hakea teretifolia subsp. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry, and often hairy foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain the seeds, typical of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species suited to coastal and sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for native gardens and landscaping."
