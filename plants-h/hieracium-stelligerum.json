    "intro": "Hieracium stelligerum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines and dunes. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium stelligerum is often found in disturbed coastal habitats and is adapted to withstand salty sea air and strong winds."
