    "intro": "Hieracium linguatellum, commonly known as the tongue-shaped hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are arranged in a single head with ray florets. Hieracium linguatellum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
