It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium exallum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
