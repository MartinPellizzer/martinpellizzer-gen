    "intro": "Humboltia rupestris, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a contrasting throat. Its leaves are usually small, narrow, and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Humboltia rupestris is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
