    "intro": "Helichrysum picardii, commonly known as the Picard's everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are often mistaken for true flowers, though they are actually composite inflorescences composed of many tiny florets. Helichrysum picardii is known for its ability to retain its color when dried, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
