It is characterized by its striking red or orange bulbous flower heads that resemble bells, which bloom during the winter months. The plant produces a cluster of small, white to yellow flowers at the base of the bell-shaped structure. It is native to South Africa and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This ornamental plant is often cultivated for its unique and eye-catching floral display."
