    "intro": "Helianthemum rubellum subsp. rotundifolium, commonly known as the round-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fleshy, rose-colored flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has rounded, thick leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
