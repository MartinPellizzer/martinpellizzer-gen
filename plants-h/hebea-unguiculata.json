It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its velvety, heart-shaped leaves and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a compact shrub, reaching heights of up to 30 cm, with a dense foliage that retains its color year-round. Hebea unguiculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot.
