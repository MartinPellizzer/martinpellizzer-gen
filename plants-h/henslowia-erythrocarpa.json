    "intro": "Henslowia erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited henslowia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family. Its most distinctive feature is its bright red, fleshy berries that persist through winter, providing food for wildlife. Henslowia erythrocarpa thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in association with other woodland plants."
