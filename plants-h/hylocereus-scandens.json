It is characterized by its spiny stems and large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, yellow or red fruits that are edible and often used in traditional medicine. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an adaptation to attract specific pollinators. The species is popular in horticulture for its ornamental value and unique flowering behavior."
