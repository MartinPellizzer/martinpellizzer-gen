It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Hubera hirta is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
