    "intro": "Hectorea villosissima, commonly known as the hairy heather, is a low-growing shrub native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Hectorea villosissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
