It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
