    "intro": "Hypericum erectum var. debile, commonly known as the slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its delicate appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
