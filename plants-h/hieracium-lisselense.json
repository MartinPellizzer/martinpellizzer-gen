    "intro": "Hieracium lisselense, commonly known as the smooth meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium lisselense is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
