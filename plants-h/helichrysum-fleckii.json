It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for actual petals. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum fleckii is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
