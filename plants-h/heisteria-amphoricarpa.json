    "intro": "Heisteria amphoricarpa, commonly known as the bottle-shaped heisteria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features a distinctive, swollen, bottle-like stem that stores water, adapting it to its arid habitat. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. Heisteria amphoricarpa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
