    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. sempronianum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle morphological differences from the main species, including leaf shape and flower structure. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation."
