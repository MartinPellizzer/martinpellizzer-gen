    "intro": "Hypericum polyphyllum subsp. lycium, commonly known as the red-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reddish stems, opposite leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to native plant gardens. Its botanical features make it an important species for pollinators and ecological restoration projects."
