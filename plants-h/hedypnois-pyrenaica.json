    "intro": "Hedypnois pyrenaica, commonly known as the Pyrenean lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its crustose growth form, forming a thin, tightly adherent layer on rock surfaces. The thallus is typically pale grey to white, with a smooth or slightly cracked surface. It is widely distributed across the Pyrenees and other mountainous regions of Europe. This lichen is often found on siliceous substrates and is an indicator of clean, unpolluted environments."
