    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subrigidum, commonly known as the rigid shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, thick rhizome and closely spaced, linear leaflets. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate and finely textured foliage makes it a popular choice for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
