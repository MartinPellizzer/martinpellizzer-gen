    "intro": "Hymenophyllum jalapense, commonly known as the Jalapa fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the humid forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spores are released from small, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum jalapense is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
