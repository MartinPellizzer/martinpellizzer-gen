    "intro": "Hickelia africana, commonly known as the African hickory, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Hickelia africana is valued for its hard, durable wood and is used in traditional medicine and crafts."
