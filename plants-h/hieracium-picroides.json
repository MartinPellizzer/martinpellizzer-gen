    "intro": "Hieracium picroides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, consist of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Hieracium picroides is often found in temperate regions and can spread readily through its rhizomatous growth habit."
