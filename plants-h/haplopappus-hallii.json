    "intro": "Haplopappus hallii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant features basal rosettes of silvery-gray leaves, which help reduce water loss through transpiration. Its flowers are small, yellow, and typically appear in clusters, blooming from spring to summer. Haplopappus hallii is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited rainfall, making it a resilient species in harsh desert conditions."
