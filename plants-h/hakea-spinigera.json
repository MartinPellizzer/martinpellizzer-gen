    "intro": "Hakea spinigera, commonly known as the spiny hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, spiny foliage, which provide habitat for small animals and birds. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain edible seeds, which are a food source for various wildlife. Hakea spinigera is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
