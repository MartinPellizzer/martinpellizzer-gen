    "intro": "Hypochaeris radicata var. salina, commonly known as sea dandelion, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, while its stems are often prostrate. This variety is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and tolerate harsh coastal conditions."
