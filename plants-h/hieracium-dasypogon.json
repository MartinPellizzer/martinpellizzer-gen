    "intro": "Hieracium dasypogon, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium dasypogon is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
