It thrives in shallow, brackish or saltwater environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Halophila johnsonii is also important for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in marine ecosystems."
