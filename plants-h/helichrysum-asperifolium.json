    "intro": "Helichrysum asperifolium, commonly known as the rough-leaved everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature."
