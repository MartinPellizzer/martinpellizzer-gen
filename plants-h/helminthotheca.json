    "intro": "Helminthotheca, commonly known as the \"hairy weed\" or \"hedge mustard,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and hairy leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and gardens. Helminthotheca species are annual or biennial herbs that produce small, round pods containing seeds. These plants are often considered weeds but have been used in traditional medicine for their potential health benefits."
