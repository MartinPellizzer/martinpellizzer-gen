    "intro": "Holophyllum scabrum, commonly known as rough stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to arid and rocky environments in southern Africa. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces yellow or orange flowers during the summer months, which are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for rockeries and dryland landscaping."
