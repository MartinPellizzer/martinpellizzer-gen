    "intro": "Humulus lupulus var. pubescens, commonly known as pubescent hops, is a variant of the hop plant native to certain regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, pubescent leaves and cones, which differ from the more commonly cultivated varieties. The plant is typically grown for its female cones, which are used in brewing beer due to their aromatic resins and bitterness. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated edges and a climbing habit, supported by adventitious roots. This variety is less commercially widespread than other hop cultivars but is of interest in botanical studies and traditional herbal uses."
