    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. submacranthum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies distinction is based on subtle differences in flower structure and leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
