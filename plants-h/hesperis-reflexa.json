The plant is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately lobed, and the plant often grows in meadows and along roadsides. Hesperis reflexa is known for its pleasant, somewhat spicy fragrance, which attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
