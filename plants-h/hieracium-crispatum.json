    "intro": "Hieracium crispatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium crispatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It is considered a non-invasive species but can be persistent in certain environments."
