It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with white or cream markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the cooler months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
