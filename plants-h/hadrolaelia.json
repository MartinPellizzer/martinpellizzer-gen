    "intro": "Hadrolaelia, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. They are characterized by their striking, golden-yellow flowers that bloom during the warmer months. Hadrolaelia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to high-altitude environments and their role in the biodiversity of the Andean cloud forests."
