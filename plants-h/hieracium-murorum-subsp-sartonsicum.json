    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. sartonsicum, commonly known as the Sartons' hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head that produces yellowish or reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is found in meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its often arid habitat. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
