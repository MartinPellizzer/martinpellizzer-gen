    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. laetiviride, commonly known as the greenleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. The variety laetiviride is distinguished by its bright green foliage, which contrasts with the typical yellow-green of other hawkweed species."
