    "intro": "Hemitome ignea, commonly known as the fiery hemitome, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking red and orange tubular flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
