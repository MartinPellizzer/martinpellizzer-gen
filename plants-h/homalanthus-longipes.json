    "intro": "Homalanthus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed croton, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
