    "intro": "Hapalochilus microrhombos, commonly known as the small rhombus liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a flattened thallus with a dense arrangement of rhomboid-shaped cells, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a structure composed of specialized cells for absorption and photosynthesis. Hapalochilus microrhombos is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality and habitat conditions due to its sensitivity to environmental changes."
