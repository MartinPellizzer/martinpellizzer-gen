    "intro": "Hieracium notopastum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more lanceolate. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it can form dense colonies."
