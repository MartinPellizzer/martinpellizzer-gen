    "intro": "Hymenophyllum houstonii, commonly known as Houston's filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds, which are covered in a thin, membranous layer. Hymenophyllum houstonii is noted for its unique morphology and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
