    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. provinciale, commonly known as the provincial hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in racemes during the summer months. Its flowers are surrounded by specialized leaf-like structures called phyllaries, which are characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
