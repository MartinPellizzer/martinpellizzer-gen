    "intro": "Hieracium imbutum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium imbutum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
