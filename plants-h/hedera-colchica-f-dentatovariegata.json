    "intro": "Hedera colchica f. dentatovariegata, commonly known as the Variegated Colchic Hedera, is a cultivar of the common ivy. It is characterized by its striking variegated leaves with white and yellow margins, which contrast with its deep green center. Native to the Caucasus region, this plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It has a climbing habit and produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in the spring. The variegation is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in a unique leaf pattern."
