    "intro": "Heliophila cinerea, commonly known as silverweed, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Heliophila cinerea is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local insect populations."
