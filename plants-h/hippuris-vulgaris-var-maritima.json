    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris var. maritima, commonly known as sea maiden, is a perennial aquatic plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of lakes. The plant has elongated, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. It plays a role in stabilizing water margins and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates. Its ability to tolerate varying salinity levels makes it an important component of coastal wetland ecosystems."
