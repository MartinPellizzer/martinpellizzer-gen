    "intro": "Helleborus niger var. stenopetalus, commonly known as the narrow-petaled white hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, palmately lobed leaves and its striking, waxy white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The flowers have a distinctive narrow, elongated petal shape, which gives the plant its varietal name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in shade and well-drained soil. This variety is closely related to the common hellebore, Helleborus niger, but differs in its floral morphology."
