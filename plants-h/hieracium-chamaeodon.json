    "intro": "Hieracium chamaeodon, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium chamaeodon is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
