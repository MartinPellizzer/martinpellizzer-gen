    "intro": "Hydrotaenia lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water clover, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has slender, ribbon-like leaves that are arranged in a floating or submerged manner. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, often clustered in spikes, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hydrotaenia lobata plays a role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
