    "intro": "Hedysarum decumbens, commonly known as creeping vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the western United States. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Hedysarum decumbens is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
