    "intro": "Hymenochaeta preslii, commonly known as the Preslii bracket fungus, is a species of bracket fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that typically grow on decaying wood in moist, shaded environments. The cap is usually pale brown to yellowish, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. The spore-bearing surface, or hymenium, is located on the underside of the cap and is typically pale yellow to brown. This fungus is saprophytic, decomposing dead wood and playing a role in nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
