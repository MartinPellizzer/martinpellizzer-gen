    "intro": "Hydrocleys commersonii, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hydrocleys, is a tropical aquatic plant native to the Americas. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped or rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom above the water surface, often in late spring or early summer. Its roots are adapted for aquatic environments, anchoring it in shallow water or wetland soils. Hydrocleys commersonii plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for various aquatic organisms."
