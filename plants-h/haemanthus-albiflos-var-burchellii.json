    "intro": "Haemanthus albiflos var. burchellii, commonly known as the white-flowered haemanthus, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of sword-shaped, evergreen leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces tall, upright stems bearing clusters of white, star-shaped flowers in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably in suitable conditions."
