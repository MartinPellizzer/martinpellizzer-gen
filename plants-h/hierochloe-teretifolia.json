    "intro": "Hierochloe teretifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous areas. Hierochloe teretifolia produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is of interest to botanists studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
