    "intro": "Hieracium hypermorphum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and its stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine meadows. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in areas outside its native range."
