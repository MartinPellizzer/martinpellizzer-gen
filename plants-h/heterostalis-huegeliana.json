    "intro": "Heterostalis huegeliana, commonly known as the Huetzel's heterostalis, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often aromatic, a common trait among members of its family. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family. It is native to specific regions in Central America and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
