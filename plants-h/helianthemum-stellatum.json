    "intro": "Helianthemum stellatum, commonly known as the star cushion, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helianthemum stellatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
