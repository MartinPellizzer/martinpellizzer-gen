    "intro": "Henriquezia verticillata var. apiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed henriquezia, is a shrub native to the dry forests of Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
