    "intro": "Hebea angusta, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It features slender, upright stems covered in small, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, violet, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebea angusta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
