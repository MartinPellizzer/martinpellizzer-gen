    "intro": "Hakea tripartita, commonly known as the three-part hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers that appear in summer. The plant has woody, often spiny stems and narrow, linear leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair. Hakea tripartita is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects."
