    "intro": "Haworthia mutica, commonly known as the woolly Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically fleshy and bluish-green, adapted to store water in arid environments. It produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements and compact size."
