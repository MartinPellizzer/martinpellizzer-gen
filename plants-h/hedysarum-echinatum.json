    "intro": "Hedysarum echinatum, commonly known as the thorny vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive thorned stems. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Hedysarum echinatum is often found in dry, calcareous soils and can thrive in rocky or gravelly habitats. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
