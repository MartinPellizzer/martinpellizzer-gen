    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum subsp. teplitzense, commonly known as the Teplitzense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, hairy leaves and produces numerous small, disc-like flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
