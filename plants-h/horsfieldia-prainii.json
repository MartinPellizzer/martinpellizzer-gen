    "intro": "Horsfieldia prainii, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often have a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Horsfieldia prainii plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing nectar for pollinators."
