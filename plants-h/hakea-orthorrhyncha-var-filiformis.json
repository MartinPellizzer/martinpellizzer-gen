    "intro": "Hakea orthorrhyncha var. filiformis, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, cylindrical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established. The varietal form filiformis distinguishes it by its more elongated and slender foliage compared to the typical species."
