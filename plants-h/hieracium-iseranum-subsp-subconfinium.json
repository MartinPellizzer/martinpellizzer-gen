    "intro": "Hieracium iseranum subsp. subconfinium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in a disk-like structure surrounded by ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
