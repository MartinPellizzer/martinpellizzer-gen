    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata var. luisieri, commonly known as the Luisieri Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in fine, translucent tubercles that give the plant its characteristic textured appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
