It is a small, cushion-like moss that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in temperate regions. The plant is characterized by its yellowish-green foliage, which gives it its common name. Its structure consists of dense, interwoven stems and leaves that form a compact, mat-like growth. Hemionitis sulphurea plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
