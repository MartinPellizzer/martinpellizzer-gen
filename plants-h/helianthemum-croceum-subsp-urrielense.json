It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny areas. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to Mediterranean climates."
