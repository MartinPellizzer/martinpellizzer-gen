It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds."
