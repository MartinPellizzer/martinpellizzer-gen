    "intro": "Heracleum rigens, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, umbrella-like compound leaves and showy white flowers arranged in a spherical inflorescence. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
