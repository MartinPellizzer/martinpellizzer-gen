It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, with a fuzzy texture. This species thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
