    "intro": "Hybanthus atropurpureus f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy purple hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Violaceae and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant features small, tubular flowers that are typically purple or violet in color, with hairy foliage that gives it its specific epithet. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The hairy pubescence on its leaves and stems is a distinctive botanical trait that aids in moisture retention and protection from herbivores."
