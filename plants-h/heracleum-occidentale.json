    "intro": "Heracleum occidentale, commonly known as western cowparsley, is a biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to western North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as stream banks and roadsides. The plant has a tall, slender stem that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and it produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like clusters. Its leaves are pinnately divided with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family. It is important to note that while not toxic, some species in the genus can cause skin irritation."
