    "intro": "Habenaria praestans var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shadow orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces delicate, pendulous flowers with a pale greenish-white color and a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in the spring. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
