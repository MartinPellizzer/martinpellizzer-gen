    "intro": "Hieracium floccidorsum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are typically basal, with a soft, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. The plant is often found in sandy or calcareous soils and is known for its ornamental appearance."
