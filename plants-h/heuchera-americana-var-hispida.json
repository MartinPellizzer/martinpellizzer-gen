    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. hispida, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that ranges in color from silver to deep red, depending on the variety. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in the spring, which are borne on upright, branching stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground cover. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils in woodland gardens."
