    "intro": "Habenaria sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaio's orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are small, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, and are arranged in a loose spike. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
