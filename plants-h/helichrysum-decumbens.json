    "intro": "Helichrysum decumbens, commonly known as the prostrate immortelle, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a low-growing, sprawling habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, golden-yellow flower heads that are clustered in dense, compact inflorescences. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Helichrysum decumbens is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
