    "intro": "Hornungia revelierei subsp. sommieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre bellflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico. It is a perennial herb with distinctive bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
