    "intro": "Hypericum pinetorum, commonly known as the pine St. John's wort, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils in forested areas, often near pine trees. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in terminal racemes. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and oval-shaped with a slightly rough texture. Hypericum pinetorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its purported health benefits."
