    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. bridelianum, commonly known as the Bridel's hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has finely divided leaves and is known for its ability to spread via rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species by its specific leaf morphology and flowering pattern."
