    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudosaxigenum, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes or cliffs, and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its flowers are surrounded by a series of pale yellow ray florets, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
