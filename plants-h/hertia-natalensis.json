It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. Hertia natalensis is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
