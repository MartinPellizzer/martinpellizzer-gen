It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in open woodlands and prairies. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Helianthus sparsiflorus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
