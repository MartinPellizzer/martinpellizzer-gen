    "intro": "Hymenophyllum aculeatum, commonly known as the aculeate fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant has a unique structure with finely divided, often hair-like leaves that are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, and it produces spores rather than seeds."
