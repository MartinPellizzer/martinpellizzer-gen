    "intro": "Hydranthus scandens, commonly known as the climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing habit and large, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, white, sterile flowers surrounded by colorful, modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. The leaves are typically dark green and turn red or purple in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the garden."
