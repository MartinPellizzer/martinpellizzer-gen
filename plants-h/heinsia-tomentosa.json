    "intro": "Heinsia tomentosa, commonly known as the woolly heinsia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Heinsia tomentosa is often grown for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
