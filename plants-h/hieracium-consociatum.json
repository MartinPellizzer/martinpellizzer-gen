    "intro": "Hieracium consociatum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It features basal leaves that are often hairy and lance-shaped, with yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium consociatum is often found in colonies, which is reflected in its common name."
