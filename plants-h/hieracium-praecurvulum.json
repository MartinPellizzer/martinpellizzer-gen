    "intro": "Hieracium praecurvulum, commonly known as the bentleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are erect and can reach up to 60 cm in height. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
