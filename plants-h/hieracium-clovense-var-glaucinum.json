    "intro": "Hieracium clovense var. glaucinum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in the form of composite heads. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground. The varietal name 'glaucinum' refers to the bluish-gray hue of its foliage, which helps it reflect sunlight and reduce water loss."
