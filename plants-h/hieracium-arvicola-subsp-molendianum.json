It typically grows in rocky and grassy habitats at high altitudes. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
