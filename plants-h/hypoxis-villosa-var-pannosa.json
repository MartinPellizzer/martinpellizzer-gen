    "intro": "Hypoxis villosa var. pannosa, commonly known as the hairy yellow star, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves that are often tinged with reddish or purplish hues. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a star-like pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across regions with a Mediterranean climate."
