    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia f. interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted broad-leaf helleborine, is a hybrid orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces pale greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate pattern. This plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in shaded, moist woodland areas. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. The interrupted form refers to the irregular pattern of the leaf markings, which distinguishes it from other helleborine varieties."
