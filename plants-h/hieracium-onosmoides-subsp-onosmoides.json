    "intro": "Hieracium onosmoides subsp. onosmoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense colonies. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
