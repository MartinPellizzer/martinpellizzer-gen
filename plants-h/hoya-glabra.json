    "intro": "Hoya glabra, commonly known as the porcelain vine, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a trailing vine that produces clusters of waxy, white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant features thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Hoya glabra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
