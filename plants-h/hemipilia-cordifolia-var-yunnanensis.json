    "intro": "Hemipilia cordifolia var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan heartleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to China. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its growth is slow, and it requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
