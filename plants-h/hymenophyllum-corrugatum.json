    "intro": "Hymenophyllum corrugatum, commonly known as the zigzag fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have a zigzag appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Hymenophyllum corrugatum is noted for its intricate spore-producing structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of its fronds."
