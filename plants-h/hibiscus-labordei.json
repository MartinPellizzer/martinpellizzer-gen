It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet, featuring broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. The flowers are usually bright red or pink, with a yellow center, and bloom during the summer months. Hibiscus labordei is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight.
