    "intro": "Hedera helix subvar. prostrata, commonly known as the creeping ivy, is a vigorous, ground-covering plant native to Europe. It features dark green, slightly lobed leaves that are typically smaller than those of common ivy. This variety spreads horizontally via runners, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for erosion control. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking to cover soil or climb structures."
