    "intro": "Hieracium scheppigianum subsp. durmitoricum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowering heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils at high altitudes. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are grouped in clusters. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
