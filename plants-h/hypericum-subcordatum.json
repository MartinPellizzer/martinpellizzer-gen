    "intro": "Hypericum subcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, narrow, elliptic leaves. The plant produces small, yellow to orange-red flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable ornamental plant in gardens. Its medicinal properties have also been studied, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species."
