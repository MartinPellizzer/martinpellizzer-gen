    "intro": "Helichrysum abietifolium, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. The leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss."
