    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum subsp. immaculatum, commonly known as the white-stemmed St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense inflorescences. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts various pollinators. The species is characterized by its lack of glandular dots on the stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from other members of the Hypericum genus."
