    "intro": "Hieracium spelugense, commonly known as the cave hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to subterranean environments, particularly in caves and rock crevices. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and hairy, often pale green leaves. This species is adapted to low-light conditions and thrives in humid, shaded areas. Its growth is typically slow, and it forms dense mats on rocky surfaces. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered plant, often found in isolated cave systems."
