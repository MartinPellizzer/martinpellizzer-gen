    "intro": "Holcus contortus, commonly known as the twisted grass or narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often slightly twisted, giving it its common name. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive blue-green color. The inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets that are wind-pollinated."
