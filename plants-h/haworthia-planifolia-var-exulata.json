    "intro": "Haworthia planifolia var. exulata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, triangular leaves that are adorned with white to light green markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant typically produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
