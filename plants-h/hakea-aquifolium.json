    "intro": "Hakea aquifolium, commonly known as the silver hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that resembles the leaves of holly, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright red, urn-shaped flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems are covered in a thick layer of fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hakea aquifolium is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
