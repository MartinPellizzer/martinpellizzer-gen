    "intro": "Haworthia tortuosa var. curta, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings, which are more pronounced under direct sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
