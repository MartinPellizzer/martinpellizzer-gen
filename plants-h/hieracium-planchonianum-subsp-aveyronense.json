    "intro": "Hieracium planchonianum subsp. aveyronense, commonly known as the Aveyron hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the limestone regions of southern France. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, herbaceous stems that bear the flowering heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species."
