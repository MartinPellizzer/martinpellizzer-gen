    "intro": "Hymenasplenium ikenoi, commonly known as the Ikeno's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
