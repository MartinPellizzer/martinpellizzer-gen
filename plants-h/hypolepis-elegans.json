    "intro": "Hypolepis elegans, commonly known as the elegant water fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often glossy and dark green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forests. Its rhizomes grow horizontally, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Hypolepis elegans is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in water gardens and bog gardens."
