    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum var. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has evergreen foliage with narrow, leathery leaves that are adapted to rocky and arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
