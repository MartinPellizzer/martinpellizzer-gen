    "intro": "Hieracium niphanthodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium niphanthodes is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
