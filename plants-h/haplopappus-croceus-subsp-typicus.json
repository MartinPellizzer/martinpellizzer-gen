It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its reproduction. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in open grasslands and rocky soils. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
