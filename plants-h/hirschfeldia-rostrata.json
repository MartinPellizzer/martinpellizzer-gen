    "intro": "Hirschfeldia rostrata, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with slender, branching stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hirschfeldia rostrata is adapted to thrive in sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
