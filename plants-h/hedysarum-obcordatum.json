    "intro": "Hedysarum obcordatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its small, bean-like pods contain seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum obcordatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
