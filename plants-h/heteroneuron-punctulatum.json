    "intro": "Heteroneuron punctulatum, commonly known as the spotted liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its thalloid structure, which is typically flattened and ribbon-like, with a distinct central strand of cells. The plant exhibits a unique morphology with small, rounded lobes and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Heteroneuron punctulatum reproduces through spores, which are produced in cup-like structures called gametophores. Its distribution is primarily in temperate regions, where it thrives in rocky or soil-covered habitats."
