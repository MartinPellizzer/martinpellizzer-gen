    "intro": "Hieracium acuum, commonly known as the mouse-eared hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides and in meadows, and can thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering stems are usually unbranched and bear several flower heads. Hieracium acuum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
