It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. Its leaves are linear and smooth, while its seeds are small and hard, often dispersed by wind. Hordeum colchicum is an important plant in ecological studies due to its adaptability and role in soil stabilization."
