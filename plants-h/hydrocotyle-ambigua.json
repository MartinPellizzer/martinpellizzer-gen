    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ambigua, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, thriving in marshy areas and along stream banks. Its stems are often sprawling, and it produces a milky sap that is characteristic of the genus. Hydrocotyle ambigua plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
