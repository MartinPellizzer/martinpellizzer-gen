    "intro": "Hydriastele hombronii, commonly known as the Cape mountain fern, is a species of fern native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky outcrops and forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Hydriastele hombronii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
