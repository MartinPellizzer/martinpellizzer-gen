    "intro": "Helichrysum flavum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a unique, almost metallic appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to retain its color and form even when dried."
