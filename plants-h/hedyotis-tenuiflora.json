    "intro": "Hedyotis tenuiflora, commonly known as slenderflower or small-flowered bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or ascending, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hedyotis tenuiflora is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
