    "intro": "Heliotropium anomalum var. mediale, commonly known as the common heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit, often forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with hairy surfaces, and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of violet or pink. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are known for their ability to follow the sun, a trait called heliotropism. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
