    "intro": "Hypericum suberosum var. psilophytum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and is often found in rocky or well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in herbal medicine. However, it contains phototoxic compounds and should be handled with care."
