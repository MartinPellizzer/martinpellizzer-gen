    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. farinosum, commonly known as the farina hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
