    "intro": "Heliotropium ramosissimum, commonly known as the shrub heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and profuse display of small, violet or purple flowers. The plant features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, contributing to its rugged appearance. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense clusters at the ends of branches, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Heliotropium ramosissimum is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
