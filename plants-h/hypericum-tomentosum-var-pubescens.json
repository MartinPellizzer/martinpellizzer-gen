    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum var. pubescens, commonly known as the downy St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it its varietal name \"pubescens.\" It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
