    "intro": "Hydrocotyle spicata, commonly known as water pennywort, is a semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its leaves floating on the water surface or submerged. The plant has small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are rounded and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hydrocotyle spicata is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
