    "intro": "Hedypnois polymorpha var. crepidiformis, commonly known as the crested hedgehog cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a compact, rounded shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss in arid environments. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a hardy species for xerophytic gardens."
