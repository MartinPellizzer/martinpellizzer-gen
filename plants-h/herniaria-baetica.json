    "intro": "Herniaria baetica, commonly known as the Spanish sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Herniaria baetica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
