    "intro": "Hymenophyllum corticola, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique ability to grow on rock surfaces, where it absorbs moisture from the air and rain. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum corticola is often found in temperate regions, particularly in forests and on cliff faces."
