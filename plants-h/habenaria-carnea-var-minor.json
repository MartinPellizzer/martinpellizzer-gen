    "intro": "Habenaria carnea var. minor, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and long, spiraling inflorescences that bear small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it in the soil, while its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating. This orchid is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
