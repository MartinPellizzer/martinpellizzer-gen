It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a hardy addition to Mediterranean-style gardens."
