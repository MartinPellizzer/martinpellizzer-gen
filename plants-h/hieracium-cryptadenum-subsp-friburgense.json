    "intro": "Hieracium cryptadenum subsp. friburgense, commonly known as the Fribourg hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
