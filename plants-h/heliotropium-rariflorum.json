    "intro": "Heliotropium rariflorum, commonly known as the rareflower heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy flowers. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint vanilla-like scent. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
