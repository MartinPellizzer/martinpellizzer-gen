    "intro": "Holcus avenaceus var. nodosus, commonly known as the nodose bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or wet meadows. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are often borne in loose panicles. The varietal name \"nodosus\" refers to the presence of nodules on the stems, which may be related to symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
