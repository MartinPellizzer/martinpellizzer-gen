    "intro": "Helonias alpina, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats, often near streams or in marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant produces tall, slender stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. Its leaves are narrow and linear, arranged in a rosette at the base of the plant. Helonias alpina is characterized by its ability to survive in cold, high-altitude environments, making it a notable species in alpine ecosystems."
