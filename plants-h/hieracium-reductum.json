    "intro": "Hieracium reductum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. Hieracium reductum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in certain regions."
