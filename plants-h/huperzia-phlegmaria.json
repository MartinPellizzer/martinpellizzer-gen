    "intro": "Huperzia phlegmaria, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocky substrates in temperate regions. Its sporangia are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a feature typical of many ferns. Huperzia phlegmaria is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
