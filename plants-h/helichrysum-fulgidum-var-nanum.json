    "intro": "Helichrysum fulgidum var. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf golden everlasting, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to South Africa. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, giving it a striking, sun-like appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is often used in landscaping for its long-lasting flowers and ability to attract pollinators."
