    "intro": "Honckenya peploides subsp. diffusa, commonly known as the coastal beardgrass, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and coastal regions of the western United States. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by spikelets that disperse seeds by wind. Its root system is extensive and adapted to stabilize sandy or rocky soils. This subspecies is particularly resilient to salt spray and drought, making it a common pioneer species in coastal dunes."
