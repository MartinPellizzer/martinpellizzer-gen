    "intro": "Hemerocallis major, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a perennial flowering plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces bright yellow petals with a prominent orange throat, making it a striking addition to gardens. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Hemerocallis major is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, forming dense clumps over time."
