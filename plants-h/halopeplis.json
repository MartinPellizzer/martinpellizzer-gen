It is native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of Mexico, Central America, and parts of the southwestern United States. The plants are characterized by their spiny stems and showy, often brightly colored flowers. They are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. Halopeplis species can be either shrubs or small trees, and they play a role in local ecosystems by providing food and shelter for various wildlife."
