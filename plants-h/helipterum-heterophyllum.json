    "intro": "Helipterum heterophyllum, commonly known as the variable helipterum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small yellow flowers that are often surrounded by pale green or white ray florets. Helipterum heterophyllum is known for its variable morphology, which contributes to its common name."
