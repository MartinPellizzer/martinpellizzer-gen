    "intro": "Hieracium pseudartatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies. It has opposite leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium pseudartatum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
