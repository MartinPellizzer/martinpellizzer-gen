    "intro": "Hieracium sejunctum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems that are often hairy, and its basal leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
