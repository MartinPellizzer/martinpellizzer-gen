    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton var. subcrinitum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with a rough, hairy texture. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the genus Hieracium. The hairy texture of both leaves and stems is a distinguishing feature, contributing to its common name."
