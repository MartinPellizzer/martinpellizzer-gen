    "intro": "Hieracium informe, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium informe is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
