    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a herbaceous annual with yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sprawling growth habit and is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves. Its scientific name reflects the variability in its pubescence, with \"villosus\" referring to its dense, soft hairs. It is often found in disturbed soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
