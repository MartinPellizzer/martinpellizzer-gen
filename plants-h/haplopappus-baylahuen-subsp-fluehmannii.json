    "intro": "Haplopappus baylahuen subsp. fluehmannii, commonly known as the Andean pappus, is a flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or arid soils. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. The small, yellowish flowers are arranged in a dense cluster, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
