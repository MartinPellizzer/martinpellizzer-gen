    "intro": "Heisteria tessmanniana, commonly known as the dwarf heisteria, is a perennial flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticultural trade."
