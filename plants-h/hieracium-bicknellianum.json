    "intro": "Hieracium bicknellianum, commonly known as Bicknell's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the northeastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands. It has dark green, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers in the summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
