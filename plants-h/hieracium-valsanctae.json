    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium valsanctae, commonly known as the sacred valley hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
