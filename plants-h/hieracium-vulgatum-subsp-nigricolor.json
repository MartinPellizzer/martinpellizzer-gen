    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. nigricolor, commonly known as the black-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, often purplish, basal leaves and yellow flowering heads that consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker foliage and more compact growth habit compared to other hawkweed species."
