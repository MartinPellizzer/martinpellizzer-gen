    "intro": "Humboltia, commonly known as the hummingbird flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. It is native to South America, particularly the Andean region, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators like hummingbirds. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with leaves that are alternate and often lance-shaped. Humboltia species are known for their vibrant colors, ranging from red to orange, and their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
