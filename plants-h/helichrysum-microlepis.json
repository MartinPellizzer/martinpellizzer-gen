    "intro": "Helichrysum microlepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns, which are tightly packed into dense, spherical clusters. The plant produces fibrous roots and has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to retain color after drying makes it a favored plant for floral arrangements."
