    "intro": "Hemsleya panacis-scandens var. pingbianensis, commonly known as the Pingbian climbing hemsleya, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its climbing habit, with slender, twining stems that often ascend along supports. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, round berries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often studied for its potential ecological and medicinal significance."
