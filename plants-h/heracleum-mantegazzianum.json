    "intro": "Heracleum mantegazzianum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial herb native to the Caucasus region. It features large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and thick, hairy stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has deeply lobed, coarse leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. It is known for its toxic sap, which contains phototoxic chemicals that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many parts of the world."
