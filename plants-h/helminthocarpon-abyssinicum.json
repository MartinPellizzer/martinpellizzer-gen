It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, woody shrub form. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female structures, and it produces small, fleshy fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
