It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of white, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring before the leaves emerge. The leaves are simple, alternate, and oval-shaped with a smooth margin. The plant has a smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. It is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
