    "intro": "Heracleum olgae, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and large, coarse leaves. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
