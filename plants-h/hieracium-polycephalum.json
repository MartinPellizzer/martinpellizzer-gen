    "intro": "Hieracium polycephalum, commonly known as the many-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces numerous small yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat cluster, which gives it its common name. Hieracium polycephalum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
