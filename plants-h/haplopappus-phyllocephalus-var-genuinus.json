    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus var. genuinus, commonly known as the narrowleaf goatweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bract structures. The plant typically grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, with linear, often hairy leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss. Its small yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by papery, wind-dispersed seeds. This species is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides."
