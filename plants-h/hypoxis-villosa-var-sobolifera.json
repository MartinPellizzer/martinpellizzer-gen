    "intro": "Hypoxis villosa var. sobolifera, commonly known as the woolly yellowstar, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy, grass-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a star-like arrangement. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its striking color and unique floral structure."
