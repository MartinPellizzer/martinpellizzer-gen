It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal and sessile, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium semicymosum is often found in temperate regions and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
