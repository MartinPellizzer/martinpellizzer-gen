It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the summer months. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
