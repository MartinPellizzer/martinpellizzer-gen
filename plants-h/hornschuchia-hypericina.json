    "intro": "Hornschuchia hypericina, commonly known as the purple horned poppy, is a striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, horn-like structures that encase its flowers, giving it a unique and somewhat intimidating appearance. The plant produces vibrant purple to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its overall rugged look. Hornschuchia hypericina is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
