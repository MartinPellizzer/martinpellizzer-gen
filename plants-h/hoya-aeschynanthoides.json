    "intro": "Hoya aeschynanthoides, commonly known as the \"Snow Queen\" or \"White Lady,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of small, waxy, white flowers that resemble snowflakes. The plant produces showy, star-shaped blooms that are often fragrant and appear in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to lanceolate, with a glossy surface and a subtle veining pattern. Hoya aeschynanthoides thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
