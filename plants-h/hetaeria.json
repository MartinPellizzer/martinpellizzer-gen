    "intro": "Hetaeria, commonly known as the common hetaeria, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and finely divided leaves that resemble those of other members of the carrot family. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and are often white or pale yellow in color. Hetaeria species are typically found in moist, temperate environments, such as meadows and woodland edges. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their delicate foliage and flowering displays."
