    "intro": "Hosta fortunei f. viridis, commonly known as the Emerald Queen hosta, is a compact, hardy perennial that features broad, waxy, dark green leaves with a striking metallic sheen. This variegated form exhibits solid green foliage without the typical yellow or white markings found in other hosta varieties. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil rich in organic matter. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems in late summer. Its dense foliage makes it an excellent choice for ground cover or as a focal point in shaded garden settings."
