    "intro": "Heliophytum foetidum, commonly known as the stinking honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water, and the plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor. Heliophytum foetidum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
