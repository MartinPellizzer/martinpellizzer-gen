    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. erucibifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and often lobed, with a hairy surface. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
