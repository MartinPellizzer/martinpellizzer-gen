    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. berardianum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a prostrate or ascending stem with hairy leaves that are often clasping around the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite inflorescence, consisting of ray florets and disk florets. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats."
