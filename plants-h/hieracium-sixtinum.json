    "intro": "Hieracium sixtinum, commonly known as the Sixtine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium sixtinum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
