    "intro": "Helixanthera subalata, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Helixanthera subalata is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in garden settings."
