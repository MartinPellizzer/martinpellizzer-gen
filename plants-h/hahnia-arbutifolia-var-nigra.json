    "intro": "Hahnia arbutifolia var. nigra, commonly known as black hahnia, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, bark and small, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, edible berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its hardy nature and ornamental features make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
