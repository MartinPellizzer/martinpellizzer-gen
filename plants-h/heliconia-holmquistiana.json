    "intro": "Heliconia holmquistiana, commonly known as the Holmquist's heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant's inflorescence consists of a tall, spadix surrounded by a broad, leaf-like bract. Its leaves are typically large, broad, and have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in humid environments. Heliconia holmquistiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
