    "intro": "Henriettea cogniauxiana, commonly known as the Cogniaux's henriettea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many ornamental and economically important plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a slight purple tinge. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a smooth, glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea cogniauxiana is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
