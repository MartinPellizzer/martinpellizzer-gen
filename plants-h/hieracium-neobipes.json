    "intro": "Hieracium neobipes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium neobipes is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
