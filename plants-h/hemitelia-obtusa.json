    "intro": "Hemitelia obtusa, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the year in warm climates. Hemitelia obtusa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or near water bodies. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and conservation efforts in its native habitat."
