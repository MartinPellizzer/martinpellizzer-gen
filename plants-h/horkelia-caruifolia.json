    "intro": "Horkelia caruifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are characterized by a silvery-white coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Horkelia caruifolia is often found in open habitats such as meadows and slopes."
