The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It is a perennial herb that produces numerous small, herbaceous stems bearing clusters of tiny florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
