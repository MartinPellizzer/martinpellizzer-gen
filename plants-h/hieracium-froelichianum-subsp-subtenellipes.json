    "intro": "Hieracium froelichianum subsp. subtenellipes, commonly known as the slenderleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
