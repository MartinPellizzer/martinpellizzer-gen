    "intro": "Hieracium cottetii subsp. cottetii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It has a low-growing habit with a rosette of leaves and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
