    "intro": "Hosackia cuprea, commonly known as the redstem false brome, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, reddish-brown spikelets that are often clustered at the base of the stem. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a distinctive reddish tinge on the underside. Hosackia cuprea is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing food for native pollinators."
