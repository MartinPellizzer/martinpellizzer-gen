    "intro": "Hieracium leptodermum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
