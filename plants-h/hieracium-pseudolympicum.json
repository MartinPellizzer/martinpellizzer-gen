    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolympicum, commonly known as the false lyme hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has serrated, lance-shaped leaves and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, often becoming invasive. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
