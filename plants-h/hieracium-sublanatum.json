    "intro": "Hieracium sublanatum, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, grayish-green leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. Its flowers are typically yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped fruits called cypselae. Hieracium sublanatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can sometimes be invasive in certain regions."
