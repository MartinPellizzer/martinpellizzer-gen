    "intro": "Hilaria cenchroides var. longifolia, commonly known as desert threeawn, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and spikelets that are typically 3 to 5 mm in length. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which are adapted for survival in arid environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities for its purported healing properties."
