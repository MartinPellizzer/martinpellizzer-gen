    "intro": "Hieracium brachymeres, commonly known as the short-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has small, rough leaves that are often covered with fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is an annual or biennial herb that can spread through seeds and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
