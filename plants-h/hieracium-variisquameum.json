It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc and is known for its variable leaf shapes, which contribute to its common name. Hieracium variisquameum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
