    "intro": "Huperzia sodiroana, commonly known as the slender huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador. Huperzia sodiroana is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
