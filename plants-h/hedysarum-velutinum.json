    "intro": "Hedysarum velutinum, commonly known as the velvet vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Hedysarum velutinum is valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
