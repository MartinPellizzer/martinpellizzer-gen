    "intro": "Haworthia tessellata var. coriacea, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often covered in a waxy, translucent layer that helps reduce water loss. The leaves are typically adorned with distinct white or pale green markings, resembling a zebra's stripes, which give the plant its common name. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. This variety is prized for its compact size and unique appearance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
