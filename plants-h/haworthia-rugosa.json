It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating called farina. The leaves are typically green with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
