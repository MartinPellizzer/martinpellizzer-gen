It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, elongated fruits. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its subspecies designation reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in fruit structure."
