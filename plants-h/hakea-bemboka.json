    "intro": "Hakea bemboka, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has woody stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that reduce water loss, adapting it to its arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in heathlands and dry forests, thriving in well-drained soils. Hakea bemboka is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
