    "intro": "Helleboroides cilicicum, commonly known as the Cyprus hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, helmet-like shape. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and is often grown in controlled environments."
