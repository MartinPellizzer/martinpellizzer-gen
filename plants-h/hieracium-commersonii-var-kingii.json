It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing, mat-forming habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. This variant is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and floral structure compared to other members of the species."
