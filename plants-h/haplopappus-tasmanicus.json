    "intro": "Haplopappus tasmanicus, commonly known as the Tasmanian burrweed, is a low-growing, annual plant native to southern Australia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately. Its distinctive characteristic is the presence of bristly, persistent pappus structures on the seeds, which aid in wind dispersal. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native range."
