    "intro": "Hymenophyllum torquescens, commonly known as the twisted hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is known for its intricate, finely divided leaves. It produces spores on the underside of its fronds, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus. This species is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in humid, temperate regions."
