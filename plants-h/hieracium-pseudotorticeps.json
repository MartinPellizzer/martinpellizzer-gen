    "intro": "Hieracium pseudotorticeps, commonly known as the false torticep hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a single, terminal head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can compete with native flora in certain regions."
