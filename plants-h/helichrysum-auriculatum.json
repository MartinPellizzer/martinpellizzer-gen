    "intro": "Helichrysum auriculatum, commonly known as the golden oatbrush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features wiry, silver-gray stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscapes. The foliage and flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
