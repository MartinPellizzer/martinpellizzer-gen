    "intro": "Heliotropium longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often with a fragrant aroma. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in some regions."
