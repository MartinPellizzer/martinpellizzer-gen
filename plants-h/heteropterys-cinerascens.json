    "intro": "Heteropterys cinerascens, commonly known as the ash-leaf tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that resemble ash leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which attract pollinators such as birds and insects. Its bark is thick and fibrous, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The tree is also valued for its ornamental qualities and can grow up to 20 meters in height in its natural habitat."
