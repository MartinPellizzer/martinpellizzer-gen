    "intro": "Hieracium glabratum subsp. nudum, commonly known as the naked hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually glabrous, with a distinctive lobed shape, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf hairs and specific geographic distribution compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
