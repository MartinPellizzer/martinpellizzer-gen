    "intro": "Heliotropium vernicosum, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herb with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming throughout the summer months. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of tidal marshes. Due to its hardy nature and ability to tolerate salt spray, it plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems."
