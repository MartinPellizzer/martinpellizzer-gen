It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in the summer. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Helianthus calvus is often found in sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
