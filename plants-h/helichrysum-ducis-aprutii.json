    "intro": "Helichrysum ducis-aprutii, commonly known as the Tuscan everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a feathery appearance, often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum ducis-aprutii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
