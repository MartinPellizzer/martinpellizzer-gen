    "intro": "Hohenbergia distans, commonly known as the silver stripe bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, silvery-white pubescence. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, adding a dramatic visual contrast. Its foliage is thick and waxy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Hohenbergia distans is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings."
