It is characterized by its striking crimson to purple foliage, which is often variegated with green or white margins. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, orange, or yellow during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant leaves and long blooming period, which extend from June to August."
