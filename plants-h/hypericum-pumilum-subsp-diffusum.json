    "intro": "Hypericum pumilum subsp. diffusum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a reddish underside. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
