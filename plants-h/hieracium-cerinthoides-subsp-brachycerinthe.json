    "intro": "Hieracium cerinthoides subsp. brachycerinthe, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable environments."
