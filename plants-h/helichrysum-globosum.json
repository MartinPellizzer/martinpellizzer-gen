    "intro": "Helichrysum globosum, commonly known as the globe everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny globes. The plant produces papery, dry bracts that persist long after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and striking foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant."
