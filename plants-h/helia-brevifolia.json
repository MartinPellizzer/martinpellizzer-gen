    "intro": "Helia brevifolia, commonly known as the short-leaved helia, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length, giving it its species name \"brevifolia,\" which translates to \"short leaf.\" The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded forest understories. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
