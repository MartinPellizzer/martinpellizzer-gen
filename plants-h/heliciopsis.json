    "intro": "Heliciopsis, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like China, India, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling small raindrops, hence its common name. Heliciopsis species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with compound leaves and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates."
