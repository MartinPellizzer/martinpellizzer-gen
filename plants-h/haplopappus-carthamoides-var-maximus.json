    "intro": "Haplopappus carthamoides var. maximus, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing perennial with soft, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has spoon-shaped, silver-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its fruit is a small, dry achene with a pappus that aids in wind dispersal. It is often found in sandy soils and is considered a characteristic species of desert ecosystems."
