    "intro": "Haloragis tetragyna var. micrantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in whorls along the stem. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near water bodies and is adapted to coastal and wetland environments. Haloragis tetragyna var. micrantha plays a role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
