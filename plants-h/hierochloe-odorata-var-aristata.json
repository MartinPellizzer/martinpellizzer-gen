    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata var. aristata, commonly known as sweet vernalgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open fields, meadows, and along roadsides. This plant is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its use in native plant gardens."
