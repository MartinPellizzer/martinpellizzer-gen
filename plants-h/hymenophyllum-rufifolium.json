    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rufifolium, commonly known as the red-leaf hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, glossy, and often reddish-brown fronds that are densely packed and finely divided. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum rufifolium is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in greenhouse settings due to its specific environmental requirements."
