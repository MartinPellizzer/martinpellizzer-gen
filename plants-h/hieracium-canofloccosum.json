    "intro": "Hieracium canofloccosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
