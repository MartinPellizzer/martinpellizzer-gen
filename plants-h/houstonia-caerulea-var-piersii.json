    "intro": "Houstonia caerulea var. piersii, commonly known as the Piers' blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features delicate, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows in dense, low mats, often in moist, woodland habitats. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences, and it is closely related to other species in the genus Houstonia. The variety piersii is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and geographic distribution compared to the typical form."
