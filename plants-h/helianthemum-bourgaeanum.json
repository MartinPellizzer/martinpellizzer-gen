    "intro": "Helianthemum bourgaeanum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are evergreen, narrow, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum bourgaeanum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
