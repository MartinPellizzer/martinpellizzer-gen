It belongs to the family Hydrocharitaceae and is characterized by its submerged or floating aquatic growth habit. The plant features long, ribbon-like leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
