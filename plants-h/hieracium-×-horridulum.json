    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 horridulum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, often spiny stems and leaves, which contribute to its rugged appearance. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain environments."
