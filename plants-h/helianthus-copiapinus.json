    "intro": "Helianthus copiapinus, commonly known as the Copiap\u00f3 sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Chile. It is characterized by its tall, branching stem and large, yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant has adapted to survive in saline and drought-prone environments, featuring a deep root system and thick, waxy leaves. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity. The Copiap\u00f3 sunflower is also valued for its ornamental appeal and potential agricultural uses in semi-arid regions."
