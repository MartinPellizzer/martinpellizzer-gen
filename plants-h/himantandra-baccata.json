    "intro": "Himantandra baccata, commonly known as the red-flowered cycad, is a tropical plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves. The plant produces striking red, fleshy cones that are both ornamental and contain seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is often cultivated as a decorative specimen in botanical gardens and private collections."
