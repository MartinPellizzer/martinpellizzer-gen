    "intro": "Hieracium holostenophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by seeds that are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
