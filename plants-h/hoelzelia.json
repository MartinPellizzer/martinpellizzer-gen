    "intro": "Hoelzelia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. Hoelzelia species often have a rough, hairy texture on their stems and leaves, which contributes to their common name. They are sometimes cultivated for their ornamental value or used in traditional medicine."
