    "intro": "Heliotropium transalpinum var. arcanum, commonly known as the alpine heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the high mountain regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh alpine environment. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
