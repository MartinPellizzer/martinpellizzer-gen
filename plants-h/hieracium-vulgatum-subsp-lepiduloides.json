    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. lepiduloides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies distinction is based on differences in leaf morphology and hair density compared to other Hieracium species."
