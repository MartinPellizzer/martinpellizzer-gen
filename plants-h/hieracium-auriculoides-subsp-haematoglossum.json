    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. haematoglossum, commonly known as the blood-glossed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at elevations ranging from 1,000 to 2,500 meters. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with serrated margins, and its flowering stems bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive reddish tinge on the basal leaves, which gives it its common name."
