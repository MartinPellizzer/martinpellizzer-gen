It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows and grasslands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
