    "intro": "Hieracium stachydifolium, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, giving it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Hieracium stachydifolium is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
