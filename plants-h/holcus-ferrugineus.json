    "intro": "Holcus ferrugineus, commonly known as red hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense, wiry inflorescence that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a reddish tinge, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. Holcus ferrugineus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
