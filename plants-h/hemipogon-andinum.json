    "intro": "Hemipogon andinum, commonly known as the Andean lily, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Liliaceae and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming dense clumps that help it retain moisture. Hemipogon andinum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
