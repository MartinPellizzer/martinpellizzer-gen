    "intro": "Hakea aculeata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its woody stems are often armed with stiff, sharp spines, which serve as a defense mechanism. Hakea aculeata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
