    "intro": "Haworthia bayeri var. jadea, commonly known as the Jade Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves with a waxy coating and prominent white tubercles. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
