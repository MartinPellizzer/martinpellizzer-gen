    "intro": "Hieracium silenii, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium silenii is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
