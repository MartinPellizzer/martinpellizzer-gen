    "intro": "Handroanthus grandiflorus, commonly known as the yellow trumpet tree, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. The plant has a woody stem and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, especially hummingbirds, due to their bright color and nectar-rich structure."
