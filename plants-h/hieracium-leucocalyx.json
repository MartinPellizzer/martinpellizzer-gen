    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius leucocalyx, commonly known as the white-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal leaves that are usually oblanceolate or ovate, with a rough texture due to the presence of stiff hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow to orange, with white ray florets that give it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium leucocalyx is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
