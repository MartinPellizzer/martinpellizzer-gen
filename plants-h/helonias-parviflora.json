    "intro": "Helonias parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered helonias, is a herbaceous perennial native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in partially shaded to sunny conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces distinctive, elongated seed pods that split open to release its seeds. Helonias parviflora is often found in swampy areas and is valued for its ecological role in wetland habitats."
