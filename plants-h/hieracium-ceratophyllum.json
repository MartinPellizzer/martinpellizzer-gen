    "intro": "Hieracium ceratophyllum, commonly known as the horned hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, where it typically grows in meadows and grasslands. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, with yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It has small, spiny bracts that give it its common name, and it often forms dense colonies in its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
