    "intro": "Hetaeria cristata var. minor, commonly known as the lesser featherwing fern, is a delicate and rare species of fern native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, intricate fronds that resemble the structure of a feather, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically sensitive species."
