    "intro": "Hyparrhenia cornucopiae, commonly known as the horned bluestem, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, curved inflorescences that resemble horns, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, spikelet-like flowers. Hyparrhenia cornucopiae is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in degraded landscapes."
