    "intro": "Hieracium remotidens, commonly known as the remote-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a cluster of disk florets at the center of its composite flower head. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy and covered in fine pubescence. Hieracium remotidens is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
