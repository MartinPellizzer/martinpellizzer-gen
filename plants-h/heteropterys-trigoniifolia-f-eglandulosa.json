It is characterized by its distinctive, trifoliate leaves with glandular structures on the leaf surface. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within tropical and subtropical forests. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. The glandular features of its leaves may play a role in its ecological interactions and chemical composition."
