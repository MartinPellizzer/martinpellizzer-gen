It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The flowers bloom in clusters and are known for their vibrant colors, ranging from yellow to orange."
