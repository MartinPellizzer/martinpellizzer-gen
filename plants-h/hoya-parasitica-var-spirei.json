    "intro": "Hoya parasitica var. spirei, commonly known as the spiral hoya, is a rare and unique epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive spiraling growth pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming during the summer months. Its leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its natural habitat. Despite its beauty, it is a parasitic species, deriving some of its nutrients from host plants."
