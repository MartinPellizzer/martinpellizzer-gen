    "intro": "Hypochaeris arenaria var. integrifolia, commonly known as the sand dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and sandy environments. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with hairy stems and basal leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by distinctive seed heads. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and dunes. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it an important pioneer species in ecological succession."
