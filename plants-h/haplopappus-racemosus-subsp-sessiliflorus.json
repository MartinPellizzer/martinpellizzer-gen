    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is a small, annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces a compact cluster of small, bract-like structures at the top of the stem, which are characteristic of the genus Haplopappus. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is of interest to botanists studying xerophytic plants."
