It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
