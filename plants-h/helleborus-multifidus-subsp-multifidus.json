    "intro": "Helleborus multifidus subsp. multifidus, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the forests of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, palmately lobed leaves and its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant is known for its winter blooming habit, often flowering in late winter or early spring. It prefers cool, moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The plant is also noted for its toxicity, with all parts containing protoanemonin, which can cause irritation if ingested."
