It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow flowers in a dense cluster at the end of its stem. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the flowers are composed of several ray florets. This subspecies is part of the genus Hieracium, which includes many species of hawkweeds known for their showy, daisy-like flowers."
