    "intro": "Hoya weebella, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Hoya ivy,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, fleshy stems that can climb or trail, making it suitable for hanging baskets or shelves. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom throughout the year under proper care. Its leaves are broad, glossy, and often have a velvety texture. Hoya weebella thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
