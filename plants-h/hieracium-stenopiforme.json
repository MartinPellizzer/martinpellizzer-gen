    "intro": "Hieracium stenopiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium stenopiforme is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
