It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in white or grayish spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding ornamental value to its appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for succulent gardens and rockeries."
