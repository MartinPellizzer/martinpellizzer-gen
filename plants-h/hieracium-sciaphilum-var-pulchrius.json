    "intro": "Hieracium sciaphilum var. pulchrius, commonly known as the shade-loving hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in a clustered inflorescence. This variant is adapted to grow in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically pubescent, providing a protective layer against excessive moisture loss. The plant is often found in temperate regions and is considered a minor component of forest understory vegetation."
