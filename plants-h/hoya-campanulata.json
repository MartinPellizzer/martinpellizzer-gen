    "intro": "Hoya campanulata, commonly known as the bell hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of star-shaped, waxy white flowers. The plant produces its flowers in late spring to early summer, often in a bell-like shape, which gives it its common name. Hoya campanulata is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and attractive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot."
