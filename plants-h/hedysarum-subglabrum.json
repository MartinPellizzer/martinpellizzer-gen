    "intro": "Hedysarum subglabrum, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum subglabrum is adapted to rocky and arid environments, often growing in dry, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its use in erosion control and as a forage plant."
