    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. baliophyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in open, sunny environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
