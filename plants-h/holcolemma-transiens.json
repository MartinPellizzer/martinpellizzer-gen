    "intro": "Holcolemma transiens, commonly known as the wandering spider, is a species of venomous spider found in tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Theraphosidae and is characterized by its large, hairy body and prominent chelicerae. The plant-like appearance of its web and its nocturnal habits contribute to its misleading name. While not a plant, it is often mistaken for one due to its unique morphology. This spider is known for its potent venom, which can be dangerous to humans."
