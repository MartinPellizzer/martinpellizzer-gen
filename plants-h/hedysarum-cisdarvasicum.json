    "intro": "Hedysarum cisdarvasicum, commonly known as the Cisdarvasicum milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecosystem."
