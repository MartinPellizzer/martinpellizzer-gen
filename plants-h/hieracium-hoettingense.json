    "intro": "Hieracium hoettingense, commonly known as the Hoettingen hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Central Europe, it thrives in moist meadows and along stream banks. The plant is perennial and has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats. Its small, hairy seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
