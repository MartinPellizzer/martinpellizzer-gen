    "intro": "Hemionitis praetermissa, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, typically found in forest understories or rocky crevices. The plant has finely divided, delicate fronds that give it a ghostly appearance, hence its common name. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structures, including small, spore-bearing cones. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis praetermissa is considered endangered and is often difficult to cultivate outside its natural range."
