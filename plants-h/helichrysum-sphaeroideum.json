It is characterized by its spherical, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small globes, which are composed of numerous tiny, tubular flowers. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum sphaeroideum is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
