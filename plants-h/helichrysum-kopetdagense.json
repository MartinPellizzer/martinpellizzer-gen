    "intro": "Helichrysum kopetdagense, commonly known as the Kopetdag everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble small daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are usually linear and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its ability to conserve moisture. The flowers are long-lasting, which is why it is often used in dried floral arrangements."
