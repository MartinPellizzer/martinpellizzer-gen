It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
