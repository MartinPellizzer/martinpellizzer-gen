    "intro": "Hinterhubera, commonly known as the \"ghost fern,\" is a unique member of the Davalliaceae family, characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its fronds are typically bioluminescent, a rare trait that aids in nocturnal pollination. Hinterhubera exhibits a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi, which helps in nutrient absorption. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is often found in protected rainforest habitats."
