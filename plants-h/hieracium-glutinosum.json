    "intro": "Hieracium glutinosum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, sticky leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces a milky sap that is often sticky and can be irritating to the skin. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
