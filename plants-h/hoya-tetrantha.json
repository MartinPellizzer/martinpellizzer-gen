    "intro": "Hoya tetrantha, commonly known as the four-lobed waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and oval, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. Hoya tetrantha is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
