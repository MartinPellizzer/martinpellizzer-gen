    "intro": "Heuchera rubescens var. abramsii, commonly known as the Abrams' coral bells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, velvety foliage that ranges from deep red to bronze, with a subtle sheen that enhances its visual appeal. The plant produces upright spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to lavender, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in both its foliage and its delicate floral display."
