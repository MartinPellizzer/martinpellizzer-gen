    "intro": "Hebecoccus inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal hebecoccus, is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers, squash, and gourds. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, warm climates. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with opposite, palmately lobed leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellowish-green flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The fruit is a small, round berry that turns from green to red as it matures, making it an attractive ornamental plant."
