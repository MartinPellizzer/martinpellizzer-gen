It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of red or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
