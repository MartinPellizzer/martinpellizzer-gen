    "intro": "Haplopappus graveolens, commonly known as the sweet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is noted for its aromatic foliage, which emits a sweet, honey-like scent. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid environments. Haplopappus graveolens is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
