    "intro": "Hirschfeldia adpressa var. consobrina, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are often borne on short pedicels above the leaves. It is adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in areas with limited rainfall. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
