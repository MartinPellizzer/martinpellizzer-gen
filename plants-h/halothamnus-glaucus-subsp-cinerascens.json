    "intro": "Halothamnus glaucus subsp. cinerascens, commonly known as silver thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in dense, glandular hairs that help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, purple to pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered a hardy plant adapted to harsh, dry environments."
