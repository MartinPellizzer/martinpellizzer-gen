It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
