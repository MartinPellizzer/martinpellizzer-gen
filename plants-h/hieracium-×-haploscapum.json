    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 haploscapum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a taproot system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
