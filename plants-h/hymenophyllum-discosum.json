    "intro": "Hymenophyllum discosum, commonly known as the disc-shaped maidenhair fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, intricate fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum discosum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
