    "intro": "Hemionitis eatonii, commonly known as the mountain holly or rock holly, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often hairy leaves that are spirally arranged along its creeping rhizomes. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis eatonii is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
