It is characterized by its wiry, hairy stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature."
