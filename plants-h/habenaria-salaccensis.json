    "intro": "Habenaria salaccensis, commonly known as the Salacca orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, and it has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
