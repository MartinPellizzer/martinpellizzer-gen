    "intro": "Helianthemum asperum var. scariosum, commonly known as the rough rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine, glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
