    "intro": "Habenaria clarkei, commonly known as the Clarke's butterfly orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring or early summer, producing pale yellow to greenish-white petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
