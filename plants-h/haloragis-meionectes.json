It belongs to the family Haloragaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and stream margins, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Haloragis meionectes is an important component of New Zealand's native flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its wetland ecosystems."
