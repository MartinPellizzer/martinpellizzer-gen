    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium jurassiciforme subsp. intybellifolioides, commonly known as the Jurassic-forming hawkweed, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its robust, upright growth habit and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are broadly ovate with a waxy texture and a serrated margin, contributing to its unique appearance. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is adapted to calcareous soils. Its botanical significance lies in its historical classification and its role in understanding the evolutionary diversity within the Hieracium genus."
