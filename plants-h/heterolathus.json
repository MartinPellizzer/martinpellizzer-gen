    "intro": "Heterolathus, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to various regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and are known for their unique and intricate floral structures. The flowers of Heterolathus typically feature a specialized lip that resembles a spider, giving the genus its common name. They are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic, and often thrive in humid, shaded environments. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its distinctive and showy blooms."
