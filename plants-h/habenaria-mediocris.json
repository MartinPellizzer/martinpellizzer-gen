    "intro": "Habenaria mediocris, commonly known as the common marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and marsh habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, featuring a single, erect stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a raceme of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, which are often marked with darker veins. It blooms from June to August, relying on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. This species is adapted to moist, acidic soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground."
