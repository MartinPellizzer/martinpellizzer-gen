    "intro": "Heliconia tandayapensis, commonly known as the Tandayap\u00e9 heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, although they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Its robust, upright stems and broad, waxy leaves make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in warm climates. Heliconia tandayapensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various pollinators and tropical wildlife."
