    "intro": "Helictotrichon sempervirens var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades that are covered in a dense layer of hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and prairies. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in native plant landscapes."
