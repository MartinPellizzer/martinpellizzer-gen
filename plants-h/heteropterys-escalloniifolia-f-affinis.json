    "intro": "Heteropterys escalloniifolia f. affinis, commonly known as the affinis form of the Escalloniifolia species, is a tropical shrub native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants, and is characterized by its showy, palmate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. The affinis form is distinguished by slightly modified leaf shape and size compared to the typical variety."
