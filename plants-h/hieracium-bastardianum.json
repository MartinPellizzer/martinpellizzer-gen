It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
