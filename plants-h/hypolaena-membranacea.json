It is characterized by its large, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. The plant produces elegant, white flowers with a subtle fragrance, typically blooming in the evening. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
