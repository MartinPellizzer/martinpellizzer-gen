It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, hairy leaves and produces numerous small, herbaceous stems that bear the yellow flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
