It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its palmate leaves with three distinct lobes and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in moist, well-drained soils near water sources. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially grown."
