    "intro": "Hypericum lateriflorum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval, and slightly hairy, with a reddish underside. Hypericum lateriflorum is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
