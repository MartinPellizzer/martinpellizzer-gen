    "intro": "Hypolepis subantarctica, commonly known as the Antarctic fern, is a perennial fern native to the southern hemisphere. It is characterized by its delicate, bipinnate fronds that are typically less than 30 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in temperate rainforests and alpine regions. Its reproductive structures include sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This species is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and cool temperatures, making it a resilient plant in its native habitat."
