    "intro": "Herniaria boissieri subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers, typically in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it a hardy and resilient species. It is often found in rocky or sandy habitats, contributing to soil stabilization in its native environment."
