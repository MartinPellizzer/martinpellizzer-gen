    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. tredecimnervis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a whorl at the nodes along its stems. The leaves are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a smooth, waxy surface and a slightly serrated margin. This variant is distinguished by its 13-nerved leaf structure, which is a key identifying feature. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface."
