    "intro": "Huperzia trachyloma, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, leathery fronds that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky slopes. Its sporophylls are arranged in dense clusters, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Huperzia trachyloma is often found in temperate to subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ecological role."
