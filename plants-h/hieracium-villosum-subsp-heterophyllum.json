    "intro": "Hieracium villosum subsp. heterophyllum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
