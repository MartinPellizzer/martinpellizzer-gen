    "intro": "Honckenya diffusa, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh, cold environments. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine tundra habitats. Honckenya diffusa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
