It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy white flowers that resemble torches, giving it its common name. The plant belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes ginger and turmeric, and is known for its aromatic foliage and floral displays. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower due to its long-lasting blooms."
