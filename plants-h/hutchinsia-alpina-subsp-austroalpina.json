    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina subsp. austroalpina, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous environments. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pale blue flowers during the summer months. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh weather conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
