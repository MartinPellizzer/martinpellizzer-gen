    "intro": "Hieracium humile subsp. lacerum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of bright yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, linear leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its subspecies classification reflects subtle differences in leaf structure and flower morphology compared to other hawkweed species."
