It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are often hidden among its broad, strap-like leaves. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is typically found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological studies."
