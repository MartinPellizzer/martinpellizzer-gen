    "intro": "Hoffmannia asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf hoffmannia, is a perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its gray-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hoffmannia asperula is adapted to poor soils and can thrive in full sun, making it a resilient choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
