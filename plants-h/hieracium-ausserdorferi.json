    "intro": "Hieracium ausserdorferi, commonly known as the Outerdorf's hawkweed, is a flowering plant species native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
