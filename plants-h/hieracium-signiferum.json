    "intro": "Hieracium signiferum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium signiferum is often found in moist environments and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
