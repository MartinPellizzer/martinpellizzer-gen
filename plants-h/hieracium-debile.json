    "intro": "Hieracium debile, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically features dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting local plant communities."
