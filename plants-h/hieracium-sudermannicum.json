    "intro": "Hieracium sudermannicum, commonly known as the Sudermann's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in a single inflorescence. Native to Central Europe, this perennial herb thrives in moist, meadow-like habitats. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, tubular flowers that attract various pollinators. It is often found in open areas with well-drained soil, and it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
