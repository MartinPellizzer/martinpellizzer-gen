    "intro": "Halfordia scleroxyla, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic wood that is highly valued for its durability and rich reddish color. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a glossy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as endangered in many parts of its natural habitat."
