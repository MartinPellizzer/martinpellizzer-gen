    "intro": "Hibiscus gossypinus, commonly known as the cottonleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, particularly South Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Hibiscus gossypinus thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce numerous blooms throughout the growing season."
