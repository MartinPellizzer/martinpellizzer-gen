    "intro": "Hieracium explanatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad and often have a slightly hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and daisy-like. Hieracium explanatifolium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
