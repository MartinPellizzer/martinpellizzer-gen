    "intro": "Hieracium euchaetium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
