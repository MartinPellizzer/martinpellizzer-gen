    "intro": "Hieracium dentulum, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium dentulum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
