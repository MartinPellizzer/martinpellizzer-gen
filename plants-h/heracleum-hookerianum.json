    "intro": "Heracleum hookerianum, commonly known as Hooker's cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with distinctive, broadly ovate leaves that have a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces oval, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The species is notable for its potential toxicity, with some parts containing furanocoumarins that can cause photodermatitis upon skin contact."
