    "intro": "Heliophila circaeoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf waterplantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often slightly hairy, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes. It is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. Heliophila circaeoides is also a food source for various insects and aquatic invertebrates."
