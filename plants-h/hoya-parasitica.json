    "intro": "Hoya parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic hoya, is a unique flowering plant that exhibits hemiparasitic behavior, meaning it partially depends on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is native to regions of Southeast Asia, including parts of India and Malaysia. The plant produces attractive, waxy flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, often in shades of pink or white. Its leaves are simple and ovate, with a smooth surface and a tendency to curl when dry. Hoya parasitica is often found growing on the stems of other plants, such as fig trees, where it attaches itself using specialized root structures called haustoria."
