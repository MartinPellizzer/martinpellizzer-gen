    "intro": "Huttia, commonly known as the \"hutia\" or \"hutia plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae, which includes palms. It consists of only one species, Huttia celsii, native to the Caribbean islands of Cuba and Hispaniola. The plant is a small, tree-like palm with a slender trunk and pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it produces edible, fleshy fruits that are consumed by local wildlife. Huttia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in the ecological systems of its native habitat."
