    "intro": "Habenaria helodes, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces tall, slender stems that bear several lance-shaped leaves. The plant is notable for its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence that gives it its common name. Its flowers are typically greenish-yellow with purple or brown markings, and they are arranged in a helical pattern around the stem. Habenaria helodes is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and grasslands."
