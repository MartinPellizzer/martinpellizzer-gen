    "intro": "Hieracium sulphureum subsp. samoviae, commonly known as the sulphur hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
