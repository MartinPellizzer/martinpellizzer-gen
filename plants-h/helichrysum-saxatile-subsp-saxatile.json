It features small, yellow-orange flowers that are often retained on the plant long after blooming, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has a compact growth habit with silver-gray foliage that is drought-tolerant and sun-loving. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
