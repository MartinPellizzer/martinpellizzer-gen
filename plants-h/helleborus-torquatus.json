    "intro": "Helleborus torquatus, commonly known as the twisted hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are clustered in umbels and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Helleborus torquatus is known for its toxic properties, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful if ingested."
