    "intro": "Hemiboea follicularis var. follicularis, commonly known as the rock melon or rock fig, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, fleshy, red or orange fruits that are edible and have a sweet, melon-like flavor. Its leaves are succulent, thick, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, dry conditions."
