    "intro": "Hieracium languidulum, commonly known as the languid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its delicate, daisy-like appearance. It is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings but is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
