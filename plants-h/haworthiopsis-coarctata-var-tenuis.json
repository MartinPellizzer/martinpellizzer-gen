It features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with distinct white or pale markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
