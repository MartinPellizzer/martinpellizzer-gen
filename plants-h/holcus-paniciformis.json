    "intro": "Holcus paniciformis, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Holcus paniciformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and erosion control."
