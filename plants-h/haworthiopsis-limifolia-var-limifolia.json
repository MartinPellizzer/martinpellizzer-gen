It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its compact size and unique appearance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
