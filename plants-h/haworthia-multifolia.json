    "intro": "Haworthia multifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a small, succulent perennial native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white or pink flowers on slender stems during the growing season. Haworthia multifolia is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its unique appearance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
