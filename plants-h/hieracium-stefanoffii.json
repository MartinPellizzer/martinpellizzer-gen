It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
