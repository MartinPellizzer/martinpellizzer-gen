    "intro": "Haplopteris stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperborean, is a fern native to the southern hemisphere, particularly found in regions of South America and New Zealand. It is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky outcrops. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many ferns. Haplopteris stenophylla is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
