It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, narrow flower heads and longer bracts compared to other hawkweed species.
