    "intro": "Hypoxis hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy yellow star, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in a star-like cluster, which are typically borne on long, slender stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Hypoxis hirsuta is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
