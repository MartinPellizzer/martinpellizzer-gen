    "intro": "Hedysarum spinosissimum f. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous thorny vetch, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, calcareous soils. This variety is notable for its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
