    "intro": "Helianthemum estevei subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is well adapted to full sun. This subspecies is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
