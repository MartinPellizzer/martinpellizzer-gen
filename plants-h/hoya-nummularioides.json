    "intro": "Hoya nummularioides, commonly known as the \"coin plant,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya nummularioides is prized for its low maintenance and attractive foliage, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
