    "intro": "Hemizonia, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"Mexican sunflower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly Mexico and the southern United States, and are characterized by their distinctive, elongated seed pods. Hemizonia species typically have small, yellow or orange flowers arranged in a cluster, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are usually alternate and have a rough, hairy texture, while the stems are often hairy as well. These plants are often grown as ornamental plants due to their vibrant flowers and unique seed structures."
