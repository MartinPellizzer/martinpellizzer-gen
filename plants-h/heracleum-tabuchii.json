    "intro": "Heracleum tabuchii, commonly known as the Japanese cow parsnip, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and showy umbellate flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with a thick, hollow stem that is often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are white to pale green and bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. The plant is also known for its strong, sometimes toxic scent, which can be a defense mechanism against herbivores."
