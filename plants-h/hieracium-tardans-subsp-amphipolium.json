    "intro": "Hieracium tardans subsp. amphipolium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has a mat-forming growth habit and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
