    "intro": "Herschelia bachmanniana, commonly known as the Bachmann's hercules, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, humid climates. Its leaves are opposite and elliptical, often with a glossy surface, while its flowers are usually bright red or orange, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
