    "intro": "Hofmeisteria viscosa, commonly known as the sticky hofmeisteria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky and sandy soils. The plant is characterized by its glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is thought to deter herbivores. It produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, and its fruit is a capsule that releases seeds when mature. Hofmeisteria viscosa is often found in shrubland and fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
