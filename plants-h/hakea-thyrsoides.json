    "intro": "Hakea thyrsoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and striking, cone-shaped flower spikes that appear in late summer. The plant is adapted to coastal environments, with salt-tolerant properties and a deep root system that helps it withstand harsh conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or red, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea thyrsoides is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
