It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters and features hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy blue to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its flowers are tubular with five lobes and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Hallia hirta thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
