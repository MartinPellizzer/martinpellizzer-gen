    "intro": "Hieracium hypeuryum subsp. lamprocomum, commonly known as the silver-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, hairy leaves and flowering heads that consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Native to Europe, this perennial herb thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are covered in dense, glandular hairs that give them a silvery appearance, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural settings."
