    "intro": "Haniffia santubongensis, commonly known as the Santubong mountain fern, is a rare plant endemic to the Santubong region of Malaysia. It is a member of the Polypodiaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, strap-like fronds that grow in a dense, clustered formation. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in primary rainforests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
