    "intro": "Heteranthocidium gaviotaense, commonly known as the Gaviota mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the coastline, where it thrives in coastal climates with moderate rainfall. Its flowers are usually white or pale blue, and it produces small, bract-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Heteranthocidium gaviotaense is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
