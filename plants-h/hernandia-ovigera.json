    "intro": "Hernandia ovigera, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thick, woody roots that form a dense network underwater, aiding in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hernandia ovigera plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
