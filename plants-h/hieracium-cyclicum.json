    "intro": "Hieracium cyclicum, commonly known as the cyclic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in summer. Hieracium cyclicum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
