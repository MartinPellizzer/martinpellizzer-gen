    "intro": "Heterospathe sensisi, commonly known as the sensitive fern, is a unique plant belonging to the family Onocleaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are highly sensitive to touch, curling when disturbed. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in wetlands. Its reproductive structures, called sporangia, are clustered in a distinctive umbrella-like shape on the underside of the fronds. Heterospathe sensisi plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
