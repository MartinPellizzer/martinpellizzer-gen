    "intro": "Hieracium sagittatum subsp. sarcophylloides, commonly known as the arrowhead hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. The plant features basal and erect stems with alternate, heart-shaped to arrowhead-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more leathery leaves compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
