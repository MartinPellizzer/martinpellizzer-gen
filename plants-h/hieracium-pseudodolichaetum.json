    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodolichaetum, commonly known as the false woolly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. It has hairy, elongated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
