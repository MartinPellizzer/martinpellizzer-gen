    "intro": "Hypopitys stricta, commonly known as the dwarf larch, is a small coniferous tree native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and its unique ability to shed its needles annually, similar to deciduous trees. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in spirals along the stems. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hypopitys stricta is adapted to harsh alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure."
