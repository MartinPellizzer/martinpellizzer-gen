It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and is known for its striking, bell-shaped flowers. The plants typically grow from bulbs and produce showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and red. Hesperantha species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and as cut flowers. They thrive in well-drained soil and require full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
