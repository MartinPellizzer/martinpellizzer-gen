    "intro": "Hetaeria rhombipetala, commonly known as the rhombic petal orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, rhombus-shaped petals and a slender, erect stem that supports its showy inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer, are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hetaeria rhombipetala is considered endangered and is protected in several countries."
