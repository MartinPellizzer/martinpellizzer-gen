    "intro": "Hopea fluvialis, commonly known as the river hopea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, glossy leaves. The tree produces small, pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in catkins, and it relies on wind pollination. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release tiny, winged seeds. Hopea fluvialis is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
