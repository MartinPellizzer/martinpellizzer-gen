    "intro": "Helianthus strumosus subsp. tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and its role in supporting pollinators."
