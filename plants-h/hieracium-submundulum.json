    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion submundulum, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its small size and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
