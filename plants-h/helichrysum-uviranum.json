It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, sun-like flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its small, narrow leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum uviranum is valued for its ornamental use and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
