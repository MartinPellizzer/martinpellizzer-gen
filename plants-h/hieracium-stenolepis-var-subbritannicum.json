    "intro": "Hieracium stenolepis var. subbritannicum, commonly known as the British spear thistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. This variant is distinguished by its narrower leaves and slightly different growth habit compared to the typical form of H. stenolepis."
