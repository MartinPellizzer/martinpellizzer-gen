    "intro": "Hosackia stipularis, commonly known as the narrowleaf milkvetch, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, compound leaves with a stipular structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Hosackia stipularis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife."
