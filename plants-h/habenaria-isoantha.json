    "intro": "Habenaria isoantha, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil efficiently. Habenaria isoantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
