It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has narrow, linear leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
