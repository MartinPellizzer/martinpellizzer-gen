    "intro": "Hamamelis virginiana f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf witch hazel, is a variant of the common witch hazel native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its smaller, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form, which are usually glossy and dark green. The plant produces fragrant yellow-orange flowers in late autumn, which are clustered in racemes. These flowers are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits that split to release seeds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
