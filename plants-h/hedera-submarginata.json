    "intro": "Hedera submarginata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often variegated with white or yellow margins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera submarginata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on walls, trees, and in woodland areas. Its rapid growth and hardy nature make it both a popular ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
