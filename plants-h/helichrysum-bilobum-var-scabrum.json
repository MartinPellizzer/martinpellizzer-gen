    "intro": "Helichrysum bilobum var. scabrum, commonly known as the rough everlasting or scabrous everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its leaves are typically gray-green and have a rough, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
