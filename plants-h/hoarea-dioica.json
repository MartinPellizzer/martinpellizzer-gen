    "intro": "Hoarea dioica, commonly known as wild betony, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features square, branching stems and opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, producing small, purple or blue-violet blossoms. Hoarea dioica is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its calming and anti-inflammatory effects."
