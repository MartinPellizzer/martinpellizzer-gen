It is characterized by its heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, pale greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by egg-shaped, woody fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The species is notable for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed habitats."
