    "intro": "Hernandia nymphaeifolia, commonly known as the water lily fern, is a tropical plant native to regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, heart-shaped leaves that resemble those of a water lily. The plant typically grows in wet or aquatic environments, such as marshes and riverbanks. Its leaves are often floating or semi-submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or yellow in color."
