It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows on rock surfaces or in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous areas. Its fronds are usually short and clustered, with a soft, velvety texture. Hymenophyllum copelandii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
