    "intro": "Hieracium lembifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has finely divided leaves and is often found in moist or calcareous habitats. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
