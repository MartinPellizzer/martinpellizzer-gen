    "intro": "Humboltia brevipes, commonly known as the short-footed humboldtia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Humboltia brevipes is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
