    "intro": "Hypoestes flavescens, commonly known as the \"Magic Ruby\" or \"Rainbow Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink, contrasting with its vibrant foliage. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hypoestes flavescens is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
