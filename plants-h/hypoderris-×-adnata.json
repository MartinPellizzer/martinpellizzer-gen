It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hypoderris hirsuta and Hypoderris adnata, both belonging to the Moraceae family. The plant is characterized by its dense, glossy foliage and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, inedible fruits that are not typically consumed by humans. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
