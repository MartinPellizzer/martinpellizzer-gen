    "intro": "Hierochloe angusta, commonly known as narrowleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in cold, moist environments. It plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh habitats. Due to its resilience, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude and polar regions."
