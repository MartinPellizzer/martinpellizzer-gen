It is characterized by its striking pink and white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces showy, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
