    "intro": "Hydrobryum mandaengense, commonly known as the Mandaeng marsh plant, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetland environments, particularly in shallow, freshwater habitats with soft, muddy substrates. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted for life in waterlogged conditions. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, typical of many ferns, and it relies on spore dispersal for propagation. Due to habitat loss and environmental degradation, it is considered endangered in its native range."
