    "intro": "Haloragis tenella, commonly known as the slender willow herb, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or pale green flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions. Haloragis tenella plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
