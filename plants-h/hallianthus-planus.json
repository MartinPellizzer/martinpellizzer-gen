    "intro": "Hallianthus planus, commonly known as the flatleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of central Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers with a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
