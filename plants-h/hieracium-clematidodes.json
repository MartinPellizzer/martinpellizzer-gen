    "intro": "Hieracium clematidodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium clematidodes is known for its creeping growth habit and ability to form dense mats, which can sometimes make it invasive in certain regions."
