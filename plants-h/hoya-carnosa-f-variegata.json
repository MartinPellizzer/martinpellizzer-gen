    "intro": "Hoya carnosa f. variegata, commonly known as the variegated wax plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually pink or white in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya carnosa f. variegata is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
