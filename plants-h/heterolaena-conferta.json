    "intro": "Heterolaena conferta, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a small to medium-sized shrub or tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant typically has small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Heterolaena conferta is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
