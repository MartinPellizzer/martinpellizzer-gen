    "intro": "Hedysarum obscurum var. lasiocarpum, commonly known as the woolly fruit hedysarum, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. Its fruit is a legume pod that is covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, contributing to its common name. This species is often found in dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia."
