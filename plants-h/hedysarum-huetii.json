    "intro": "Hedysarum huetii, commonly known as the Huet's vetch, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open woodlands or along riverbanks. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in racemes. Its compound leaves consist of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it is known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum huetii is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and adaptability."
