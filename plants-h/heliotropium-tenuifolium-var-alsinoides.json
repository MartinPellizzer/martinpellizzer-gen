    "intro": "Heliotropium tenuifolium var. alsinoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its flowers, which are usually pink or purple, bloom in the morning and close by midday, a behavior known as heliotropism. This species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
