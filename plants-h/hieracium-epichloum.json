    "intro": "Hieracium epichloum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium epichloum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
