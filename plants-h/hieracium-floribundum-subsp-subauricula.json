It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the subspecies is distinguished by its auriculate (ear-like) base on the lower leaves. It is a non-invasive plant that plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
