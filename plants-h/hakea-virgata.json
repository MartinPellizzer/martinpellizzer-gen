It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces cylindrical, red or yellow flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Hakea virgata is known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments. Its unique appearance and resilience make it a popular choice for native gardens and ecological restoration projects."
