    "intro": "Hypoderris stubelii, commonly known as the Cape mountain heath, is a small shrub native to the fynbos biome of South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of the region. It has small, leathery leaves that help reduce water loss, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Hypoderris stubelii is often found in coastal and mountainous areas, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the fynbos ecosystem."
