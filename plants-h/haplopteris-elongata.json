    "intro": "Haplopteris elongata, commonly known as the elongated huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, creeping rhizome and small, ovate to lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the abaxial surface of the fronds, which are clustered in strobila-like structures. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Haplopteris elongata is a perennial plant that exhibits a unique morphology adapted to its specific ecological niche."
