    "intro": "Heliomeris multiflora var. multiflora, commonly known as the desert honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds and other nectar-feeding insects, and the plant is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping."
