    "intro": "Hypoporum, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow, buttercup-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Hypoporum thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species."
