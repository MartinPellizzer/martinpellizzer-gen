    "intro": "Hypecoum nodosum, commonly known as the nodding hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, globose berries that mature to a deep red or black color, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Hypecoum nodosum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or woodland settings. It is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in handling."
