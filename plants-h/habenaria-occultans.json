    "intro": "Habenaria occultans, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, leafless stems and striking, pale green to white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows on tree roots or in shaded, humid environments, relying on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often pollinated by specific insects, contributing to its limited distribution and conservation status. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
