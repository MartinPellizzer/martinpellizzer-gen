    "intro": "Helianthemum formosum, commonly known as the beautiful rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of yellow and orange, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in arid environments. Helianthemum formosum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
