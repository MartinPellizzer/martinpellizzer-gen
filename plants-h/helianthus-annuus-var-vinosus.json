It produces large, bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, dark orange to reddish brown florets. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking color contrast. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, similar to other sunflower species. The plant is native to North America and is part of the Asteraceae family, sharing botanical features with other sunflowers and daisies."
