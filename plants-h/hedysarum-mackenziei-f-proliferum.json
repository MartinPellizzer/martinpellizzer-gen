The plant produces trifoliate leaves and has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas. This variety is notable for its ability to propagate through both seeds and vegetative means, enhancing its resilience in challenging environments."
