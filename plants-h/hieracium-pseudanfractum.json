It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium pseudanfractum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
