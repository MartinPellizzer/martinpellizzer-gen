    "intro": "Haplopappus grindelioides, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with a low, spreading growth habit, characterized by fleshy, woolly stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its seeds are enclosed in a pappus, a structure that aids in wind dispersal. Haplopappus grindelioides is adapted to thrive in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
