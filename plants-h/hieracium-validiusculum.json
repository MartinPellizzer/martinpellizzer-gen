    "intro": "Hieracium validiusculum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium validiusculum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
