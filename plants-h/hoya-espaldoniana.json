    "intro": "Hoya espaldoniana, commonly known as the Espaldoniana Wanda, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing vine characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya espaldoniana is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
