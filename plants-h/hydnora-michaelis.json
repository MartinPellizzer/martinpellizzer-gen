    "intro": "Hydnora michaelis, commonly known as the desert candle, is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. It is found in arid regions of southern Africa, particularly in the Karoo and Succulent Karoo biomes. The plant produces a unique, fleshy, red or orange-colored flower that resembles a candle, hence its common name. It relies entirely on its host plants for nutrients and water. Its flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract pollinators like flies and beetles."
