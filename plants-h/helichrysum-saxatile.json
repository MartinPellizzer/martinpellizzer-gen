It is characterized by its compact, low-growing form and its dense clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, resembling miniature flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
