    "intro": "Heracleum tuberosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe and Asia. It features a stout, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs. The plant has large, umbrella-shaped leaves with lobed edges and small, greenish-yellow flowers that appear in clusters. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which contribute to its classification as a tuberous plant. Cow parsnip is known for its strong, aromatic scent and is often found in moist, open habitats."
