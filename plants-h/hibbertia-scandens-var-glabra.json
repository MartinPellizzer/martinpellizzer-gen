It features slender, twining stems that allow it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five pointed petals, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine, soft hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stem compared to other varieties in the species."
