    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. atrihaegerstroemii, commonly known as the black-haegerstroem hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to orange-red flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark purple or blackish stem and leaves, which set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus. It typically thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized plant in its native range."
