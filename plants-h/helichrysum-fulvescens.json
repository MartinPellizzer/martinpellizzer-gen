    "intro": "Helichrysum fulvescens, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant has wiry, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helichrysum fulvescens is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of natural dyes."
