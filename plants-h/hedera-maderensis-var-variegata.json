    "intro": "Hedera maderensis var. variegata, commonly known as the Mader\u2019s ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with striking white and yellow variegation, which adds visual interest to gardens. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shady garden areas or as a climbing plant on walls and trellises. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to tolerate a variety of growing conditions."
