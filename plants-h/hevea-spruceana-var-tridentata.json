    "intro": "Hevea spruceana var. tridentata, commonly known as the tridentate rubber tree, is a species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often tridentate, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species. It typically grows as an understory plant in humid, shaded environments. Its botanical features make it an important subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
