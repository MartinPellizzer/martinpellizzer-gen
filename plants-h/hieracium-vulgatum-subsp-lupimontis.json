It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, surrounded by a dense ring of phyllaries. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific adaptations to high-altitude environments."
