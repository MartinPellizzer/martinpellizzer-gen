    "intro": "Hymenorebutia pusilla, commonly known as the miniature pincushion cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to Argentina. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale yellow spines. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil. Due to its small size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
