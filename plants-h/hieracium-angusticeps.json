    "intro": "Hieracium angusticeps, commonly known as narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it has a creeping root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Hieracium angusticeps is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
