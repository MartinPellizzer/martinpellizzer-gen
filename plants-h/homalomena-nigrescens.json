    "intro": "Homalomena nigrescens, commonly known as the black nightshade fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that often have a velvety texture. The plant produces striking, spatulate-shaped leaves with a prominent midrib, and its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. However, it contains calcium oxalate crystals, making it potentially toxic if ingested."
