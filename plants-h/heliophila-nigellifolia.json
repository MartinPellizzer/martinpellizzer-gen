    "intro": "Heliophila nigellifolia, commonly known as blackseed heliophila, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairless or slightly hairy. Its scientific name reflects its association with the genus Heliophila, which refers to its affinity for sunlight. Heliophila nigellifolia is notable for containing essential oils and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
