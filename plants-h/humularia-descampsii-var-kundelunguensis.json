    "intro": "Humularia descampsii var. kundelunguensis, commonly known as the Kundelungu endemic, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble those of the common hibiscus. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its foliage is broad and waxy, with leaves that have a distinctive dark green color and a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
