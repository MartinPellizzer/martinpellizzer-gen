    "intro": "Hymenophyllum sturmii, commonly known as the stromboid fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a distinctive, elongated, and often curved shape, with a unique morphology that resembles a snail shell, hence its common name. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are arranged in a linear pattern on the underside of the fronds."
