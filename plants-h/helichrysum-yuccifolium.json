It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange flowers that resemble small suns, which bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes.
