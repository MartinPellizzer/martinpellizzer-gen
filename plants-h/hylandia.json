    "intro": "Hylandia, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their intricate, often showy flowers and specialized roots that can absorb nutrients from the air. Hylandia species are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they thrive in humid, tropical environments. They have pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are often covered in a spongy, white layer called velamen. The genus includes several species, some of which are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value."
