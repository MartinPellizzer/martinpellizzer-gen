    "intro": "Hieracium bichloricolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive reddish or purple band near the base. Hieracium bichloricolor is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
