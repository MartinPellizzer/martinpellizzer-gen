    "intro": "Hermannia disermifolia, commonly known as the silver leaf plant, is a perennial herb native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its striking silver-white variegated leaves. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Hermannia disermifolia produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
