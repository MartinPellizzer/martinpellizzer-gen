It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow composite flowers that consist of both ray and disk florets. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
