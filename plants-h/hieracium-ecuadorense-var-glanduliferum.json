    "intro": "Hieracium ecuadorense var. glanduliferum, commonly known as the Ecuadorean hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green color, while its flowers are small and yellowish with a central disc. This variety is notable for its glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which may play a role in its ecological interactions."
