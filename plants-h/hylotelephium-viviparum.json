    "intro": "Hylotelephium viviparum, commonly known as the \"Lion's Ear,\" is a perennial succulent plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features rosettes of fleshy, dark green leaves that are often adorned with a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ability to propagate through vivipary, where seeds germinate on the parent plant, adds to its unique botanical characteristics."
