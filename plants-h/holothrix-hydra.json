It is characterized by its submerged, filamentous growth and its ability to form dense underwater mats. The plant typically has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged in whorls along its stems. It thrives in freshwater environments with moderate to high light exposure and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Holothrix hydra plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
