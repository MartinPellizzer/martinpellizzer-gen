    "intro": "Hyssopus officinalis var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved hyssop, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features square, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common hyssop. The plant produces spikes of blue to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and borders. This variety is valued for its aromatic foliage and historical use in herbal medicine."
