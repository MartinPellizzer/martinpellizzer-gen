    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. basiternatum, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley. It is a variant of the common cow parsley, characterized by its smaller, more compact inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, parsley-like scent. The flowers are small, yellowish-green, and appear in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the Apiaceae family."
