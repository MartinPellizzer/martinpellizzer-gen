    "intro": "Hieracium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium constrictum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
