It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in early summer. Hedyotis acuminatissima is native to parts of Asia, including China, India, and Southeast Asia, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and along stream banks, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
