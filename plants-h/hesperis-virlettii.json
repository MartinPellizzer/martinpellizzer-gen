    "intro": "Hesperis virlettii, commonly known as the Alpine honesty, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, helping to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Hesperis virlettii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rock gardens and alpine displays."
