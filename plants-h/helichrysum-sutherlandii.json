    "intro": "Helichrysum sutherlandii, commonly known as the Sutherland's everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often mistaken for daisies. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage, which contains essential oils with potential medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its common name comes from its ability to retain its color when dried, resembling the appearance of everlasting flowers."
