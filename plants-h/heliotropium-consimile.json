It is a herbaceous annual or perennial species characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Heliotropium consimile is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
