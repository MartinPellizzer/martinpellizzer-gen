    "intro": "Helonias orientalis, commonly known as the oriental marsh orchid, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in eastern Asia. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its roots are often found in waterlogged conditions, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Helonias orientalis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
