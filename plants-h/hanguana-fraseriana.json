It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with palmate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in clusters and are adapted for pollination by birds and insects.
