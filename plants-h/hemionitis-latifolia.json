    "intro": "Hemionitis latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of western North America. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert environments. The plant has lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are typically green with a slightly waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis latifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
