    "intro": "Houstonia purpurea var. ciliolata, commonly known as the ciliate blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering plant due to its showy blooms. The plant features slender, grass-like stems with small, clustered flowers that are typically blue to purple in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the plant thrives in moist, acidic soils in woodland habitats. The variety ciliolata is distinguished by its finely hairy margins on the leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
