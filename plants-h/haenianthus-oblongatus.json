    "intro": "Haenianthus oblongatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing, mat-forming species that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Haenianthus oblongatus is often found in coastal dunes and other xerophytic habitats."
