    "intro": "Hymenidium hedinii, commonly known as the Hedin's lichen, is a species of lichen that belongs to the family Parmeliaceae. It is characterized by its pale yellow to orange thallus, which is often covered with a fine, powdery layer of wax. This lichen typically grows on bark, stones, and soil in arid or semi-arid environments. It is known for its ability to survive in harsh conditions due to its slow growth and resistance to desiccation. The structure of Hymenidium hedinii includes a medulla composed of loosely aggregated hyphae and a cortex that provides protection against environmental stressors."
