    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. saxigenum, commonly known as the saxifrage hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils, often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across open ground. The subspecies saxigenum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
