    "intro": "Homalocenchrus ligularis, commonly known as the coastal grass or beach grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with slender, wiry stems and small, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or pale yellow, arranged in dense clusters at the tips of the stems. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion. Its ability to thrive in harsh, saline environments makes it a valuable species for coastal restoration projects."
