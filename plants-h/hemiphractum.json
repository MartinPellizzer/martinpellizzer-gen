    "intro": "Hemiphractum, commonly known as the leafy spurge, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. They are native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. Hemiphractum species are perennial herbs that can grow up to 30 centimeters tall, with some varieties having a trailing or ascending growth habit. They are adapted to survive in harsh environments with limited water availability."
