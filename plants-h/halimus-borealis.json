    "intro": "Halimus borealis, commonly known as the northern halimus, is a rare flowering plant native to the Arctic tundra. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent leaves that store water, an adaptation to the harsh, cold climate. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in isolated populations. Due to its limited range and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
