    "intro": "Hydrobryum johnsonii, commonly known as Johnson's water moss, is a rare and specialized aquatic plant found in specific wetland habitats. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its small, leaf-like structures that are adapted for water retention. The plant typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich waters and is often found in association with other moisture-loving mosses. Its morphology includes dense, cushion-like growth forms that help it thrive in humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hydrobryum johnsonii is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
