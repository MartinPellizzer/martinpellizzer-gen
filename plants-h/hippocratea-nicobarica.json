    "intro": "Hippocratea nicobarica, commonly known as the Nicobar orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a small, epiphytic plant that grows on trees in humid, tropical environments. The plant features a slender stem with several fleshy, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a dense, white tomentum. Its flowers are showy, with a distinctive yellow-green coloration and a unique, spurred lip that is characteristic of the genus Hippocratea. This orchid is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements."
