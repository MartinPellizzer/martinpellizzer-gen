    "intro": "Hieracium bractolympicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single head, with both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in mountain ecosystems."
