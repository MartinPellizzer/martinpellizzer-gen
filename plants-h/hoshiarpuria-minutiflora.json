    "intro": "Hoshiarpuria minutiflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hoshiarpuria, is a unique member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and finely divided leaves, which give it a feathery appearance. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool, moist conditions. Its growth habit is typically herbaceous, with a short stature and a compact form. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
