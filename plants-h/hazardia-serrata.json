    "intro": "Hazardia serrata, commonly known as the rough hazardia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and hairy, grayish-green foliage. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. Hazardia serrata is adapted to arid conditions and is considered a perennial herb with a low-growing structure."
