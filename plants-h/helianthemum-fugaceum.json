    "intro": "Helianthemum fugaceum, commonly known as the transient rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. Its fleshy, succulent leaves are adapted to arid conditions, allowing it to survive in rocky or sandy soils. Helianthemum fugaceum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and coastal areas."
