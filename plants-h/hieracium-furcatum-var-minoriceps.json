    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum var. minoriceps, commonly known as the lesser hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from June to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
