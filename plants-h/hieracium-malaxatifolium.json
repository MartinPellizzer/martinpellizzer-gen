    "intro": "Hieracium malaxatifolium, commonly known as the soft-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features broad, soft, and often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in moist, disturbed soils. Hieracium malaxatifolium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks."
