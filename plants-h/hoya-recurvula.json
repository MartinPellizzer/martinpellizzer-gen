    "intro": "Hoya recurvula, commonly known as the curling wisteria, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, waxy, wisteria-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slight waxy coating, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya recurvula is popular among indoor gardeners for its elegant appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
