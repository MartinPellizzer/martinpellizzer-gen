    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. frondosiforme, commonly known as the frondose hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and plant structure. It is of interest to botanists due to its ecological role and potential for hybridization with other hawkweed species."
