    "intro": "Hieracium lapponicum, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra, meadows, and wetlands. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in cold climates. Hieracium lapponicum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
