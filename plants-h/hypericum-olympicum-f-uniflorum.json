    "intro": "Hypericum olympicum f. uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flowered goldthread, is a rare and striking variant of the golden seal plant. It is characterized by its solitary, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, contrasting with its dark green, glossy foliage. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are creeping and often form dense mats, which help it colonize rocky or woodland soils. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral morphology, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest in horticultural and ecological studies."
