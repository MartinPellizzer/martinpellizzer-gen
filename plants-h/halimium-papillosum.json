    "intro": "Halimium papillosum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in the spring, which are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
