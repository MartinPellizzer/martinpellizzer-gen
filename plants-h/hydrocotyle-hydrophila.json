    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hydrophila, commonly known as water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has floating leaves that are rounded with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small white flowers bloom in early summer, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle hydrophila plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small aquatic life."
