    "intro": "Heliophytum elongatum, commonly known as the elongated heliophyte, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, minimizing water loss. Heliophytum elongatum is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
