    "intro": "Hieracium turritiforme, commonly known as the tower dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its tall, sparsely haired stems and large, yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and have rough, hairy surfaces. The seeds are dispersed by wind via a pappus, which is a feathery structure attached to the seed."
