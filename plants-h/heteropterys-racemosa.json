    "intro": "Heteropterys racemosa, commonly known as the red-flowered mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has small, leathery leaves and relies on host trees for water and nutrients, while photosynthesizing to some extent. Its fruits are capsules that release tiny seeds, which can attach to the bark of host trees. Heteropterys racemosa is often found in humid, shaded environments within tropical forests."
