    "intro": "Houstonia salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the coastal regions of the United States. It thrives in saline and coastal environments, often found in dunes, marshes, and saltwater tidal zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered blue or purple flowers in the spring. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize sandy soils and prevent erosion. Houstonia salina is well adapted to high salt concentrations and can tolerate periodic flooding."
