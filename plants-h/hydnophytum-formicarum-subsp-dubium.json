    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum subsp. dubium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a hemi-parasitic plant that forms a symbiotic relationship with ants. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for ant colonies. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, while the ants defend it from herbivores. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique ecological role makes it an important subject in studies of plant-ant interactions."
