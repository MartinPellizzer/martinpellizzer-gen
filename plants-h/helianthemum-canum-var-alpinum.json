    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. alpinum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh alpine environment. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cold, high-altitude climates with limited soil nutrients."
