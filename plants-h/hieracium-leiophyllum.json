    "intro": "Hieracium leiophyllum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are smooth and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy underside, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The species is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
