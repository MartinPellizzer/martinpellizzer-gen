    "intro": "Hedysarum mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It features compound leaves with small, ovate leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum mucronatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
