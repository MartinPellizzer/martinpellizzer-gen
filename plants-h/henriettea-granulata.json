    "intro": "Henriettea granulata, commonly known as the granulate henriettea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many shrubs and herbs. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, and its hairy, glandular leaves. Henriettea granulata thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
