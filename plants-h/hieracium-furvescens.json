    "intro": "Hieracium furvescens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium furvescens is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread readily."
