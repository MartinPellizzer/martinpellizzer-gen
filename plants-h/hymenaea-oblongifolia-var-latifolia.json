    "intro": "Hymenaea oblongifolia var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, dark bark and large, broad leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The tree produces heavy, woody pods containing edible seeds, which are a traditional food source for some indigenous communities. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to seasonal droughts. Due to its hard, durable wood, it is also valued for timber and has ecological importance in its native habitats."
