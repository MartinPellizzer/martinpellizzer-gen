It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically 5-7 cm in length, with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Hedera gaudichaudii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its native habitat."
