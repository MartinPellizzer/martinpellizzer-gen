    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudoacranthus, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, spineless plant with thick, ribbed stems that store water, typical of desert environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are modified into spines, reducing water loss and providing protection from herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to arid conditions."
