    "intro": "Huperzia funiformis, commonly known as the broad-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of its leaves, which are dispersed by wind. Huperzia funiformis is often found in forests and rocky areas, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
