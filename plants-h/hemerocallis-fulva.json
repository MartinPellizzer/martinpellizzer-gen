    "intro": "Hemerocallis fulva, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It features sword-shaped, grass-like leaves and produces vibrant orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are short-lived, lasting only one day, hence the name \"daylily.\" It is a hardy plant that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Hemerocallis fulva is also known for its ability to naturalize and spread through rhizomes, creating dense stands over time."
