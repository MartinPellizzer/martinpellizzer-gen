    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 validum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves and yellow flower heads composed of many small florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
