    "intro": "Heterosperma maritimum var. latifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf sea bladder, is a variant of the sea bladder plant found in coastal regions. It is characterized by its broad, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain water in saline environments. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish or saltwater areas, often on sandy or muddy substrates. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, with a short flowering period during the warmer months. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to marine and coastal habitats."
