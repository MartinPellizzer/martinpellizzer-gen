    "intro": "Hieracium brachycaule, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Hieracium brachycaule is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
