    "intro": "Hieracium bajevi, commonly known as the Bajev's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a compact cluster. Native to Central Asia, this species thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as steppes and rocky slopes. The plant has a creeping growth habit with short, stolons that help it spread across the ground. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid environments, with reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss."
