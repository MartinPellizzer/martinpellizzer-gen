    "intro": "Hieracium amblycola, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
