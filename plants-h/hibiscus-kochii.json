    "intro": "Hibiscus kochii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, often with a yellow throat. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hibiscus kochii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh climates."
