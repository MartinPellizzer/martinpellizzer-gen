    "intro": "Hedera helix f. helix, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls and trellises. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
