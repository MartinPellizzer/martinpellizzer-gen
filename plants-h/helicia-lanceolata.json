It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically 5 to 10 centimeters long and have a smooth, glossy surface. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, which bloom in the spring. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation.
