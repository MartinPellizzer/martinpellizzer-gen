    "intro": "Hadrolaelia grandis, commonly known as the giant orchid, is a striking member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its pseudobulbs store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in harsh, high-altitude climates. The species is notable for its complex floral structure and is a subject of interest in both horticulture and botanical research."
