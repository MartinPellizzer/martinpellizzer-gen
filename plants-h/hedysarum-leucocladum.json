    "intro": "Hedysarum leucocladum, commonly known as the white-headed vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. Its pods are slender and contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum leucocladum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in arid and semi-arid regions."
