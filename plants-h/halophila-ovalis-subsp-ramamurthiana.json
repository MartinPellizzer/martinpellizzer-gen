    "intro": "Halophila ovalis subsp. ramamurthiana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf seagrass, is a marine plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, ribbon-like leaves and is typically found in shallow coastal waters. This subspecies thrives in brackish to fully saline environments, often forming dense underwater meadows. Its rhizomes spread along the seafloor, anchoring the plant and facilitating nutrient absorption. Halophila ovalis subsp. ramamurthiana plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms."
