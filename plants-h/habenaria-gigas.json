    "intro": "Habenaria gigas, commonly known as the giant marsh helleborine, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with dark purple veins. The plant grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and forest floors, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often forming a rosette at the base of the plant. Habenaria gigas is known for its ability to produce a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts certain pollinators."
