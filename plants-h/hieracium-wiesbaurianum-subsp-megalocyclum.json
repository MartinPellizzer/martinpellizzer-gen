    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. megalocyclum, commonly known as the giant yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and tall, branched stems that bear numerous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are arranged in clusters and are visited by various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
