    "intro": "Hydnora solmsiana, commonly known as the devil's flower, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant is notable for its unique, fleshy, and often foul-smelling flowers that emit a strong odor to attract pollinators like flies. Its flowers are usually unisexual, with separate male and female structures. Hydnora solmsiana is native to southern Africa and is considered a rare and specialized species due to its parasitic nature and specific ecological requirements."
