    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum, commonly known as the silver thyme or coastal helianthemum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in spring and early summer. The plant has dense, silver-gray foliage that is both drought-tolerant and heat-resistant, making it well-suited for rocky or coastal environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Helianthemum glaucum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and aromatic properties."
