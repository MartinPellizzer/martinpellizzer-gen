    "intro": "Hydrangea discocarpa, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicle-like inflorescences. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Hydrangea discocarpa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas with partial shade."
