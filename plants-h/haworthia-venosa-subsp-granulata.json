It features striking, pale green leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant has a short, thick stem and produces small, white, tubular flowers during the cooler months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for succulent collections. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardening."
