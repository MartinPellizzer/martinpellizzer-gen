    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. cyrtotrachelum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
