It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with three petals, typically in shades of white or pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats.
