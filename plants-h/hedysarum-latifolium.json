    "intro": "Hedysarum latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and rocky slopes. Hedysarum latifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
