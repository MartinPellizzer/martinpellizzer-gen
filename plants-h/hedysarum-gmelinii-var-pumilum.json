    "intro": "Hedysarum gmelinii var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, ascending stems with small, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces pea-like flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment. This variety is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
