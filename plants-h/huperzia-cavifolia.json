    "intro": "Huperzia cavifolia, commonly known as the rough huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, and often rough-textured leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophylls are clustered in spore-bearing cones, which are usually located at the base of the leaves. Huperzia cavifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
