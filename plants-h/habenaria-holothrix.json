    "intro": "Habenaria holothrix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its pale green to white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
