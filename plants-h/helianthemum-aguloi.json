    "intro": "Helianthemum aguloi, commonly known as the Canary Island rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
