    "intro": "Hedera umbellifera, commonly known as the umbrella-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are typically lobed and have a light green to dark green coloration. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbellate clusters, which are followed by dark blue-black berries. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover surfaces. Hedera umbellifera is also valued for its adaptability to various soil types and its use in traditional medicine."
