    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. wimmeriforme, commonly known as the shadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to other Hieracium species. It is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of mesophilous forests."
