    "intro": "Hoya esquirolii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a fragrant, nectar-rich bloom that attracts pollinators like moths and birds. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya esquirolii is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
