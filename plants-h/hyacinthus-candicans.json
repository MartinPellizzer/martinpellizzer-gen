    "intro": "Hyacinthus candicans, commonly known as the garden hyacinth, is a bulbous perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors such as purple, blue, white, and pink. The plant produces strap-like leaves and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in well-drained soils. Hyacinths are popular in gardens for their early spring blooms and are often used in floral arrangements. They are also valued for their ability to naturalize and return year after year in suitable climates."
