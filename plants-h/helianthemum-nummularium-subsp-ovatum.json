It features dense clusters of small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, hairy stalks. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
