    "intro": "Humboltia phyllocardia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapting to harsh, dry environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia phyllocardia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in low-water conditions."
