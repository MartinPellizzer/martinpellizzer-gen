    "intro": "Hymenophyllum glebarium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf wall moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often recurved and have a distinctive, finely toothed margin. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum glebarium is often found in humid, shaded forest habitats where it plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing microhabitat for other organisms."
