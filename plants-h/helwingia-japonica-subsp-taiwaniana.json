    "intro": "Helwingia japonica subsp. taiwaniana, commonly known as the Taiwan helwingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to Taiwan. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, winged fruits. It thrives in cool, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
