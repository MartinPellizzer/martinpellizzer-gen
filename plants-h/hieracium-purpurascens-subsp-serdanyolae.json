    "intro": "Hieracium purpurascens subsp. serdanyolae, commonly known as the Serdanya hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or disturbed soils, often in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
