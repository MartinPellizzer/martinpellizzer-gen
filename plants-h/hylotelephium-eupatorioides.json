    "intro": "Hylotelephium eupatorioides, commonly known as the 'Coral Bells' or 'Fairy Bells,' is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and striking, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of pink or red flowers in late summer, which are borne on upright, wiry stems. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a fine layer of white powder, a feature common in many succulent species. Hylotelelephium eupatorioides thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
