    "intro": "Habenaria demissa, commonly known as the slender lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and grasslands. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Habenaria demissa is known for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
