    "intro": "Hemiadelphis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, often clustered leaves that are typically gray-green in color, giving it a silvery appearance. The flowers are usually small and clustered in inflorescences, often with a distinctive papilionaceous (butterfly-like) structure. Hemiadelphis species are native to various regions in Africa and are adapted to dry, arid environments. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental qualities."
