    "intro": "Howelliella, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves and yellow or white flowers. The plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia, where it thrives in warm, humid climates. Howelliella species are often found in forest understories and are valued for their hard, durable wood. Due to overharvesting, many species within this genus are now threatened with extinction."
