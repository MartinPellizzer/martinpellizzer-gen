    "intro": "Hyperbaena hostmannii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. The plant plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small desert animals."
