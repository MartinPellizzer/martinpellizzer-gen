    "intro": "Hicriopteris chinensis, commonly known as Chinese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are divided into four lobes, resembling a cloverleaf shape. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and rice paddies. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft substrates, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality by absorbing nutrients. Hicriopteris chinensis is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
