    "intro": "Hieracium pandans, commonly known as the pandan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head. Hieracium pandans is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
