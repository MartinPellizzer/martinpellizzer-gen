It features upright stems that bear clusters of bright pink to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a distinctive serrated edge. This subspecies is characterized by its narrower, more elongated foliage compared to the typical variety. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
