    "intro": "Hymenophyllum frankliniae, commonly known as Franklin's haircap, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is a small, delicate plant with intricate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant is characterized by its thin, translucent leaves that are covered in tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Due to its unique appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized member of the fern family."
