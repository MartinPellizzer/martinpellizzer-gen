    "intro": "Habenaria macrura, commonly known as the long-stalked marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as marshes and swampy areas. The plant has a slender, erect stem with several leaves, and it produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale yellow flowers. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The orchid's structure and habitat make it well adapted to its wetland environment."
