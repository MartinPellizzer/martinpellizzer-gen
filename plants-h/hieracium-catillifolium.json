    "intro": "Hieracium catillifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features soft, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium catillifolium thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites."
