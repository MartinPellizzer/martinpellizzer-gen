    "intro": "Hieracium detriticeps, commonly known as the debris hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, rough leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse seeds via the wind. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
