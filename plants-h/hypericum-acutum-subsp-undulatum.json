    "intro": "Hypericum acutum subsp. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, often zigzagging stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin, giving it its subspecific name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native range."
