    "intro": "Heracleum subtomentellum, commonly known as the woolly cowparade, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are densely covered with soft, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in flat-topped clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The species is often found in temperate regions of Europe and Asia, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and soil stability."
