    "intro": "Hydrostachys hildebrandtii var. boinensis, commonly known as the Borneo waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features whorled leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped, adapted for efficient water flow. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, enhancing its ornamental value. It thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
