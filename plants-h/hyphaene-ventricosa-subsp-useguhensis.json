    "intro": "Hyphaene ventricosa subsp. useguhensis, commonly known as the Useguh palm, is a distinctive member of the Arecaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by round, fibrous fruits containing edible seeds. Its trunk is thick and often covered with a layer of fibrous material, which provides structural support and moisture retention. This subspecies is adapted to the humid, tropical conditions of its native habitat and is of interest for both ecological and horticultural studies."
