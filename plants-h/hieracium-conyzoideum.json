    "intro": "Hieracium conyzoideum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plant species and alter local ecosystems."
