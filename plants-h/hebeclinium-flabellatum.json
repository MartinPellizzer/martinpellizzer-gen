    "intro": "Hebeclinium flabellatum, commonly known as the flabellate hebeclinium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. Native to New Zealand, this plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The flowers, which are small and white, are arranged in umbrella-like clusters, giving the plant its common name. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
