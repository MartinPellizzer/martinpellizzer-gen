    "intro": "Herschelianthe, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Herschelianthe plays a role in supporting local pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
