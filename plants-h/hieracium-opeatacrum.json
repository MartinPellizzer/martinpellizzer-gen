    "intro": "Hieracium opeatacrum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium opeatacrum is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas, making it both a common weed and a valuable early successional plant."
