    "intro": "Hemarthria natans, commonly known as floating grass or water oat, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and dense, floating foliage that often forms mats on the surface of still or slow-moving freshwater bodies. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with small, inconspicuous flowers that emerge above the water. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Hemarthria natans is also used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions."
