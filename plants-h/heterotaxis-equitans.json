    "intro": "Heterotaxis equitans, commonly known as the saddleback fern, is a unique member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, horizontally growing rhizomes that form a dense network of roots. The plant features bipinnate fronds with a striking, saddle-like shape, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in shaded, moist environments. Heterotaxis equitans is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it grows on rocks or tree trunks."
