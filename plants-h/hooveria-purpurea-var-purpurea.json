It features upright, lance-shaped leaves that are dark green with a slight purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or containers. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
