    "intro": "Hieracium stelligerum subsp. albulum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters, often with a distinctive central disc. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in mountainous habitats. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in disturbed alpine environments."
