    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. vulgare, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has leathery, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
