    "intro": "Helichrysum discolor, commonly known as the variable immortelle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its yellow to orange flowers that resemble sunflowers, which are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained soils, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
