    "intro": "Helichrysum strictum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, upright growth habit and its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, persistent bracts that remain colorful even after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive texture. Helichrysum strictum is well adapted to dry, sunny conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
