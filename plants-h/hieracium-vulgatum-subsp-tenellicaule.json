    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. tenellicaule, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features upright stems that are often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and bloom from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its relatively short, slender stem compared to other hawkweed species."
