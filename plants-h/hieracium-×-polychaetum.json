    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 polychaetum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to September. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is sometimes considered a weed."
