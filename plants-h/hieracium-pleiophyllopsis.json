    "intro": "Hieracium pleiophyllopsis, commonly known as the many-leafed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a hairy stem and produces numerous small, disc-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically hairy and have a slightly rough texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
