    "intro": "Hostia rubra, commonly known as the red hosta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are typically green with a red or purple hue on the underside. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale blue, blooming in late summer. Hostia rubra prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its striking foliage and delicate floral display."
