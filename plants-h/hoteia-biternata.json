    "intro": "Hoteia biternata, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its long, strap-like leaves that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant is known for its fibrous bark, which has been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for making clothing and baskets. Hoteia biternata thrives in coastal and wetland environments, often forming dense stands that provide habitat for various native wildlife. Its ecological importance is significant in the restoration of degraded habitats in New Zealand."
