    "intro": "Hymenophyllum holotrichum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and velvety fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and have a distinctive, intricate pattern of veins. The plant reproduces via spores, which are produced on the underside of its fronds in specialized structures called sorus."
