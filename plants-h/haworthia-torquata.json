    "intro": "Haworthia torquata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear small, white or yellowish flowers during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
