    "intro": "Herrickia, commonly known as the \"butterfly plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of Central and South America, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its showy, butterfly-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including pink, purple, and white. Herrickia species typically have hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and they are often cultivated for their ornamental value. Due to habitat loss, several species are considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival."
