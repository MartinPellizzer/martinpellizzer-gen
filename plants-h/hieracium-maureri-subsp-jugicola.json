It typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in Mediterranean climates.
