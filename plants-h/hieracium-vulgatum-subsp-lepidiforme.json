    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. lepidiforme, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellowish to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, soft hairs, while the flowers are arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its specific leaf and flower characteristics."
