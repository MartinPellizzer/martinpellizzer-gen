    "intro": "Hicorius sulcata, commonly known as the African spurred tortoise, is a large terrestrial turtle native to the arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its robust, heavily armored shell and distinctive spurs on its limbs. The plant name is actually a misnomer, as Hicorius sulcata refers to a species of turtle, not a plant. This confusion highlights the importance of accurate botanical nomenclature. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name for clarification."
