It is characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common sight in wetland habitats across its native range."
