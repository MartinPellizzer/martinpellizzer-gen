    "intro": "Hibiscus deflersii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a prominent red or purple throat. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves and stems adapted to store water, allowing it to thrive in drought conditions. Hibiscus deflersii typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. Its flowers bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
