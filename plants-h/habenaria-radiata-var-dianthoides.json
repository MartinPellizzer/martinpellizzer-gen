    "intro": "Habenaria radiata var. dianthoides, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features a dense, mat-forming growth habit with slender, branching stems that bear numerous small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like cluster. The plant has a fibrous root system and typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its flowers are spurred at the base, a characteristic feature of the Orchidaceae family. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with high humidity and partial shade."
