    "intro": "Hieracium elegans, commonly known as the elegant hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically range in color from yellow to orange, and its hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist meadows and grasslands. It produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Hieracium elegans is often found in temperate climates and can sometimes be considered a weed in agricultural settings."
