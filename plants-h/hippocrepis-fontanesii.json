    "intro": "Hippocrepis fontanesii, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Gentianaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers are tubular and often have a prominent spur, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
