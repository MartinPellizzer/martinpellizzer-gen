    "intro": "Heracleum tauricum, commonly known as Caucasian cow parsley, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and umbrella-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, aromatic scent, while its roots are sometimes used in traditional medicine. However, it can be toxic if ingested in large quantities, so caution is advised."
