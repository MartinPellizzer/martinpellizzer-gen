    "intro": "Heteronoma subtriplinervium, commonly known as the three-veined fern, is a species of fern characterized by its intricate and delicate fronds. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant's leaves are typically pinnately divided with a distinct three-veined structure, giving it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
