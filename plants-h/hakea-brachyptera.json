    "intro": "Hakea brachyptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to the southwest of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in clusters, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Hakea brachyptera is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
