    "intro": "Haplopappus squarrosus, commonly known as the squarrose pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, harsh environments. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in a single head, and the leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a fluffy pappus, which aids in seed dispersal by wind."
