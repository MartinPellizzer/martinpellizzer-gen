It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known plants like eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. It produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, edible berries. Hirtella gracilipes is often found in moist, shaded understories of tropical forests, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
