    "intro": "Heleochloa minuartioides, commonly known as the moss-like grass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its dense, carpet-like growth habit. It features small, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, arranged in a tight spiral. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in spikelets, typical of the grass family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology allows it to form dense mats, which help in soil stabilization and moisture retention."
