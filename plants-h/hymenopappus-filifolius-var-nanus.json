    "intro": "Hymenopappus filifolius var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf silky blueweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States. It features small, narrow, silver-gray leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a desirable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
