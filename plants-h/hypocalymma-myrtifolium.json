It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Hypocalymma myrtifolium is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological significance."
