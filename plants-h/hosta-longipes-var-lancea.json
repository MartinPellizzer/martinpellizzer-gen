    "intro": "Hosta longipes var. lancea, commonly known as the lance-leaf hosta, is a variant of the hosta genus native to East Asia. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and modest flowering display."
