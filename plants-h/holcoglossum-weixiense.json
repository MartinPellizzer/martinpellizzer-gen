    "intro": "Holcoglossum weixiense, commonly known as the Weixi tongue orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is characterized by its unique, strap-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with well-drained soil, often growing on rocky substrates or in shaded forest areas. Its conservation status is critically endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Holcoglossum weixiense plays an important role in the ecological balance of its native habitat and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
