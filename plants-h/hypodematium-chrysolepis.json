    "intro": "Hypodematium chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden-stemmed hypodematium, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America and is known for its distinctive golden-yellow stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
