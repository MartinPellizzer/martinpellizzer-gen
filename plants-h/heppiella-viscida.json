    "intro": "Heppiella viscida, commonly known as the sticky liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth and the presence of a sticky, gelatinous substance on its thallus, which aids in water retention. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its structure consists of a flattened, leaf-like thallus with distinct lobes and a central axis. Heppiella viscida plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
