    "intro": "Heleogiton pungens, commonly known as the stinging nettle, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its hollow, hairless stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant is native to temperate regions and thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its most distinctive feature is the presence of stinging hairs on the leaves and stems, which release irritants when touched. Heleogiton pungens is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and forest clearings. It plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing food for certain insects and wildlife."
