    "intro": "Hopea montana, commonly known as the Burmese ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, heavy, and durable wood, which is highly valued for its strength and resistance to decay. The tree can grow up to 40 meters tall, with a straight trunk and a broad, rounded crown. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic in shape, with a leathery texture and dark green color. Hopea montana produces small, pale yellow flowers followed by woody capsules containing several seeds."
