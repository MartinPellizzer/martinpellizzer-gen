    "intro": "Helichrysum thomsonii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble miniature suns. The plant produces papery, honey-scented bracts that persist long after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation."
