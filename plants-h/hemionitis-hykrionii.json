    "intro": "Hemionitis hykrionii, commonly known as the Kashmir Himalayan fern, is a rare and unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other ferns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are typically located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis hykrionii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
