    "intro": "Helianthemum fumana, commonly known as the smoky rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish, powdery coating. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky or well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helianthemum fumana is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in arid environments."
