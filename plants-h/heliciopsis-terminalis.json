    "intro": "Heliciopsis terminalis, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a parasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and typically grows on the branches of host trees such as Dipterocarps. The plant has small, clustered leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are often fragrant. Its fruits are small berries that contain seeds dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can weaken its host if left unchecked, making it a significant concern in forest ecosystems."
