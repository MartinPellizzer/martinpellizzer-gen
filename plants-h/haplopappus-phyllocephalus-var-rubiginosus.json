    "intro": "Haplopappus phyllocephalus var. rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stemmed pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive involucral bracts. The plant typically grows as a low, mat-forming perennial with gray-green foliage and red-tinged stems. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its drought tolerance and unique appearance, it is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh environmental conditions."
