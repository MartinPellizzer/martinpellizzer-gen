    "intro": "Hydrocotyle exigua, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Hydrocotyle exigua plays a role in stabilizing aquatic habitats and providing shelter for small aquatic organisms."
