    "intro": "Hoya membranifolia, commonly known as the Paper Wound Orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, glossy leaves that are often described as resembling parchment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. Hoya membranifolia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
