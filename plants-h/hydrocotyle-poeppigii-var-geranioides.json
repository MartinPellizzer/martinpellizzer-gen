    "intro": "Hydrocotyle poeppigii var. geranioides, commonly known as the Indian water plant or silver leaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, silver-veined leaves that are glossy and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers arranged in umbels, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and wetlands. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
