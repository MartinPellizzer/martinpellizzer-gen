    "intro": "Hakea oleoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Hakea oleoides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
