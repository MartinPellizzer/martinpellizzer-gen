    "intro": "Heptapleurum violeum, commonly known as the purple-leafed heptapleurum, is a species of evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage, with leaves that often display a striking purple or reddish hue, especially under sunny conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in shaded gardens."
