    "intro": "Hohenbergia platynema, commonly known as the silver velvet fern, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The leaves are typically gray-green in color and can grow up to 30 inches in length. It produces striking red or orange flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation and thrives in bright, indirect light with well-draining soil."
