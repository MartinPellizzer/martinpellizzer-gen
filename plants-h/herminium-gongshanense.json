    "intro": "Herminium gongshanense, commonly known as the Gongshan adder's mouth, is a rare orchid species native to the Yunnan province in China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spurred labellum and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and forest margins, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Herminium gongshanense is notable for its small, pale yellow to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
