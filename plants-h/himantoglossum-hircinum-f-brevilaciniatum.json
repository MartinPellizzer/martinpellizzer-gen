    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. brevilaciniatum, commonly known as the short-lipped hare's-foot clover, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and trifoliate leaves, which are typically shorter and more compact than those of the typical form. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of the Alps and Carpathians. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
