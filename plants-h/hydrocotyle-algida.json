It is characterized by its finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and wet meadows. Hydrocotyle algida is typically found in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to tolerate wet or waterlogged soils."
