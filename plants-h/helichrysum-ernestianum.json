It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that remain intact even after drying, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is usually gray-green with a slightly fuzzy texture, and it produces small, narrow leaves. It is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its striking color and drought tolerance."
