    "intro": "Hedysarum caespitosum, commonly known as the creeping sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and wastelands. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval leaflets and produces yellow or reddish flowers in early summer. Its root system is fibrous and can form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Hedysarum caespitosum is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
