It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and fleshy, evergreen leaves that are typically oblong in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
