    "intro": "Hybidium asturiense, commonly known as the Asturian bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Asturian region of northern Spain. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous areas, often near streams or in shaded woodlands. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hybidium asturiense is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native environment."
