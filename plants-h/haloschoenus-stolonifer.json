    "intro": "Haloschoenus stolonifer, commonly known as the saltgrass, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing clumps and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt crystals. The plant produces small, pale green to brown flowers in spikelets, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stem. Haloschoenus stolonifer thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and preventing soil erosion in coastal areas."
