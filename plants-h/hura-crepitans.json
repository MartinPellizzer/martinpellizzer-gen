    "intro": "Hura crepitans, commonly known as the splinter tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive, spiky fruits that contain toxic seeds. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are pollinated by insects. Its bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties. The tree is also known for its explosive fruit dispersal mechanism, which aids in seed propagation."
