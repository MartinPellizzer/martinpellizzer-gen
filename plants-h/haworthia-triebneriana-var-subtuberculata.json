    "intro": "Haworthia triebneriana var. subtuberculata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale blue markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically a vibrant green with a waxy texture, and they often have small, tuberculate protrusions along their surfaces. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
