    "intro": "Hermione \u00d7 longiflora, commonly known as the hybrid honeysuckle, is a deciduous shrub characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in late spring. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring arching branches and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil, making it a versatile addition to gardens. Its botanical name reflects its hybrid origin, combining traits from both parent species."
