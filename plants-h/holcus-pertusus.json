    "intro": "Holcus pertusus, commonly known as the woolly grass or hairy bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its distinctive, soft, hairy leaves that give it a fluffy appearance. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and coastal areas. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the leaf sheaths, making it less conspicuous than other grasses. Holcus pertusus plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
