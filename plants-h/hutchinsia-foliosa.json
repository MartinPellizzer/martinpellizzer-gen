It is native to South Africa, specifically the Western Cape province, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. It is often found in fynbos vegetation, which is adapted to the region's Mediterranean climate. Hutchinsia foliosa is an ornamental plant appreciated for its compact form and delicate floral display."
