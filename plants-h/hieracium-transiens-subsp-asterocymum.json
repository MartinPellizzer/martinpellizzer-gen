    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. asterocymum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and flowering heads composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically has basal and cauline leaves that are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed or toothed margin. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its variability in morphology, it is often challenging to distinguish from other hawkweed species without detailed botanical analysis."
