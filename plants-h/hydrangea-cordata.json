    "intro": "Hydrangea cordata, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hydrangea cordata prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its foliage turns vibrant shades of red and orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest to the landscape."
