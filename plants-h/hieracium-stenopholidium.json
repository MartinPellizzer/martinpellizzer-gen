It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, daisy-like structure. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed soils."
