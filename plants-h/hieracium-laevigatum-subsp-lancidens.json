It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and somewhat hairy. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to other members of the species."
