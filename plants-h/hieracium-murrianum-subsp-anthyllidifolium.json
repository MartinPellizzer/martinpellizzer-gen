    "intro": "Hieracium murrianum subsp. anthyllidifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with ray florets and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller flower heads compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
