    "intro": "Hesperocyparis benthamii, commonly known as the California incense cedar, is a species of conifer native to the western United States. It is characterized by its aromatic, scale-like leaves and conical shape, typically growing in coastal and mountainous regions. The tree produces small, winged seeds enclosed in a woody cone, which are dispersed by wind. Its bark is thick and fissured, providing a rugged appearance, while its wood is valued for its durability and scent. This species plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various wildlife species."
