    "intro": "Hieracium albacetum, commonly known as the white hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow to orange in color, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium albacetum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes be invasive in non-native environments."
