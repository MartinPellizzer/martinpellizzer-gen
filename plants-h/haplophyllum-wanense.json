    "intro": "Haplophyllum wanense, commonly known as the Wanese sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the rocky habitats of southern China. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are narrow, fleshy, and adapted to conserve water in arid environments. Haplophyllum wanense is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations and limited distribution."
