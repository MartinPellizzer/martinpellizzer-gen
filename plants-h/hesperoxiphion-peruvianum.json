    "intro": "Hesperoxiphion peruvianum, commonly known as the Peruvian flameflower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically opposite and covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention in its arid habitat. Hesperoxiphion peruvianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
