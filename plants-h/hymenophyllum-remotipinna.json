    "intro": "Hymenophyllum remotipinna, commonly known as the slender fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its intricate leaf venation and ability to retain moisture in its humid habitat."
