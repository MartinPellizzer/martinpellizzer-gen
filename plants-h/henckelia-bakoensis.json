    "intro": "Henckelia bakoensis, commonly known as the Bako henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its ornamental foliage and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers, which are usually white or pale pink, bloom in clusters and are accompanied by small, rounded bracts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native region."
