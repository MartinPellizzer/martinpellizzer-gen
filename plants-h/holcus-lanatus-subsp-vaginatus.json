    "intro": "Holcus lanatus subsp. vaginatus, commonly known as the velvet fescue, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, soft foliage that gives it a velvety texture. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense panicle, with spikelets that are often enclosed in a sheath, a feature that distinguishes it from other fescue species. It plays an important ecological role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
