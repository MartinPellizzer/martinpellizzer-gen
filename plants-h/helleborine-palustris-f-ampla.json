    "intro": "Helleborine palustris f. ampla, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh helleborine, is a perennial orchid native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often broader than those of the typical species. The plant produces striking, hooded flowers in shades of green and brown, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in peat bogs and damp woodlands. This orchid is known for its ability to form mycorrhizal associations with fungi, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
