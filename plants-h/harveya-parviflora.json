    "intro": "Harveya parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered harveya, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and attractive blue or violet flowers. The plant typically blooms in spring and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Harveya parviflora thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, sunny environment to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
