    "intro": "Hoppea dichotoma, commonly known as the dichotomous hoppea, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching pattern, where the stems split into two equal parts, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Hoppea dichotoma is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
