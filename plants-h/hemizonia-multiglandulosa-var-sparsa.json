    "intro": "Hemizonia multiglandulosa var. sparsa, commonly known as the sparse-glandular hemizonia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular-dotted. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
