It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its small, spiny leaves and showy flowers make it both ecologically and botanically notable."
