    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. leucolividuliforme, commonly known as the white-veined hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. The subspecies is notable for its pale, almost white veins in the leaves, setting it apart from other hawkweed species."
