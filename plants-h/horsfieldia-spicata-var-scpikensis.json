    "intro": "Horsfieldia spicata var. scpikensis, commonly known as the Spiky Horsfield's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, nutrient-rich soil to flourish. Its unique floral structure and ornamental appeal make it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is also considered vulnerable in its natural range."
