    "intro": "Haplopteris owariensis, commonly known as the Owari fern, is a species of polypodioid fern native to Japan. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive, finely divided structure. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Haplopteris owariensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its unique foliage."
