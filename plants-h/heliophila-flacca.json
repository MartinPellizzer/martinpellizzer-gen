It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and wetlands. Heliophila flacca is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
