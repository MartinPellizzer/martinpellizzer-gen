    "intro": "Hydnophytum inerme, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its leaf-like structures. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often hidden among its foliage. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks. Due to its specialized growth habits, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
