    "intro": "Heliophila dentifera, commonly known as the toothed heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Heliophila dentifera is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
