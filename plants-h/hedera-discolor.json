    "intro": "Hedera discolor, commonly known as the variegated ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dark green leaves with distinctive white or cream-colored veins, which give it its unique appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera discolor is relatively slow-growing and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full shade."
