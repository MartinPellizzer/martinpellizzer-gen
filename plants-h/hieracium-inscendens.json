    "intro": "Hieracium inscendens, commonly known as the burning hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It produces small, seed-like structures called cypselae, which are dispersed by wind. Hieracium inscendens is known for its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas, making it both a common wildflower and a potential weed."
