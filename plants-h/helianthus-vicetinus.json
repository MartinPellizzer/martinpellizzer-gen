    "intro": "Helianthus vicetinus, commonly known as the Vicetinus sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features large, showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, which are characteristic of the sunflower genus. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Helianthus vicetinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
