    "intro": "Herniaria latifolia subsp. litardierei, commonly known as the broadleaf herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white, powdery wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, often in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland habitats with well-drained conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
