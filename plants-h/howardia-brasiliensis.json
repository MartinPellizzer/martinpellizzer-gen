It is a small, compact cactus that typically grows to a height of about 10-15 centimeters. The plant features a single stem with a distinctive red or orange coloration, especially when exposed to full sun. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months. Howardia brasiliensis is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
