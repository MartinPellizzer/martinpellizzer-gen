    "intro": "Hybosema, commonly known as the African orchid, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its showy, often fragrant flowers. The plants typically have long, slender stems and broad, strap-like leaves. Hybosema species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants, often in humid, shaded environments. Their floral structures are adapted for specific pollination mechanisms, often involving insects or birds."
