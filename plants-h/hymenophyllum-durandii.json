    "intro": "Hymenophyllum durandii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in a fine, silvery coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are surrounded by a protective indusium. Hymenophyllum durandii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
