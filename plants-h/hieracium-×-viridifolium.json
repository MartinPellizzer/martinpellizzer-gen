    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 viridifolium, commonly known as the greenleaf hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has finely divided, grass-like leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
