    "intro": "Hordeum intermedium var. intercedens, commonly known as intermediate barley, is a botanical species belonging to the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its intermediate morphology between wild barley and cultivated barley, with slender stalks and spikelets that bear small, two-rowed grains. This plant typically grows in temperate regions and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It has been studied for its potential in agricultural breeding programs due to its genetic diversity and adaptability. Its flowering period usually occurs in late spring to early summer, depending on the climate."
