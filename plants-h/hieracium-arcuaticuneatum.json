    "intro": "Hieracium arcuaticuneatum, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are often curved or bent, giving it its common name, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Hieracium arcuaticuneatum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
