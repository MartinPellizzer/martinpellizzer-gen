    "intro": "Hieracium praecurrens var. jaworowae, commonly known as the Jaworowae hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
