    "intro": "Hermannia prismatocarpoides, commonly known as the glassy false hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, translucent, waxy leaves that give it a glass-like appearance. The plant produces showy, pink or red bracteate inflorescences that resemble hibiscus flowers, though it is not closely related. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. The unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and collectors."
