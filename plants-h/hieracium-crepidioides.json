    "intro": "Hieracium crepidioides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are alternate, rough-surfaced, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in flat-topped clusters. Hieracium crepidioides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
