    "intro": "Hosta japonica var. caerulea, commonly known as the blue hosta, is a perennial plant native to Japan. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are a striking shade of blue-green. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and spreads slowly, forming a dense clump. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its foliage is the main ornamental feature, as it produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in early summer."
