    "intro": "Heliotropium azzanum, commonly known as the African heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub or subshrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, characterized by its branching structure and hairy stems. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint scent reminiscent of vanilla. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine hairs. Heliotropium azzanum is adapted to survive in dry conditions, with deep roots and a low-growing habit to reduce water loss."
