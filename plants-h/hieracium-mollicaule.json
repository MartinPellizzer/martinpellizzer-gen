It is characterized by its hairy, soft leaves and yellow disk flowers with ray florets. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant's morphology includes a basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that rise above the foliage. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
