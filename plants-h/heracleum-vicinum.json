    "intro": "Heracleum vicinum, commonly known as lesser cowparsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its sap contains irritants that can cause skin reactions, and it is often mistaken for more toxic relatives like giant hogweed. The plant is also known to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
