    "intro": "Hieracium fragile proles ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved brittle hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy stems and basal rosettes of oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Due to its fragile structure, it is often found in areas with gentle vegetation competition."
