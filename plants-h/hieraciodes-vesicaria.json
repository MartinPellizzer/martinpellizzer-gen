    "intro": "Hieraciodes vesicaria, commonly known as the bladder fern, is a species of fern native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, often hairy fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its spores are produced in small, bladder-like structures called sorus, which are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it a notable species in ecological studies."
