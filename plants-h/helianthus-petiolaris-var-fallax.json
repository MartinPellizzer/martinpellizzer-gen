    "intro": "Helianthus petiolaris var. fallax, commonly known as the fallax sunflower, is a variant of the sunflower species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are composite, consisting of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is well-suited for garden cultivation due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
