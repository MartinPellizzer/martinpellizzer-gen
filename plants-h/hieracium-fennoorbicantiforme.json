    "intro": "Hieracium fennoorbicantiforme, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the dandelion family. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a lobed or serrated margin. Hieracium fennoorbicantiforme thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates."
