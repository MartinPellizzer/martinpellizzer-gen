    "intro": "Hakea megalosperma, commonly known as the large-seeded hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, which are attracted to its nectar. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
