It features slender, often hairy stems that branch profusely, and its small, bright yellow flowers are clustered in terminal spikes. The leaves are usually opposite, ovate to elliptic in shape, and covered with fine pubescence. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can make it a persistent weed in cultivated areas."
