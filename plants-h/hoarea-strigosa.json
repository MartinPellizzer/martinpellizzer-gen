    "intro": "Hoarea strigosa, commonly known as the woolly hakea, is a perennial shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding insects. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to poor, sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in harsh conditions. Hoarea strigosa is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
