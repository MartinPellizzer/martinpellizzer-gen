    "intro": "Habenaria ocadiziana, commonly known as the Ocadi's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is a terrestrial herb with a sympodial growth habit, characterized by its rhizomatous structure. The plant produces showy, spurred flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, with a distinct lip that aids in pollination. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a humid environment to flourish. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded forest understories."
