It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broad and often have a rough texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium euryeilema is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
