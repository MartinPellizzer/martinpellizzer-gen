    "intro": "Hakea ulicina, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that range in color from white to pink, which appear in late winter to early spring. Hakea ulicina is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native wildlife."
