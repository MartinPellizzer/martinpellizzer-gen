    "intro": "Hakea levis, commonly known as the smooth hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical, woody stems that are often covered in a smooth, greyish bark. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant characteristics. Hakea levis is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in coastal and sandy soils."
