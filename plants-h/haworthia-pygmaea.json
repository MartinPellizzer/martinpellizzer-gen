    "intro": "Haworthia pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves with distinctive white tubercles and translucent windows. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
