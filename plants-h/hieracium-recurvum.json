    "intro": "Hieracium recurvum, commonly known as the bentleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish or purplish underside. Hieracium recurvum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain ecosystems."
