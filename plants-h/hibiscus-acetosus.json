    "intro": "Hibiscus acetosus, commonly known as the sour or wild hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to various regions in Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent central pistil. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with heart-shaped, broad leaves. Its flowers are known to emit a mild, acidic scent, which is reflected in its common name. Hibiscus acetosus is often found in moist, sunny habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges."
