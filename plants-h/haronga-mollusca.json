    "intro": "Haronga mollusca, commonly known as the African moon snail, is a large sea snail found in the Indo-Pacific region. It belongs to the family Anomatidae and is characterized by its heavy, spiral-shaped shell. The shell is typically smooth and can vary in color from white to brown, depending on the environment. Haronga mollusca is a nocturnal predator that feeds on other mollusks, using its radula to drill into their shells. Its anatomy includes a well-developed muscular foot for movement and a prominent mantle that covers its internal organs."
