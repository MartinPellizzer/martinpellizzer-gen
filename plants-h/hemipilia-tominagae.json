    "intro": "Hemipilia tominagae, commonly known as the Tominaga's hemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing pale pink to white petals with a subtle fragrance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, humus-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
