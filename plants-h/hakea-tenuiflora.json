    "intro": "Hakea tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking, bottle-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange, typically appearing in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for coastal and sandy environments. Hakea tenuiflora is also valued for its ecological role, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
