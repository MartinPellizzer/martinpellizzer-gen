    "intro": "Heterotheca hyssopifolia var. subulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and small, daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flower heads. The variety subulata is distinguished by its more elongated and narrow leaves compared to the typical form of H. hyssopifolia."
