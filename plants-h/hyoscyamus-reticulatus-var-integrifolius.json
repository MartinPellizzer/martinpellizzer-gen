    "intro": "Hyoscyamus reticulatus var. integrifolius, commonly known as the horned toad or desert horned toad, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, leaf-like structures that resemble the skin of a horned toad, providing it with a natural camouflage. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically broad and deeply lobed. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and contains toxic alkaloids, which can be harmful to humans and animals. This plant is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments."
