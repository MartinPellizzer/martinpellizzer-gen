    "intro": "Hypericum ericoides subsp. roberti, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically from May to July. The plant has narrow, needle-like leaves and produces red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. This subspecies is closely related to other Hypericum species but is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific geographic distribution."
