    "intro": "Hieraciodes, commonly known as alpine lady's-mantle, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in alpine and arctic regions, where they thrive in cold, rocky environments. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. Hieraciodes species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
