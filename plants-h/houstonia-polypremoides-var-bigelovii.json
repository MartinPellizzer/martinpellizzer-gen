    "intro": "Houstonia polypremoides var. bigelovii, commonly known as the Bigelow's blue-eyed grass, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, though it is often mistaken for a flowering herb due to its delicate appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring, typically in clusters at the tips of its slender stems. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along streambanks. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and unique floral structure, making it a notable species in its native habitat."
