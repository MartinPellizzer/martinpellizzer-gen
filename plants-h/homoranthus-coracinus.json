    "intro": "Homoranthus coracinus, commonly known as the horned rock-heath, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, horn-like tubercles on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Homoranthus coracinus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
