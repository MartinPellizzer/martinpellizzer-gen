    "intro": "Hypobathrum leucocarpum, commonly known as the white-fleshed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the surrounding soil, and it has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
