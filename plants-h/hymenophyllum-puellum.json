    "intro": "Hymenophyllum puellum, commonly known as the silver maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of minute, hair-like structures called trichomes. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually evergreen and remain green throughout the year, though they may darken in response to environmental stress. Hymenophyllum puellum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
