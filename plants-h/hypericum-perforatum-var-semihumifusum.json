    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. semihumifusum, commonly known as the semi-humifusum St. John's wort, is a variant of the widely recognized St. John's wort species. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and leaves with translucent dots, which are visible when held up to light. This variant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical features include narrow, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. While it shares many traits with the common St. John's wort, it is less widely studied and less commonly cultivated."
