    "intro": "Hormopetalum gracile, commonly known as the slender sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features small, fleshy, green to blue-green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early spring. Hormopetalum gracile is well adapted to harsh environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
