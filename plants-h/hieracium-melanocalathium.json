    "intro": "Hieracium melanocalathium, commonly known as the black-hooded hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a hairy, upright stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are typically yellow, with a distinctive dark central disk that gives it its common name. Hieracium melanocalathium is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
