    "intro": "Hebanthe decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hebanthe, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that often resemble those of other species, a trait that may aid in pollination. The plant typically grows as an annual or perennial herb, with opposite leaves that are often hairy and serrated. Its flowers are usually brightly colored, ranging from purple to red, and are arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Hebanthe decipiens is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
