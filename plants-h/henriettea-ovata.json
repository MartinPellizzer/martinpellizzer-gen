    "intro": "Henriettea ovata, commonly known as the oval leaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its ovate, glossy leaves and its striking, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, Henriettea ovata is considered endangered and is often found in protected botanical gardens."
