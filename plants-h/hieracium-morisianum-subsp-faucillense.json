It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into achene fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
