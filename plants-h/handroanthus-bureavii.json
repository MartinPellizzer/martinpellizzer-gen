    "intro": "Handroanthus bureavii, commonly known as the yellow bell tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its striking yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting a variety of pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth surface. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The tree is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
