    "intro": "Halogeton tetrandrus, commonly known as the four-angled saltbush, is a halophyte native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, four-angled stems and small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its ability to thrive in saline soils makes it an important species for soil stabilization in harsh environments. Halogeton tetrandrus is also used in some traditional medicinal practices due to its potential health benefits."
