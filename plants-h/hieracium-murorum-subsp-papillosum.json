It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are hairy and can have a slightly lobed appearance, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. This subspecies is distinguished by its prominent, fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
