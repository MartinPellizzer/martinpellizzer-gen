    "intro": "Huernia hislopii subsp. hislopii, commonly known as the Cape candelabra, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a short, thick stem with a rosette of fleshy, greenish-yellow leaves that are covered in small, white tubercles. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts and xerophytic gardens."
