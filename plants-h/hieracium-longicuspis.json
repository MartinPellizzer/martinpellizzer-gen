    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius longicuspis, commonly known as the long-toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Its name refers to the long, sharp teeth on the leaf margins, which are a distinguishing feature. It is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
