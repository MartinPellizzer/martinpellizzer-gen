It is a trailing evergreen vine characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoya odorata thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil with moderate humidity. It is popular among houseplants due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
