    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides var. tuberifera, commonly known as the tuberous marsh mallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as wetlands and marshy areas. Its tuberous roots are an important adaptation for storing nutrients and surviving dry periods."
