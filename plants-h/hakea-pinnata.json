    "intro": "Hakea pinnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a pinnate pattern, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, woody flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Hakea pinnata is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
