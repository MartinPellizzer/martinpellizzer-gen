    "intro": "Holcus caespitosus, commonly known as tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Holcus caespitosus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
