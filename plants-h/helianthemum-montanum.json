    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum, commonly known as the mountain sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy ornamental plant."
