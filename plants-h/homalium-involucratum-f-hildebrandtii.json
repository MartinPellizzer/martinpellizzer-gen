    "intro": "Homalium involucratum f. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's gloryflower, is a rare shrub native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble flowers but are actually clusters of small, greenish cyathia. The plant features elliptical,\u9769\u8d28 (leathery) leaves with a glossy surface and a distinctive, aromatic scent. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forests. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is highly sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
