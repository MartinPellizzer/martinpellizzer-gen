    "intro": "Hyoseris, commonly known as the yellow marshhead, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in wet or marshy environments, often along the edges of ponds or in damp grasslands. They are characterized by their bright yellow flowers, which are usually composite, consisting of many small florets arranged in a head. Hyoseris species are perennial herbs with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The genus includes several species, such as Hyoseris lappula, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia."
