    "intro": "Hieracium chlorellum subsp. niviferum, commonly known as the snow-hued hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine white bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head, which are surrounded by a ring of pale green to white ray florets. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
