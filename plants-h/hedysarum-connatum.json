    "intro": "Hedysarum connatum, commonly known as the purple vetch, is a perennial legume native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in temperate climates. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pinkish-purple. Its fruit is a slender pod containing several elliptical seeds. Hedysarum connatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its nitrogen-fixing ability and hardy nature."
