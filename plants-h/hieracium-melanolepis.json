    "intro": "Hieracium melanolepis, commonly known as the black-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or black. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing achenes that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium melanolepis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
