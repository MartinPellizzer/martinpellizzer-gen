It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. It is a relatively rare species, found in specific microhabitats within the mountainous regions of the Alps."
