    "intro": "Hieracium aphyllum subsp. singulare, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a few narrow, grass-like foliage at the base. The plant produces small, yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
