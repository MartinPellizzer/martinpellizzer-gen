    "intro": "Hagenbachia columbiana, commonly known as the Pacific coast hagenbachia, is a rare flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and along stream banks. It produces small, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
