    "intro": "Hesperaloe parviflora subsp. bechtoldii, commonly known as the Bechtold's red yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its stiff, sword-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces clusters of bright red flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
