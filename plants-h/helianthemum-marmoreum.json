It features dense clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, often with a marbled appearance. The plant has succulent-like foliage, with fleshy, gray-green leaves that help it survive in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it both a hardy and aesthetically pleasing plant."
