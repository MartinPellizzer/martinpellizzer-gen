    "intro": "Hieraciodes heldreichiana, commonly known as the Heldreich's rock-rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
