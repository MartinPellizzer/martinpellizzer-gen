    "intro": "Habenaria brachyphyton, commonly known as the short-leaved butterfly orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, erect growth habit and produces small, delicate flowers with a distinctive butterfly-like appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understoreys, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white. This orchid is often found in mountainous regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
