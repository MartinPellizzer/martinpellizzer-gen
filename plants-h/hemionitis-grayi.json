    "intro": "Hemionitis grayi, commonly known as the gray's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the arid regions of western North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, creeping rhizomes and small, clustered fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, semi-desert environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are typically found on the underside of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis grayi is considered a sensitive indicator species for ecological health."
