    "intro": "Hemizonia frutescens, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in harsh, desert environments. Hemizonia frutescens is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
