    "intro": "Helichrysum ambiguum var. paucisetum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
