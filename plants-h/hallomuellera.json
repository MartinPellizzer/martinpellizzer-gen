    "intro": "Hallomuellera, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Ecuador. The plants are evergreen shrubs with leathery, elliptical leaves that are often glossy and dark green. They produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. Hallomuellera species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in rock gardens or as part of native plant landscapes."
