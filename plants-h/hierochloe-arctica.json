    "intro": "Hierochloe arctica, commonly known as Arctic feathergrass, is a perennial grass species native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and delicate, feathery inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in alpine and arctic environments, where it thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hierochloe arctica plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous regions."
