    "intro": "Hieracium lamprochaetoides, commonly known as the silver-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-gray, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture and reflect sunlight. Its flowers are typically yellow with a distinctive, elongated shape, and it produces small, achene fruits with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium lamprochaetoides is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
