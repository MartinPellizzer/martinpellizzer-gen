    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. imbricatum, commonly known as the rock hound, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and covered in fine, translucent scales. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in small, stalked groups called sorus. It is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices, where it forms dense mats. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
