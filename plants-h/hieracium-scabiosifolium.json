    "intro": "Hieracium scabiosifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, serrated leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its flowering stems produce yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium scabiosifolium is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
