    "intro": "Huperzia affinis, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen morphology with small, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a rosette or spiral pattern. The plant is typically found growing on rocky substrates in temperate and tropical regions, often in shaded, moist environments. It lacks true roots and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its leaf surfaces. Huperzia affinis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
