    "intro": "Hieracium anolcophyton, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
