It consists of several species, most of which are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plants are typically small trees or shrubs, characterized by their smooth, often flaky bark and simple, alternate leaves. Their fruits are fleshy, usually yellow or orange, and contain a single large seed. The genus is notable for its economic importance, particularly for the edible fruits produced by some species."
