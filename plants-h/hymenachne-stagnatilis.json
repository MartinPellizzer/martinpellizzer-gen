    "intro": "Hymenachne stagnatilis, commonly known as the water hyena grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often submerged or floating, with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Hymenachne stagnatilis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
