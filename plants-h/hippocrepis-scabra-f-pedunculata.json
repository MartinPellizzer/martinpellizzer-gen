    "intro": "Hippocrepis scabra f. pedunculata, commonly known as the hairy helmet orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and striking, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically pale yellow to orange in color. The plant prefers calcareous soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
