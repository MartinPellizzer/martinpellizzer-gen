    "intro": "Habenaria foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
