    "intro": "Haemanthus bivalvis, commonly known as the two-valved haemanthus, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, umbel-like clusters of white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has strap-shaped, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its bulbs are adapted for storing water and nutrients, allowing it to survive in its natural habitat. Haemanthus bivalvis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and rockeries."
