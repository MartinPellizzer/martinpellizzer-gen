    "intro": "Hoya mirabilis, commonly known as the wax plant or the devil's ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya mirabilis is a trailing plant that can be grown as a houseplant or in hanging baskets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
