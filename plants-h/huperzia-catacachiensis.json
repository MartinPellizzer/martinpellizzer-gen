The plant features elongated, spirally arranged leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its sporophytes are characterized by a short, stout stem with whorls of leaves and sporangia that produce spores for reproduction. Huperzia catacachiensis plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various organisms."
