    "intro": "Haplolobus nubigenus, commonly known as the cloud-like lichen, is a unique foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leaf-like thallus that often appears fluffy or cloud-like in texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae and fungi, which contribute to its ability to photosynthesize and absorb nutrients. It typically grows on tree bark, rocks, or soil in temperate regions. Due to its fragile structure, it is sensitive to environmental changes and serves as an indicator of air quality."
