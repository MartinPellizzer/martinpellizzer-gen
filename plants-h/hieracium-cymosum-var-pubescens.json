It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, pubescent hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
