    "intro": "Hadrolaelia wittigiana f. candida, commonly known as the white-flowered orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the Andes. It is characterized by its elegant, white petals and a subtle, fragrant aroma. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions. Its foliage consists of broad, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its pale flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicately endangered species."
