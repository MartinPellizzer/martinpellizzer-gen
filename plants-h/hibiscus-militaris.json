    "intro": "Hibiscus militaris, commonly known as the military hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red. The plant features heart-shaped leaves and grows as an herbaceous perennial in its native habitat. Hibiscus militaris thrives in wet, marshy environments and is often found in swamps or along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its ecological role and its use in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
