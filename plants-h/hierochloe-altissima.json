    "intro": "Hierochloe altissima, commonly known as tall hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and fine, silver-green blades that often form dense, tufted clumps. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically pale green to brown in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and wetlands. Hierochloe altissima is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for invertebrates."
