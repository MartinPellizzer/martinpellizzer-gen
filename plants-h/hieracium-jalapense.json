It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium jalapense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
