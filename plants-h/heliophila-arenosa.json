    "intro": "Heliophila arenosa, commonly known as sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to sandy soils in arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of blue or violet. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in dry conditions, with deep roots that help it access water from deeper soil layers. Heliophila arenosa is often found in coastal dunes and other sandy habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing the soil."
