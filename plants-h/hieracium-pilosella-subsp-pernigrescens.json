    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pernigrescens, commonly known as the darkening hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often bluish-green in color. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, and they bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its darkening stems and leaves as they age, giving it its common name."
