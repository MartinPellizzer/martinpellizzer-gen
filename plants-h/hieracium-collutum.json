    "intro": "Hieracium collutum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has basal leaves that are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium collutum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
