    "intro": "Helia loeseneriana, commonly known as the Loesener's helia, is a rare and lesser-known flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
