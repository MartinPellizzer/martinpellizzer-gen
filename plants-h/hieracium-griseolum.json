It is characterized by its hairy, grayish-green stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces daisy-like flowers with yellow centers and white to pale pink petals, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadside areas. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
