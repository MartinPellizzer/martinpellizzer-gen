    "intro": "Hedypnois arenaria var. divisa, commonly known as the divided sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a sprawling habit with fleshy, succulent leaves that are typically lobed or divided, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by pale green, apple-shaped fruits. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry, sunny habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
