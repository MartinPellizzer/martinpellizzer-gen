This plant is typically found in temperate regions and thrives in well-drained soils. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets with sessile lemmas and awns, distinguishing it from other barley varieties. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in ecological studies due to its adaptability. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a genetic resource for breeding programs and its resilience to environmental stress."
