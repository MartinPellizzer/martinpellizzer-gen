It is characterized by its narrow, curling leaves and clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is closely related to other hyacinth species. Its bulbs are adapted for storing nutrients, allowing it to survive in temperate climates. Hyacinthus curvifolius is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and floral arrangements."
