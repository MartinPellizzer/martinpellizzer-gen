    "intro": "Hyperacanthus pervillei, commonly known as the Perville's spurge, is a perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
