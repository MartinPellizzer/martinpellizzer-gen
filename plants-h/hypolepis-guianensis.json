    "intro": "Hypolepis guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan shield fern, is a species of fern native to South America. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds with a shield-like shape. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rainforests and humid woodlands. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are usually divided into segments with a unique, almost segmented appearance that aids in its identification."
