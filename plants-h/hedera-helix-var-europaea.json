    "intro": "Hedera helix var. europaea, commonly known as the European ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Its adaptability makes it a common garden plant, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
