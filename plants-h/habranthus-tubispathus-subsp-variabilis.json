    "intro": "Habranthus tubispathus subsp. variabilis, commonly known as the variable tuberous bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tuberous roots and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its foliage consists of strap-like leaves, and it produces clusters of white or pale yellow blooms. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
