    "intro": "Hieracium pyrrhanthes subsp. laevisquamum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically smooth and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
