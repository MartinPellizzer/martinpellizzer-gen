    "intro": "Haworthia nigra var. elongata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green leaves with a distinctive white or pale stripe running along the central axis. The plant produces small, white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
