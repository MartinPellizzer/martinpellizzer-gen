    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pawlowskiellum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium species, often resulting from cross-pollination between different parental forms. The plant typically features bright yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with slender, hairy stems and serrated leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variation."
