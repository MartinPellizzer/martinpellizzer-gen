    "intro": "Halocarpus, commonly known as the coastal daisy or k\u014dwhai k\u014dhanga, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is native to New Zealand and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and small, often white or yellow flowers. The plants are adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Halocarpus species typically have woody stems and are often found in coastal dunes or rocky habitats. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for native wildlife."
