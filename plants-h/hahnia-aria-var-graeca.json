    "intro": "Hahnia aria var. graeca, commonly known as the Greek hare's foot, is a succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a rosette of fleshy, pale green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its drought tolerance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid climates."
