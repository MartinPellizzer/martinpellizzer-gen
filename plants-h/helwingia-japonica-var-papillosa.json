It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on the underside, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early spring, followed by clusters of red, berry-like fruits that attract birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and unique fruiting display."
