It typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. The plant has basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers. It produces small, oval-shaped achenes that are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
