    "intro": "Huperzia indica, commonly known as the Indian clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces small, spirally arranged leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a leathery texture. Huperzia indica is notable for its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila at the tips of the stems. This plant is often found in tropical and subtropical regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
