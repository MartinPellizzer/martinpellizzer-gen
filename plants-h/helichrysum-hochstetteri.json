    "intro": "Helichrysum hochstetteri, commonly known as the golden marguerite, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble small sunflowers, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The plant's ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
