It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. Hydrocotyle valida is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing wetland habitats."
