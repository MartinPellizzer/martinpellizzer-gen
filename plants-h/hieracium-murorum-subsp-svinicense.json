    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. svinicense, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disk. This subspecies is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
