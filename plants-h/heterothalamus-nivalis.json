    "intro": "Heterothalamus nivalis, commonly known as the snow thamnos, is a rare alpine plant found in high-altitude environments. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh climatic conditions. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, aiding in water retention and insulation. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, appearing in clusters during the short summer season. Heterothalamus nivalis plays a vital role in alpine ecosystems, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for specialized invertebrates."
