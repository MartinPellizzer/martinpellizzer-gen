    "intro": "Hyobanche fulleri, commonly known as the Indian milkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia, including India and Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it can photosynthesize but also derives some nutrients from its host plants. Hyobanche fulleri is often found in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges."
