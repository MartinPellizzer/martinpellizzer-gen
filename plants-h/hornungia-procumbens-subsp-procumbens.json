    "intro": "Hornungia procumbens subsp. procumbens, commonly known as the creeping hornungia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It typically forms dense mats of prostrate stems covered with fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are linear, sharply pointed, and often covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates with long winters."
