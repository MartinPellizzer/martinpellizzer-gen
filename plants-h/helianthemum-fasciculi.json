    "intro": "Helianthemum fasciculi, commonly known as the clustered stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves that are arranged in dense clusters, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
