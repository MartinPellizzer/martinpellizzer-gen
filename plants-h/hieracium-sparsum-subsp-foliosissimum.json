    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. foliosissimum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typically lobed and serrated. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some regions."
