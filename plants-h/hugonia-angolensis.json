    "intro": "Hugonia angolensis, commonly known as the Angola marshmallow, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with opposite, heart-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in loose inflorescences, usually white or pale pink, and bloom during the wet season. Hugonia angolensis is known for its mucilaginous sap, which has been traditionally used in herbal medicine."
