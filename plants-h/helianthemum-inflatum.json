    "intro": "Helianthemum inflatum, commonly known as the inflated stonecrop, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helianthemum inflatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and low maintenance requirements."
