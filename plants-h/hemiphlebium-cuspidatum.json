    "intro": "Hemiphlebium cuspidatum, commonly known as the sword fern, is a species of evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its sword-shaped, dark green fronds that are often adorned with small, pointed spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the substrate while absorbing nutrients. Hemiphlebium cuspidatum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
