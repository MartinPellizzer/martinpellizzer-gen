    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. lanatum, commonly known as the hairy hogweed, is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are typical of theApiaceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant that should be handled with care."
