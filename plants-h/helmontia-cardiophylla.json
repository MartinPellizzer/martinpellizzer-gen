    "intro": "Helmontia cardiophylla, commonly known as the heartleaf helmontia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, adding a subtle beauty to its habitat. It thrives in shaded, moist conditions and is often found near stagnant water bodies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
