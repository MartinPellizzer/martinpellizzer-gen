    "intro": "Hieracium holmiense, commonly known as Holm's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium holmiense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
