    "intro": "Heliconia secunda var. secunda, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, elongated inflorescence composed of brightly colored, spiral-arranged bracts. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in tropical gardens and as a component in floral arrangements."
