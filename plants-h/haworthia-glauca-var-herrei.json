It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
