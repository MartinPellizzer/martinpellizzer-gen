    "intro": "Helictotrichon mongolicum, commonly known as Mongolian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the steppes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to temperate climates. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictotrichon mongolicum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects."
