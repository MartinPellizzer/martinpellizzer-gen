    "intro": "Helicostylis lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved helicostylis, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its grass-like appearance, with slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest understories. Helicostylis lancifolia plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms in its native range."
