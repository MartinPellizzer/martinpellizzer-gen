It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. The leaves are elliptical, with translucent dots that give the plant its scientific name, \"perforatum.\" It produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are attractive to pollinators. This variety is often used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported antidepressant properties."
