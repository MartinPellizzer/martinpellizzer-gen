    "intro": "Helictotrichon hirtifolium, commonly known as the hairy leaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. It produces small, pale blue to purple flower clusters in the summer, which are borne on slender stalks. Helictotrichon hirtifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining ecological balance in grassland ecosystems."
