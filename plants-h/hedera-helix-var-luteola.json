    "intro": "Hedera helix var. luteola, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits striking yellow variegation on its leaves. This plant is a climbing vine native to Europe and is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded environments. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture and a distinctive yellow-green coloration. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark berries, though it is primarily cultivated for its ornamental foliage. Due to its slow growth and adaptability, it is a popular choice for indoor and outdoor landscaping."
