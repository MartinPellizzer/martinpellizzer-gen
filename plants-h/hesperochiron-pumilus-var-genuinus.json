    "intro": "Hesperochiron pumilus var. genuinus, commonly known as the dwarf moonflower, is a rare and delicate species of flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its small, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically green when immature and turn red upon ripening. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
