    "intro": "Huperzia underwoodiana, commonly known as the Underwood's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, forming clumps of upright, needle-like leaves. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia underwoodiana plays a role in stabilizing soil in forest understories and is often found in rich, acidic soils."
