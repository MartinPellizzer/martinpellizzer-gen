    "intro": "Hierochloe bungeana, commonly known as Bunge's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, forest edges, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. Its inflorescence consists of a spikelet cluster, with small, blue-green flowers that bloom in early summer. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
