    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. toutonii, commonly known as the bifid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, bifid (two-lobed) leaves and its preference for moist, calcareous soils. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along streambanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
