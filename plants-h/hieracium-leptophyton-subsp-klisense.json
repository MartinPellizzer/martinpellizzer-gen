    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. klisense, commonly known as the Klisenese hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Europe, particularly in the Carpathian Basin. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and localized species."
