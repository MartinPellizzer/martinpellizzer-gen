It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and hairy stems adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert ecosystems. Its unique morphology includes specialized leaves that reduce water loss, making it well-suited for its extreme habitat. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for botanical research."
