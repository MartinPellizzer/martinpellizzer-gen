    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 latisquamum subsp. acrocladium, commonly known as the broad-scaled hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive, broad, overlapping leaf blades that give it its common name. The plant typically produces yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
