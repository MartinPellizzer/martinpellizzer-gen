    "intro": "Hieracium ramondii subsp. chamaecerinthe, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically forms dense mats of foliage with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in grassy areas, woodland edges, and disturbed soils. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference compared to other Hieracium species."
