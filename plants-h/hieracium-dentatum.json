    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum, commonly known as the toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
