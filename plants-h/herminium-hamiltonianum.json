    "intro": "Herminium hamiltonianum, commonly known as the Hamilton's lady's-tongue, is a perennial orchid native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
