    "intro": "Hylaeaicum stoloniferum, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a sprawling growth habit, characterized by stolons that root at the nodes and form dense mats. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, depending on the water level. Small, greenish-white flowers emerge on slender stalks, typically in early summer. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing shoreline soils and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
