    "intro": "Haplodiscus vernicosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a fleshy, bumpy capsule that aids in seed dispersal. Haplodiscus vernicosus is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in some areas."
