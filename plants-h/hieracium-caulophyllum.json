    "intro": "Hieracium caulophyllum, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in sunny conditions. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat hairy. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in pollinator support."
