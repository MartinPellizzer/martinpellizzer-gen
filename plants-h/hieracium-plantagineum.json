    "intro": "Hieracium plantagineum, commonly known as the common groundsel, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it has spread to other parts of the world and is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas. The plant produces a large number of seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It is considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
