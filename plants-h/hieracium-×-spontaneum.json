    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 spontaneum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of the genus Hieracium. This plant is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. It is an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land managers."
