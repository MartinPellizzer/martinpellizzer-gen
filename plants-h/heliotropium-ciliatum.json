    "intro": "Heliotropium ciliatum, commonly known as the woolly heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its soft, hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white to grayish pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and wastelands. Heliotropium ciliatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
