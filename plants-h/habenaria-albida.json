    "intro": "Habenaria albida, commonly known as the white marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form colonies. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a hardy and adaptable plant."
