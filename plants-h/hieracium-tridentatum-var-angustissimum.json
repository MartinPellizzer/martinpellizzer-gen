    "intro": "Hieracium tridentatum var. angustissimum, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers in the summer. The plant is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
