    "intro": "Huidobria, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in various colors such as red, yellow, and orange. The plants typically have hairy, fleshy leaves and produce capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds. Huidobria species are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, often with deep root systems and thick cuticles to reduce water loss. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
