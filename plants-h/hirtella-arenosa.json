    "intro": "Hirtella arenosa, commonly known as the sand hirtella, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a rough texture. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the dry season. Its adaptability to sandy and well-drained soils makes it a common sight in coastal dunes and scrublands. Hirtella arenosa plays a role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
