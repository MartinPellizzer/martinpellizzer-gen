    "intro": "Hieracium comophyllum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium comophyllum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
