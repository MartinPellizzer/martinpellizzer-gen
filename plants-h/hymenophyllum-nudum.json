    "intro": "Hymenophyllum nudum, commonly known as the naked fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum nudum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
