    "intro": "Hedyotis megalantha, commonly known as the large-leaved dotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Hedyotis megalantha is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties."
