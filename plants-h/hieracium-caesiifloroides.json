It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and its showy, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
