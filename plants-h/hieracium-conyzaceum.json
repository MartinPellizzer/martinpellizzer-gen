    "intro": "Hieracium conyzaceum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium conyzaceum is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
