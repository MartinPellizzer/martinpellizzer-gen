It features small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
