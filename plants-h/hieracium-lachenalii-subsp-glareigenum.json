    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. glareigenum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense cushions or mats to withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow, consisting of ray florets surrounded by a central disk. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ability to produce a large number of seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
