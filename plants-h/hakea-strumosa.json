    "intro": "Hakea strumosa, commonly known as the red hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. Hakea strumosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
