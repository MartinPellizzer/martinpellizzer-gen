    "intro": "Hoffmannia boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian Hoffmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves, which are often covered in fine, soft hairs.

Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hoffmannia boliviana is considered a rare and endangered species."
