    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are hairy and have a rough texture, with the leaves becoming progressively smaller as they ascend the stem. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are surrounded by bracts. The subspecies is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the Hieracium genus."
