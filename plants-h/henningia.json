    "intro": "Henningia, commonly known as the \"Brazilian orchid\" or \"henningia orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often resemble those of true orchids. The plants typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, thriving on tree bark or rocky surfaces. Henningia species are known for their intricate floral structures and vibrant colors, which attract specific pollinators. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, many species within this genus are now considered endangered."
