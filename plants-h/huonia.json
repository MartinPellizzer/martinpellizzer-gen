It is characterized by its evergreen foliage and small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and Japan. Huonia species often thrive in cool, moist environments and are adapted to acidic soils. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and shaded landscapes."
