    "intro": "Hieracium falcatum subsp. falcatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a mat-forming growth habit, characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a dense cluster at the end of each stem. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a distinctive wavy or serrated edge. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadside areas, and along riverbanks."
