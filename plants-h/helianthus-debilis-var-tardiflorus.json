    "intro": "Helianthus debilis var. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom later in the growing season compared to other sunflower species. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, and has adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and slightly hairy. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
