It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky outcrops. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Hemionitis vooshvazool is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
