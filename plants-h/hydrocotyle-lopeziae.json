It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its glossy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Hydrocotyle lopeziae thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest for horticulturists and botanists alike."
