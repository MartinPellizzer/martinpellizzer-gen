    "intro": "Hieracium horridum var. genuinum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Its hairy stems and leaves give it a distinctive, rugged appearance."
