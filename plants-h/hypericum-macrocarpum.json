    "intro": "Hypericum macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are followed by orange-red, fleshy capsules containing numerous seeds. Its leaves and flowers contain hypericin and pseudohypericin, compounds known for their phototoxic properties. The plant is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soil."
