    "intro": "Heterocentron chimalapanum, commonly known as the Chimalapan cholla, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are typically covered in spines and are often branched. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are reduced to tubercles, a common adaptation in arid environments. Heterocentron chimalapanum is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient plant in its native range."
