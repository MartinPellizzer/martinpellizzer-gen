    "intro": "Hymenocoleus nervopilosus var. orientalis, commonly known as the oriental hair-veined fern, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely veined fronds that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the propagation of the species. The leaves are bioluminescent, a unique feature that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
