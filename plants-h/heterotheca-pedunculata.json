    "intro": "Heterotheca pedunculata, commonly known as the plains blueweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as prairies and sandy soils, and it is often found in the central and western United States. It produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are narrow and hairy. The plant is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinator populations."
