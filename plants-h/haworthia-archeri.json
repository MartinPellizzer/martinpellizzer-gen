    "intro": "Haworthia archeri, commonly known as the Zulu bulb, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, tubular white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haworthia archeri is well-suited for rock gardens or container cultivation due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
