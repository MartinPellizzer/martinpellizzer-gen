    "intro": "Holothrix parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved holothrix, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, silky pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. Holothrix parvifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
