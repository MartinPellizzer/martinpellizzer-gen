It is characterized by its rosette growth habit and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa, it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
