    "intro": "Haageocereus multangularis var. dichromus, commonly known as the dichromus cactus, is a species native to the deserts of northern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are ribbed and covered in clusters of small, white to pale blue spines. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements make it a distinctive addition to arid landscapes."
