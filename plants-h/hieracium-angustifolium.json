    "intro": "Hieracium angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal head. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early summer, and it is characterized by its lack of a central stem. Hieracium angustifolium is part of the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
