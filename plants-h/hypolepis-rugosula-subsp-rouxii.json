    "intro": "Hypolepis rugosula subsp. rouxii, commonly known as the rugged shield fern, is a fern species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and have a rough, textured surface. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in its natural habitat."
