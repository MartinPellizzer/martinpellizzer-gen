    "intro": "Hydrocharis morsus-ranae subsp. vivipara, commonly known as the water frog plant or aquatic frog plant, is a submerged aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, though they may emerge slightly above the water surface. It is notable for its viviparous reproduction, where the fruits develop underwater and release free-swimming embryos. This subspecies thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes."
