    "intro": "Heliconia spathocircinata subsp. panamensis, commonly known as the Panama heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are used to attract pollinators. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are typically visited by hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps reduce water loss. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests and along riverbanks."
