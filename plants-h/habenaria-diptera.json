    "intro": "Habenaria diptera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features long, slender stems with oval-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish or pale yellow flowers clustered in a spike. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ecological role in wetland ecosystems and its ornamental appeal in botanical gardens."
