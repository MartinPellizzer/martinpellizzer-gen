    "intro": "Habenaria keyensis, commonly known as the Key Island orchid, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the Bahamas and the Florida Keys. It is a terrestrial orchid with a compact growth habit, featuring a pseudobulb and a single, often hairy leaf. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and yellow, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the sandy soils of its coastal habitat. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
