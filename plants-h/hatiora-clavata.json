    "intro": "Hatiora clavata, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a popular epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its segmented stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant typically produces clusters of bright red, orange, or yellow flowers during the holiday season, which is why it is often associated with Christmas. Its leaves are modified into flattened, fleshy structures that store water, and it thrives in bright, indirect light with moderate humidity. Hatiora clavata is relatively easy to care for, making it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
