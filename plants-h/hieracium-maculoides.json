    "intro": "Hieracium maculoides, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough texture and often have a reddish or purplish hue. Hieracium maculoides is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
