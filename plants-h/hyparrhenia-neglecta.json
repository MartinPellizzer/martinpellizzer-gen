It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bluish-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often hidden within the foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping.
