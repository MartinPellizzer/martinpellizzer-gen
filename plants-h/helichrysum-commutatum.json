    "intro": "Helichrysum commutatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming, giving it a dried flower appearance. The plant is often found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its foliage is typically gray-green with a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. It is widely cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its long-lasting blooms and ornamental value."
