    "intro": "Helicophyllum lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's helicophyllum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in umbels. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
