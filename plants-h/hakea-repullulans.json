    "intro": "Hakea repullulans, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds when dry. Hakea repullulans is often found in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in full sun."
