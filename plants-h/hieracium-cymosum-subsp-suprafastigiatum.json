    "intro": "Hieracium cymosum subsp. suprafastigiatum, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, flat shape. This subspecies is distinguished by its more upright growth habit compared to other hawkweed species."
