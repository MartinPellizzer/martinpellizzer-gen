    "intro": "Hypoestes laeta, commonly known as the \"Snowflake Plant,\" is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bi-colored leaves that often feature a white or cream pattern against a green background. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hypoestes laeta is also valued for its ability to purify the air and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
