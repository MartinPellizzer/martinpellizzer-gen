    "intro": "Hedera fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy dark green leaves with a distinctive aromatic scent when crushed. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by red berries that attract birds. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management."
