    "intro": "Hieracium breviramum, commonly known as the short-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has basal leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a short, upright stem supporting its yellowish flower heads. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
