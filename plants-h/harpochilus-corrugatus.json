    "intro": "Harpochilus corrugatus, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped stems and lanceolate leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose inflorescence, which bloom during the dry season. Harpochilus corrugatus thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
