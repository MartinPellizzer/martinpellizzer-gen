    "intro": "Hymenocentron, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plants are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. They typically grow in wetland or aquatic environments, with some species being fully submerged. Hymenocentron species are often used in ornamental horticulture due to their vibrant blooms and adaptability to water-based habitats."
