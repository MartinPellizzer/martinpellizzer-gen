It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, branching structure. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, it thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized stalks, which release spores for reproduction. Its slow growth and unique morphology make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
