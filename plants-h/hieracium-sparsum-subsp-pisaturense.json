It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clustered inflorescences, often with a distinctive central stem. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in disturbed areas."
