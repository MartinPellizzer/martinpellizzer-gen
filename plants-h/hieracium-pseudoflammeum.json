    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoflammeum, commonly known as the flameless hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. It is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its smaller size and less vibrant coloration."
