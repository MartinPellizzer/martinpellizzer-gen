    "intro": "Helianthus mandonii, commonly known as the Mandon's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller florets, typical of the genus Helianthus. Its leaves are usually hairy and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. Helianthus mandonii is often found in rocky soils and is a characteristic plant of desert scrub habitats."
