It features striking blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in habitats with high water tables. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its role in local ecosystems."
