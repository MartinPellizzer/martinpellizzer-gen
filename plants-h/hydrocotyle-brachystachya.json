    "intro": "Hydrocotyle brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water plantain, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, ponds, and along stream edges. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged. Its small, white flowers appear in clusters and bloom in late summer. Hydrocotyle brachystachya plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
