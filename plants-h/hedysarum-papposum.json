    "intro": "Hedysarum papposum, commonly known as the common milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces pods that contain feathery seeds, which are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Hedysarum papposum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment."
