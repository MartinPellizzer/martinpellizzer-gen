    "intro": "Henrya insularis, commonly known as the island henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage with a velvety texture, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in compact inflorescences. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense, compact mats. Henrya insularis is relatively slow-growing and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot."
