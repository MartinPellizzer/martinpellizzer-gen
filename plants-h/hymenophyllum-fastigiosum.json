    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fastigiosum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in specialized structures called sorus. The plant's intricate morphology and preference for moist habitats make it a notable example of epiphytic ferns."
