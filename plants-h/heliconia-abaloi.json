It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence composed of bright red bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Heliconia abaloi thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or near water sources. It is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its role in supporting local ecosystems and wildlife."
