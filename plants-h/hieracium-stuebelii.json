    "intro": "Hieracium stuebelii, commonly known as Stuebel's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow, often arranged in a single head. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
