    "intro": "Helicodea leopoldii, commonly known as the Leopold's helicodea, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
