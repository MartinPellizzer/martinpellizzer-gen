    "intro": "Haworthia pseudotessellata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, leafy succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with distinctive white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
