    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This variety is distinguished by the presence of small, dark spots on its leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
