    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. koserovense, commonly known as the Koserovian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus. It thrives in dry, grassy habitats and is often found in open areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic plant in its native range."
