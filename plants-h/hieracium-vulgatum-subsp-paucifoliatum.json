    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. paucifoliatum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, often hairy leaves, and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its reduced foliage, with only a few leaves per stem, giving it its subspecies name \"paucifoliatum.\" The flowers are clustered in a single head, and the plant is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
