    "intro": "Haworthia picturata, commonly known as the picturata Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically bluish-green with white or pale green markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, waxy cuticle that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
