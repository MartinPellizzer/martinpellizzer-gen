It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five-lobed and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers followed by red, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
