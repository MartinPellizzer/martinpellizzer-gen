    "intro": "Hemipilia thailandica, commonly known as the Thai orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, and prefers well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hemipilia thailandica is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its cultural significance in traditional medicine."
