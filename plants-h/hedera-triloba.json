    "intro": "Hedera triloba, commonly known as the three-lobed ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically three-lobed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera triloba thrives in shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
