    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. sublineatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the stems are often reddish and somewhat hairy. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
