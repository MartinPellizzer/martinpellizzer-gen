    "intro": "Hibiscus furcellatus var. scaber, commonly known as the roughleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, flat seeds. Hibiscus furcellatus var. scaber is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
