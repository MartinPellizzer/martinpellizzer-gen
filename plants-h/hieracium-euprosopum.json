    "intro": "Hieracium euprosopum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc, and its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium euprosopum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
