    "intro": "Hieracium impexidens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Hieracium impexidens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
