It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are generally lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
