    "intro": "Hakea plurinervia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hakea plurinervia is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
