    "intro": "Helminthia lusitanica var. subinervis, commonly known as the Lusitanian helminthia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to parts of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
