    "intro": "Habenaria dauphinensis, commonly known as the Dauphine orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, spurred flowers that typically bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
