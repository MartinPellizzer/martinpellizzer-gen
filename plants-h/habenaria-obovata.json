It is characterized by its obovate, dark green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy flowers in shades of white and pink, with a distinctive spurred lip. It typically grows in shaded, humid environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it a popular subject for both horticultural cultivation and botanical study."
