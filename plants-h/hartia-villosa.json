    "intro": "Hartia villosa, commonly known as the hairy hartia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Africa. It features slender, hairy stems that often grow in clusters, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Hartia villosa is typically found in grasslands and rocky habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
