    "intro": "Hieracium arolae subsp. macrocalathium, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a dominant species in its habitat. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are typically hairy and somewhat woody at the base. This subspecies is known for its ecological impact, as it can form dense stands that outcompete native vegetation in certain environments."
