    "intro": "Helleborine palustris lusus violacea, commonly known as the purple marsh helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as bogs and marshes, where it thrives in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
