    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has a compact growth habit with wiry stems and dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Its leaves are usually covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, coastal or mountainous regions."
