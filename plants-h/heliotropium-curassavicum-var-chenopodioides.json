    "intro": "Heliotropium curassavicum var. chenopodioides, commonly known as the sea heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its leaves are typically succulent and covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. This species is often used in coastal restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize dunes and tolerate harsh maritime conditions."
