    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. fagetanum, commonly known as the Faget's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features bright yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which is characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, with basal leaves being more elongated. This subspecies is distinguished by its specific geographic distribution and subtle morphological differences from other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
