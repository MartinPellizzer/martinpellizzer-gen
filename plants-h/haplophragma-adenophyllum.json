    "intro": "Haplophragma adenophyllum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic invertebrates. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are often submerged, while its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually emerging above the water surface. Haplophragma adenophyllum is adapted to nutrient-poor environments, using its specialized structures to obtain nutrients from captured prey."
