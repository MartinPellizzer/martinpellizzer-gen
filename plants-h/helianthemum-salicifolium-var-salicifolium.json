The plant has slender, willow-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in marginal garden conditions."
