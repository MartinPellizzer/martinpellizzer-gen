    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. semiplanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and relatively small, yellowish composite flowers. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its low-growing form and adaptability, it is often found in nutrient-poor soils."
