    "intro": "Hieracium sathranthum, commonly known as the sand thistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and bright yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open areas such as coastal dunes or disturbed sites. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium sathranthum is often considered a weed but can play a role in stabilizing soils in arid environments."
