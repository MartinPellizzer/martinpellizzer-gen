    "intro": "Haworthia mirabilis var. heidelbergensis, commonly known as the Heidelberg Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
