    "intro": "Haynaldia villosa var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth haynaldia, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Its seeds are enclosed in pods and are adapted for dispersal by wind or animals. The smooth, glabrous leaves of this variety distinguish it from other variants of Haynaldia villosa."
