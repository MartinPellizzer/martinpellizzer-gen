    "intro": "Habenaria physoplectra, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its distinctive inflorescence of pale pink to white flowers arranged in a dense, thread-like cluster. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the soil, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination and growth. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in forest ecosystems."
