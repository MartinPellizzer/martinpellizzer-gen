It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
