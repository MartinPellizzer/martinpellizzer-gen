    "intro": "Hedysarum sachalinense subsp. austrokurilense, commonly known as the Kuril milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
