It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils.
