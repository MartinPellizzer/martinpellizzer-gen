    "intro": "Howea, commonly known as the palm tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Arecaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of the South Pacific, including parts of Australia, New Caledonia, and the Cook Islands. Howea species are characterized by their tall, slender trunks and large, feather-like leaves that grow in a rosette pattern. They are often cultivated as ornamental plants due to their aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. The flowers of Howea are typically small and clustered, producing fruits that contain edible seeds."
