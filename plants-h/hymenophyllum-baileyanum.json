    "intro": "Hymenophyllum baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileyanum moss, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its intricate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, cushion-like formations on the underside of its leaves. This species is notable for its high degree of morphological variation and is often used in horticultural settings for its ornamental value."
