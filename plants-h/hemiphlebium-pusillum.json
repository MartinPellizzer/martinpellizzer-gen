    "intro": "Hemiphlebium pusillum, commonly known as the silver lace fern, is a striking evergreen fern native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features delicate, lacy fronds that are typically dark green with a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant grows in shaded, moist environments and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to spread slowly through vegetative reproduction. Hemiphlebium pusillum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, humid conditions."
