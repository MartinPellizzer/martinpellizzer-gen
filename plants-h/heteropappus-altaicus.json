    "intro": "Heteropappus altaicus, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces yellow to orange composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Heteropappus altaicus is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and low precipitation, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
