    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. amauranthum, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and its showy, orange-yellow composite flowers. The plant produces a single, terminal flower head that consists of both ray and disc florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing roadsides and meadows. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
