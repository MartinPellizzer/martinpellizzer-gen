    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. amaurobasis, commonly known as the black-leaf groundsel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. The plant features dark green, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. Its subspecific name, *amaurobasis*, refers to its dark-colored leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the genus. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
