    "intro": "Huernia campanulata, commonly known as the bell-shaped African hatplant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are often ribbed and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with a red or purple throat. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
