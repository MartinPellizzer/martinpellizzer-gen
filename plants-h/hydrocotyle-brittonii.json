    "intro": "Hydrocotyle brittonii, commonly known as the Britton's water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. Its flowers are tiny, greenish-white, and clustered in umbels, which are characteristic of the Araliaceae family. Hydrocotyle brittonii plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
