    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. tanycladum, commonly known as the dark hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its dark green, woolly leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a robust root system and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats. Its botanical features make it distinct from other hawkweed species, particularly in leaf morphology and flower structure."
