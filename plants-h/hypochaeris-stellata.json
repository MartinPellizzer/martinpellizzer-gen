The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm and has a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and alternate. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, similar to other members of the dandelion genus. Hypochaeris stellata is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils, and it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
