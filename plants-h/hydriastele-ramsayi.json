    "intro": "Hydriastele ramsayi, commonly known as the Ramsay's hydriastele, is a rare and striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, where it thrives in shaded, humid environments. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that hold water, creating a small pool that supports a variety of microorganisms and insects. Its flowers, which are usually yellow or orange, are borne on tall, slender stalks and are highly attractive to pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
