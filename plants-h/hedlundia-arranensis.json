    "intro": "Hedlundia arranensis, commonly known as the Arran bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Isle of Arran in Scotland. It is a flowering plant belonging to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or scrub habitats. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
