It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
