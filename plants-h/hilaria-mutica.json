    "intro": "Hilaria mutica, commonly known as the rough muhly, is a perennial grass species native to the Americas. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies, rocky slopes, and sandy soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a rough texture, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late summer. Hilaria mutica is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas."
