    "intro": "Hedyotis puberula, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a small herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it its common name. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed seeds. Hedyotis puberula is often found in wetland habitats and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
