    "intro": "Hedysarum deltoides, commonly known as the eastern peavine, is a perennial legume native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, winding stems that often climb or trail along the ground. Its seeds are enclosed in pods that mature into a reddish-brown color, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hedysarum deltoides plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
