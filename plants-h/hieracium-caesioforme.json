    "intro": "Hieracium caesioforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are bright yellow with a central disk. Hieracium caesioforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
