    "intro": "Hesperis renifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf candytuft, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-gray leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun. It is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Hesperis renifolia is a perennial species that is relatively low-maintenance and drought-tolerant once established."
