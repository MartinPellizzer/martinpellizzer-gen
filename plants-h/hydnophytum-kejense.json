    "intro": "Hydnophytum kejense, commonly known as the kejense mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that grows on the branches of trees in the rainforests of Borneo. It has a unique symbiotic relationship with its host, deriving some of its nutrients through specialized roots that attach to the host's vascular system. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers, followed by fleshy, berry-like fruits that are important for local wildlife. It is classified as a member of the Loranthaceae family, which includes other mistletoe species. Due to habitat loss, Hydnophytum kejense is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
