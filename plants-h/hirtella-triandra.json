    "intro": "Hirtella triandra, commonly known as the Brazilian wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Hirtella triandra is also valued for its ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it suitable for woodland gardens."
