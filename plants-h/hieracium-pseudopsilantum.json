    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopsilantum, commonly known as the false sand sedge, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as meadows and coastal dunes. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
