    "intro": "Habenaria flaccifolia, commonly known as the flaccid lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a dense, spiraled inflorescence of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is known for its delicate, ephemeral blooms that often appear in late spring. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
