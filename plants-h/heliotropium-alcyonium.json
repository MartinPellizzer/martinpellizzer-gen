    "intro": "Heliotropium alcyonium, commonly known as the sea heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils near the shoreline. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a distinctive scent. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in salty environments. Heliotropium alcyonium is well adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
