    "intro": "Helichrysum sibthorpii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces numerous tiny, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, which helps in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
