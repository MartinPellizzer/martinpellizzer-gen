    "intro": "Hymenophyllum spinosum, commonly known as the spiny shield fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often covered with tiny, scale-like structures. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of its fronds in clusters known as sori. Hymenophyllum spinosum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
