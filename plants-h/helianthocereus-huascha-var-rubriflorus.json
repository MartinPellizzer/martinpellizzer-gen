It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems and produces large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically deep red or orange, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. This cactus thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to desert gardens and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
