    "intro": "Hoya halophila, commonly known as the saltbush hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Hoya halophila is a succulent, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xerophytic gardens. Its ability to thrive in saline soils makes it a unique species adapted to coastal areas."
