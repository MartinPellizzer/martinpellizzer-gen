    "intro": "Hakea funicularis, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in terminal spikes, which attract nectar-feeding insects and birds. It thrives in coastal environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Hakea funicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
