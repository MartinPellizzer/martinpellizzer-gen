    "intro": "Hymenanthera latifolia var. chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island hakea, is a shrub native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It is characterized by its woody structure, narrow lance-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain several seeds. It is adapted to the cool, maritime climate of its native habitat and is often found in coastal scrub or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
