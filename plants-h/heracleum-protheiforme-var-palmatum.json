    "intro": "Heracleum protheiforme var. palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in complex umbels, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to East Asia and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. Its foliage can cause skin irritation due to the presence of furanocoumarins. It is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
