    "intro": "Hedysarum esculentum, commonly known as the edible vetch, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It is a perennial legume that produces yellow flowers and small, edible pods containing seeds. The plant has trifoliate leaves and is often cultivated for its nutritious seeds, which are rich in protein. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid regions. Hedysarum esculentum plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
