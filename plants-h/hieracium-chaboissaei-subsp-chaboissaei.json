    "intro": "Hieracium chaboissaei subsp. chaboissaei, commonly known as the Chaboissai hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in open habitats such as slopes and grasslands. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its relatively small stature and distinctive leaf morphology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
