    "intro": "Hieracium sagittatum subsp. unctiusculum, commonly known as the sticky spearhead hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in grasslands, open woodlands, and disturbed soils, often in sunny locations. The plant features upright stems with rough, hairy surfaces, and its leaves are lanceolate, often with a waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive, elongated shape, and are arranged in a composite head. The subspecies is characterized by its sticky secretions on the leaves and stems, which help in deterring herbivores."
