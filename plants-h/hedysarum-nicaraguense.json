    "intro": "Hedysarum nicaraguense, commonly known as the Nicaraguan milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to Central America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a shallow root system and is adapted to thrive in arid or semi-arid environments. Hedysarum nicaraguense plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
