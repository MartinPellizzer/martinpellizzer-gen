    "intro": "Holoptelea integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf acacia, is a deciduous tree native to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its simple, entire leaves that are arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are grouped in clusters, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system that allows it to access groundwater. Holoptelea integrifolia is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its hard, durable wood."
