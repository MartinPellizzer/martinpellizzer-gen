    "intro": "Hymenophyllum wercklei, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its fronds are typically less than 10 centimeters in length, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum wercklei is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in moist, shaded forest areas."
