    "intro": "Harrisia pomanensis, commonly known as the Pomanesa cactus, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, spiny stems that grow in a shrub-like form, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are edible and have a sweet, tangy flavor. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom during the warmer months. Harrisia pomanensis is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its stems and performing photosynthesis through its green, fleshy tissue."
