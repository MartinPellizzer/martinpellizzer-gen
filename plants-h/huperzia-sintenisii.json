It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, linear leaves that form a compact rosette. The plant typically grows on rocky substrates and in shaded, humid environments. It produces sporangia in clusters at the base of its leaves, which are released during the wet season. Huperzia sintenisii is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
