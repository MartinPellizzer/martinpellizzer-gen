    "intro": "Hedera latifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant. Its adaptability to various soil types and tolerance to urban conditions make it a common ornamental species. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
