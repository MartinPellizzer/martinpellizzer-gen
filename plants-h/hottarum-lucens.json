    "intro": "Hottarum lucens, commonly known as the luminous flame orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant orange and yellow flowers, which emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant's leaves are narrow and sword-shaped, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires partial shade to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation concern."
