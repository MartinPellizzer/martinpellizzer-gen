    "intro": "Homalomena pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf swamp arrowhead, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, shady environments such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant has heart-shaped, arrowhead-like leaves that are usually dark green and glossy. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often emerging from the water or moist soil. Due to its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat, it is often cultivated in water gardens or as a houseplant in humid conditions."
