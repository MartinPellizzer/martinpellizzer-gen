    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. polygrammum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies polygrammum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
