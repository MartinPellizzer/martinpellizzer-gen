    "intro": "Halimium lepidotum var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of delicate, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
