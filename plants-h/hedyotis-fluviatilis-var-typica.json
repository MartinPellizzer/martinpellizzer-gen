    "intro": "Hedyotis fluviatilis var. typica, commonly known as the water inchplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and riparian habitats. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the edges of water bodies. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptical, and have a slightly hairy surface. Hedyotis fluviatilis var. typica is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other moist environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
