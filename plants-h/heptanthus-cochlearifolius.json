    "intro": "Heptanthus cochlearifolius, commonly known as the spiral-leaf heptanthus, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen shrub form. The plant is notable for its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in spring, and it produces berries that are edible for certain wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
