    "intro": "Hedera ramiflora, commonly known as the branching ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Hedera ramiflora thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a useful ornamental plant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
