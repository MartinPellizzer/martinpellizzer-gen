    "intro": "Hybanthus bilobus, commonly known as the two-lobed hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Hybanthusaceae and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces, and its flowering period occurs during the wet season. Hybanthus bilobus is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
