    "intro": "Himantoglossum longibracteatum, commonly known as the long-bract bellwether, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant produces long, narrow bracts that give it its common name and help protect its delicate inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
