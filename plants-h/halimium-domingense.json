    "intro": "Halimium domingense, commonly known as the Canary Island stonecrop, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Canary Islands. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its unique appearance and resilience, it is a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
