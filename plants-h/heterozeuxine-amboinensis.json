    "intro": "Heterozeuxine amboinensis, commonly known as the Amboina sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Maluku Islands of Indonesia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in traditional medicine and perfumery. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has simple, alternate leaves with a leathery texture. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its fruit is a small, woody drupe. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered an endangered species."
