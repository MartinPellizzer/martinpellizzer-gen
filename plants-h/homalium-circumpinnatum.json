    "intro": "Homalium circumpinnatum, commonly known as the broadleaf huito, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a striking green color. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
