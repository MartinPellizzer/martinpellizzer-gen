    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 pulverulentum var. velutinum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean climates."
