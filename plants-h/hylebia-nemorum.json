    "intro": "Hylebia nemorum, commonly known as the European wintergreen, is a small evergreen shrub native to the temperate forests of Europe. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and remain on the plant year-round, contributing to its evergreen nature. Hylebia nemorum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
