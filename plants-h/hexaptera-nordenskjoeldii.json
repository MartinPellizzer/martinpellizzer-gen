It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, willow-like leaves and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in harsh environments, such as tundra and rocky slopes, where it tolerates cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. Its woody stems and evergreen leaves help it survive the extreme climate of its habitat. Hexaptera nordenskjoeldii plays an important ecological role in providing food and shelter for various arctic wildlife species."
