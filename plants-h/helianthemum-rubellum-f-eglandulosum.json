It features dense clusters of small, bright orange-red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine, woolly pubescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes.
