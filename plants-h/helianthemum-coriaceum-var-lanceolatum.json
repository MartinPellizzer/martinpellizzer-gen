    "intro": "Helianthemum coriaceum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are lanceolate in shape, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a resilient addition to xeriscaped gardens."
