It produces dense clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers in early spring. The plant's leaves are narrow and grass-like, emerging from a basal rosette of leaves. Its flowers are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence, giving it its common name. Hyacinthus spicatus is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
