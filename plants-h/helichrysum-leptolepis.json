    "intro": "Helichrysum leptolepis, commonly known as the golden bush or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny sunbursts. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss. Helichrysum leptolepis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens and floral arrangements."
