    "intro": "Hypochaeris humilis, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically arranged in a cluster at the end of each stem. The plant has hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hypochaeris humilis is known for its ability to spread rapidly through self-seeding, making it both a common weed and a hardy ornamental plant."
