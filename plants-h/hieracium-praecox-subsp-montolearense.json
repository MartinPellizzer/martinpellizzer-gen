    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. montolearense, commonly known as the Montoleare hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow ray florets and short, upright stems that bear compact flower heads. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
