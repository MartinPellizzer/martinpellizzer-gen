It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features serrated, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.
