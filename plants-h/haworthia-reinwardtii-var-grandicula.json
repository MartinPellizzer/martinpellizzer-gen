It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings, which help reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
