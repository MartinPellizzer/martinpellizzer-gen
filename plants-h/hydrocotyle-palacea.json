    "intro": "Hydrocotyle palacea, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araceae. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, it thrives in moist, shady environments. Hydrocotyle palacea is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
