    "intro": "Hymenocallis adnata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spider lily, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, funnel-shaped white flowers with a prominent yellow throat, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves that are often mistaken for grasses, contributing to its camouflage in natural habitats. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Hymenocallis adnata is also notable for its ability to form clumps over time, enhancing its ornamental value in landscaped settings."
