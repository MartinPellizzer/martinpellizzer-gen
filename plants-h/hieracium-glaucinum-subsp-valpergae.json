    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. valpergae, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, rocky habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like inflorescence and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
