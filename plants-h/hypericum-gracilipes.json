    "intro": "Hypericum gracilipes, commonly known as slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, red-orange berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and horticultural use in shaded gardens."
