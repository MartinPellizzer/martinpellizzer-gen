    "intro": "Hoya pubens, commonly known as the wax plant or porcelain vine, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya pubens is a trailing plant that can grow both as a vine or a shrub, making it popular in hanging baskets or as a shelf plant. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, and is relatively easy to care for."
