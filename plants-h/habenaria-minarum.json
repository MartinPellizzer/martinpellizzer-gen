    "intro": "Habenaria minarum, commonly known as the mountain orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forest understories and mountainous regions. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few flowers that are usually white or pale pink in color. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. The orchid's morphology reflects its adaptation to low-light environments, with broad, leathery leaves that help retain moisture."
