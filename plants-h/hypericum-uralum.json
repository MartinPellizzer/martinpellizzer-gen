    "intro": "Hypericum uralum, commonly known as the Ural St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the cold regions of Eastern Europe and Siberia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant contains hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its distinctive red-orange coloration and have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
