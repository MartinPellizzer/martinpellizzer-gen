It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands across Europe and parts of Asia. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Hieracium orphnaeum is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
