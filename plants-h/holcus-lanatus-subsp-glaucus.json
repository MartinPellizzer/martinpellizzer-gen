    "intro": "Holcus lanatus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous bentgrass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive bluish-gray sheen due to the presence of a waxy coating. Its inflorescence consists of a single, spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings for its aesthetic qualities."
