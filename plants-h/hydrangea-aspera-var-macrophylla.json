    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera var. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter. The plant produces both sterile and fertile flowers, with the sterile ones being the showy blue or pink blooms that change color based on soil pH. Its leaves are large, ovate, and often have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, seasonal displays."
