    "intro": "Hibiscus grandidieri, commonly known as the Madagascar hibiscus, is a striking plant native to the island of Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter, with vibrant red or pink petals. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a waxy texture, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. Hibiscus grandidieri is also notable for its ability to produce a unique, fragrant seedpod that splits open when mature."
