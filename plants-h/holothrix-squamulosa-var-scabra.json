    "intro": "Holothrix squamulosa var. scabra, commonly known as the rough holothrix, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features dense, upright growth with fleshy, woolly leaves that are covered in a rough, scaly texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, adding a delicate contrast to its rugged foliage. It is well adapted to arid conditions, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements in dry climates."
