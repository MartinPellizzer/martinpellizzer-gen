    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum subsp. suffruticosum, commonly known as the rock rose of southern Italy, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy yellow flowers. It typically thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover. It is well adapted to dry conditions and requires minimal water once established."
