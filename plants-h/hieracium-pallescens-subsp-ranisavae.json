    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. ranisavae, commonly known as the pale hawkweed subspecies ranisavae, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves and yellow flower heads that bloom in the summer months. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy or disturbed habitats. It has a low-growing habit and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant species."
