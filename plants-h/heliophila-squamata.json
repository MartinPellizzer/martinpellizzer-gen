It is characterized by its small, white or pale yellow flowers and a dense covering of fine, silver hairs on its stems and leaves. Native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant is herbaceous, with a basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that rise above them. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens and a valuable plant for ecological studies."
