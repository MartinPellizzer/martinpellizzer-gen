    "intro": "Hosta tibae, commonly known as the Tibetan hosta, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of Tibet. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, usually in shades of white or pale yellow. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires partial to full shade to prevent leaf scorch. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hosta tibae is considered a conservation concern."
