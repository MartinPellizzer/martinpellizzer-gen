    "intro": "Hesperis maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray leaves, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found along shorelines and dunes. Its showy blooms appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hesperis maritima is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
