    "intro": "Heracleum pyrenaicum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It can grow up to 5 meters in height, with large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and large, coarse leaves. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
