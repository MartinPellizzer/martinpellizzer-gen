It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is often found in temperate climates. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. The subspecies pleiotrichum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly larger flower heads compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
