    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. bruhinianum, commonly known as the Br\u00fchn's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical sunflower-like appearance. The plant features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in moist or calcareous environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes protected species in certain regions."
