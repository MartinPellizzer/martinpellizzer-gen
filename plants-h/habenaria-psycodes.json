    "intro": "Habenaria psycodes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its pale green to white, strap-like leaves and its striking, hooded flower that resembles a ghostly face. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. It has a unique ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, rather than from soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
