    "intro": "Hesperis sylvestris, commonly known as the wild sweet rocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes mustard and cabbage plants. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly peppery aroma when crushed. Hesperis sylvestris is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it serves as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
