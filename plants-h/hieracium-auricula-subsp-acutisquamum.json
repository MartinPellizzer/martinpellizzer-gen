    "intro": "Hieracium auricula subsp. acutisquamum, commonly known as the sharp-scaled hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive, sharply toothed margin. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single, erect head, which is surrounded by a series of bracts. It thrives in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
