    "intro": "Hakea ctenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a hardy plant suitable for coastal and dry garden environments. Hakea ctenophylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscaping."
