    "intro": "Haloragis salsoloides, commonly known as the saltbush or coastal saltbush, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, often found in dune environments. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in arid conditions. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its salt tolerance makes it an important plant for stabilizing coastal ecosystems and preventing soil erosion."
