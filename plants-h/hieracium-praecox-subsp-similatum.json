It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it survive in various environmental conditions. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
