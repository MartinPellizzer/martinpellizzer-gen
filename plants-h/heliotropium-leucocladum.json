    "intro": "Heliotropium leucocladum, commonly known as white heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that often have a violet or white hue. The plant typically grows as a shrub or herb, with hairy stems and leaves that are often opposite in arrangement. Its flowers are known to open in response to sunlight, a trait called heliotropism, and it produces capsule fruits containing small, dry seeds. The plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its attractive foliage and flowering habit."
