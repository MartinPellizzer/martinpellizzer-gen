    "intro": "Humboltia aspera, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and thick, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Humboltia aspera is adapted to thrive in harsh, low-water conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
