    "intro": "Hofmeistera, commonly known as the dwarf cycad, is a genus of cycads native to Southeast Asia. These plants are characterized by their stout, unbranched stems and large, pinnate leaves that give them a distinctive appearance. Hofmeistera species are typically slow-growing and require well-draining soil and bright, indirect light to thrive. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and unique, ancient-looking foliage. Due to habitat loss, several species are considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival."
