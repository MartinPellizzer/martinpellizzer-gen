    "intro": "Hydrocotyle podantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has small, floating or submerged leaves that are usually oval to lance-shaped with a waxy surface. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal. Hydrocotyle podantha plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality maintenance."
