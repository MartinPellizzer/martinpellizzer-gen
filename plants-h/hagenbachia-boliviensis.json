    "intro": "Hagenbachia boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian hagenbachia, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
