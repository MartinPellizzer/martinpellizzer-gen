    "intro": "Heuchera novomexicana, commonly known as New Mexico alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, often variegated leaves that range in color from green to red and purple. The plant produces upright spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during the spring and early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and delicate blooms contribute to its value in both native and cultivated landscapes."
