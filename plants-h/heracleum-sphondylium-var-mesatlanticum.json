    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. mesatlanticum, commonly known as the lesser cowparsnip, is a biennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Due to its resemblance to more toxic members of the carrot family, it can be easily mistaken for poison hemlock, requiring careful identification."
