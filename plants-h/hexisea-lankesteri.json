    "intro": "Hexisea lankesteri, commonly known as the Lankester's sea hare, is a species of sea slug belonging to the family Anaspidae. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body and vibrant coloration, which can vary depending on its environment and diet. This marine gastropod is found in tropical and subtropical waters, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its anatomy includes a reduced shell and a muscular foot used for crawling along the ocean floor. The plant-like appearance of its body, with branching gills, gives it a unique botanical resemblance to certain algae and aquatic plants."
