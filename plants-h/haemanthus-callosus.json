    "intro": "Haemanthus callosus, commonly known as the Christmas bell, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features striking red-orange flowers that resemble bells, which appear in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy, whitish coating. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Haemanthus callosus is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance."
