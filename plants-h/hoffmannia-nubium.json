    "intro": "Hoffmannia nubium, commonly known as the clouded hoffmannia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hoffmannia nubium is considered a vulnerable species."
