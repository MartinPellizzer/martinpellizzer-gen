It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in racemes. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and often form a dense rosette near the ground. The species is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in its native habitats."
