    "intro": "Hamularia cornuta, commonly known as the horned bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet, often with a distinctive horn-like projection at the base. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hamularia cornuta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
