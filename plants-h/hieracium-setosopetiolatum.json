    "intro": "Hieracium setosopetiolatum, commonly known as the hairy-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
