    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium subsp. ledifolium, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in dry landscapes."
