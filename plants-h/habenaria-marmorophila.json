    "intro": "Habenaria marmorophila, commonly known as the marbled orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, mottled green and white petals that resemble marble. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often near streams or in mountainous regions. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinct three-lobed lip that is a key identifying feature. Habenaria marmorophila is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
