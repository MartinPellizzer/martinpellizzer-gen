    "intro": "Hymenophyllum turquinense, commonly known as the Turquin's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are borne on the underside of the fronds and are clustered in small, circular groups. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an important species in the study of epiphytic flora."
