    "intro": "Hypericum scioanum, commonly known as the yellow St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its woody stems covered in small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
