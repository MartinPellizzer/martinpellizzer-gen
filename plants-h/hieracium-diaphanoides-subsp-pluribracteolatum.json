    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. pluribracteolatum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its numerous bracts along the flowering stems, which give it its specific epithet. It typically grows in grassy areas and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
