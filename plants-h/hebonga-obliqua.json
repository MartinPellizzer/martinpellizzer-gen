    "intro": "Hebonga obliqua, commonly known as the narrowleaf lily, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Hebonga obliqua is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine by indigenous communities."
