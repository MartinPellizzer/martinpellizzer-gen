    "intro": "Habenaria keiskeoides, commonly known as the Keiske's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshes. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is known for its relatively small, clustered inflorescences. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
