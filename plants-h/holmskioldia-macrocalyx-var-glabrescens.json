    "intro": "Holmskioldia macrocalyx var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-flowered holmskioldia, is a variant of the holmskioldia species native to South America. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a smooth, waxy coating, which gives the plant its \"glabrescens\" designation. The flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This plant prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for garden cultivation."
