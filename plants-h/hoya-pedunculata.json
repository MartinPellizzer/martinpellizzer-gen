    "intro": "Hoya pedunculata, commonly known as the coral hoya, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, thick leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, which bloom during the warmer months. Hoya pedunculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
