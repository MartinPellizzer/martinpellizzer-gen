    "intro": "Henckelia dasycalyx, commonly known as the woolly calyx plant, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering on the calyx, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows as a shrub with simple, opposite leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in inflorescences that are borne on the stems. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and is often cultivated as a container plant."
