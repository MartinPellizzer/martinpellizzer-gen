    "intro": "Hampea montebellensis, commonly known as the Montebello hampea, is a flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are palmately lobed, and it produces capsules as its fruiting structure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
