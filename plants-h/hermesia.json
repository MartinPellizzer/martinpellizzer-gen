    "intro": "Hermesia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and southern Europe. They are characterized by their showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including red, orange, and yellow. Hermesia species are typically shrubs or small trees, adapted to survive in hot, dry environments. Their leaves are often small and succulent, helping to conserve water in harsh climates."
