    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. valdefoliatum, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often in the temperate climate zones. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are pale yellow to white, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through a process called cypselae dispersal."
