It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, sunny habitats. Herniaria scabrida is adapted to withstand drought and salt spray, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
