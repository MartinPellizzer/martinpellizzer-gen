    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pleiocarpum, commonly known as the many-fruited hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum pleiocarpum is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in humid, forested habitats."
