    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while the flowers consist of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
