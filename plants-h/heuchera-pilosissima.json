    "intro": "Heuchera pilosissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that ranges in color from deep purple to red and bronze. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers in late spring, which are clustered in upright panicles. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and ability to add texture and color to shaded landscapes."
