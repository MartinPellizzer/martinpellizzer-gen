    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the family Crambeae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and white, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. It is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing microhabitat for small organisms. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude environments."
