    "intro": "Huperzia blepharodes, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and is typically found in rocky or calcareous soils. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in strobila, a feature typical of many ferns. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Huperzia blepharodes is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
