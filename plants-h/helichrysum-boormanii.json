    "intro": "Helichrysum boormanii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. The flowers are long-lasting when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
