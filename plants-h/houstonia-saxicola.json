    "intro": "Houstonia saxicola, commonly known as the rocky bluemink, is a small perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodlands or along stream banks. The plant produces clusters of delicate blue to violet flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a shallow root system adapted to its harsh habitat. Houstonia saxicola is often found in association with other early-successional plant species in its native range."
