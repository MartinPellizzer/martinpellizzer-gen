    "intro": "Houstonia pubescens, commonly known as the hairy blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, hair-covered stems and small, showy blue to violet flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and the flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Houstonia pubescens is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive appearance."
