    "intro": "Hymenasplenium ngheanense, commonly known as the Nghe An spleenwort, is a rare fern species native to Vietnam. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds. The plant typically grows on moist rock surfaces or in shaded, humid environments. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are located on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
