It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with simple, opposite leaves that are often elliptical in shape. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, and they bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
