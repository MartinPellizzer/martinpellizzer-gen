    "intro": "Hedusa, commonly known as the common hedysarum, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and along roadsides. Hedusa species are perennial herbs that produce pods containing seeds, which are dispersed by wind. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
