    "intro": "Homalium rivulare, commonly known as the river homalium, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange-red berries containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in some horticultural settings."
