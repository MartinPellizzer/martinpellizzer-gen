    "intro": "Hieracium euplecum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed areas. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with a stem that bears yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium euplecum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
