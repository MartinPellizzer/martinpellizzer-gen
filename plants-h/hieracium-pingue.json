    "intro": "Hieracium pingue, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can trap small insects. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense colonies in meadows and along roadsides. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat."
