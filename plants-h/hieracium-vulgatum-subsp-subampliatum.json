    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. subampliatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the stems are erect and covered in fine hairs. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other hawkweed species, contributing to its ecological and botanical significance."
