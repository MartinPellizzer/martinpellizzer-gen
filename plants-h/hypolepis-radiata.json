    "intro": "Hypolepis radiata, commonly known as the golden snake fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often arching fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant features a creeping rhizome with dense clusters of bright yellow sporangia, which give it its common name. Its fronds are pinnately compound, with a smooth, glossy appearance and a tendency to curl at the tips. Hypolepis radiata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, humid environments."
