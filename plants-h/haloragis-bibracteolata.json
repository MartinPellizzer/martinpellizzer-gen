    "intro": "Haloragis bibracteolata, commonly known as the coastal wallaby's foot, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It typically forms dense mats of succulent, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to saline and sandy soils, making it a hardy species found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Its succulent leaves help it store water, allowing it to survive in arid and coastal environments."
