    "intro": "Hedysarum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf needlepod, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters, with slender stems and small, fern-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its seeds are enclosed in narrow, needle-like pods, giving it its common name. Hedysarum minimum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments."
