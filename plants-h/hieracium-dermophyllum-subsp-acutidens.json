    "intro": "Hieracium dermophyllum subsp. acutidens, commonly known as the acute-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lanceolate and sharply pointed, giving it its subspecies name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
