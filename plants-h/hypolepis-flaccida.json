    "intro": "Hypolepis flaccida, commonly known as the wandering spider fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that resemble the shape of a spider's legs, hence its common name. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves, which are typically clustered in groups. Hypolepis flaccida thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
