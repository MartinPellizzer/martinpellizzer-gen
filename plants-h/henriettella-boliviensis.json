    "intro": "Henriettella boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian Henriettella, is a rare flowering plant native to the high Andean regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often bright flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying shades of pink or red, and it blooms during the cooler months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettella boliviensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
