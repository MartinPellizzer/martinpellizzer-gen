    "intro": "Holoschoenus thunbergii, commonly known as the broad-leaved thunberg sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often broad at the base, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense mats. Holoschoenus thunbergii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in wet conditions."
