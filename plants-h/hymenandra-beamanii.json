    "intro": "Hymenandra beamanii, commonly known as the Beaman's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant native to the rainforests of Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched stem and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. The plant produces large, cone-like structures that contain both male and female reproductive organs, typical of cycads. Due to its restricted habitat and threats from deforestation, Hymenandra beamanii is considered endangered and is of significant botanical interest for its evolutionary and ecological importance."
