    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. psammogeton, commonly known as the sand sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy soils in Europe. It features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a loose cluster, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, dry habitats such as dunes and sandy meadows. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
