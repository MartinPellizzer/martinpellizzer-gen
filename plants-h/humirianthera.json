    "intro": "Humirianthera, commonly known as the swamp orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that are typically small to medium in size. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in South America, where they thrive in wet, swampy environments. Humirianthera species usually have pseudobulbs and produce showy inflorescences with a variety of colors. Their botanical significance lies in their unique adaptations to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
