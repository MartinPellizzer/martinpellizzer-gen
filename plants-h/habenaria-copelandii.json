    "intro": "Habenaria copelandii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and fascinating orchid species native to the wet tropical forests of Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom on slender, erect stems. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered in many regions."
