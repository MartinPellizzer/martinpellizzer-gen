    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. chlorotephrinum, commonly known as the green-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
