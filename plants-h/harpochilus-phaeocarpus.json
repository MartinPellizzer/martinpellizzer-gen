    "intro": "Harpochilus phaeocarpus, commonly known as the dark fruit harpochilus, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. Its small, yellow flowers are clustered in inflorescences, and the fruit is a capsule that turns dark when mature. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
