    "intro": "Hieracium thapsiformoides subsp. thapsiformoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with many small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
