It features elongated, narrow leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Helixyra elata is often found in rocky or sandy habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience."
