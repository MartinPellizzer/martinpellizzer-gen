    "intro": "Hieracium texedense, commonly known as the Texas hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in Texas and parts of Mexico. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies and disturbed soils. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a large number of small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. While it is not considered invasive in its native range, it can compete with native vegetation in certain environments."
