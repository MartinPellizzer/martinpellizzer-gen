It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, star-shaped flowers. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. The flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, which is why it is also used in floral arrangements."
