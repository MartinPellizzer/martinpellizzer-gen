It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It has a taproot system and is often found in areas with high humidity. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to cool, damp climates."
