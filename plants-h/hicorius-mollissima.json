    "intro": "Hicorius mollissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a nuisance in certain ecosystems."
