The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Helianthus divaricatus is known for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
