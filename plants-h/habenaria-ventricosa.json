    "intro": "Habenaria ventricosa, commonly known as the bubble orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its unique, inflated pseudobulbs that resemble bubbles, which help store water and nutrients. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellow with intricate patterns, and they bloom during the wet season. Habenaria ventricosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
