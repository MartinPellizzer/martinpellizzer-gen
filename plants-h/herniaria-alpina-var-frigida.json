    "intro": "Herniaria alpina var. frigida, commonly known as the alpine herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to cold, rocky habitats in the Arctic and alpine regions. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clustered flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Its reproductive strategy involves self-fertilization, which helps it persist in isolated environments. The species is also notable for its ability to survive in extreme temperatures and low light conditions."
