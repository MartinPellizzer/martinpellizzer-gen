    "intro": "Herminium elisabethae, commonly known as the Elizabeth's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its flowers are usually clustered in a loose inflorescence and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Herminium elisabethae is considered a threatened species in many areas."
