    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. laceratum, commonly known as the ragged hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features a basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often notched or lobed. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are accompanied by bracts. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive, often ragged appearance due to the irregularly lobed leaves and the presence of glandular dots on the foliage."
