    "intro": "Heracleum acuminatum, commonly known as narrowleaf cowparley, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped clusters called umbels. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
