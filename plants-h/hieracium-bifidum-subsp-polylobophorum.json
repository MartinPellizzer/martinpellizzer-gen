It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. This subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, lobed leaves and is often found in association with other members of the hawkweed genus."
