    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata subsp. baltica, commonly known as Baltic sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth and slender, greenish-blue blades that emit a subtle, sweet fragrance when crushed. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils in meadows, wetlands, and along riverbanks. Its flowering spikes are small and spike-like, producing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife, including insects and small mammals."
