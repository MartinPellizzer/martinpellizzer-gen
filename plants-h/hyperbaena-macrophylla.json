    "intro": "Hyperbaena macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaved hyperbaena, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers full sun to partial shade."
