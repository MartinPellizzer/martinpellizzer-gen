    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hevea brasiliensis monstr. granthanii, commonly known as the Grantham rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces latex used in the rubber industry. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates with high rainfall, typically in tropical regions. It has a straight, slender trunk and can grow up to 30 meters tall. Due to its latex-producing properties, it is of significant economic importance in countries where rubber is a key agricultural product."
