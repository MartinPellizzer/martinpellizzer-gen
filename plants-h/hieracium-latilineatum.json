    "intro": "Hieracium latilineatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium latilineatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
