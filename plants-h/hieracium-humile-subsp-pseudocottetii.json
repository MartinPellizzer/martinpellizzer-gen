    "intro": "Hieracium humile subsp. pseudocottetii, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically features small, yellowish to greenish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
