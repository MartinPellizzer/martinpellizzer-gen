    "intro": "Hieracium lanatum subsp. liottardii, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of white to grayish hairs, giving it a woolly appearance. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in temperate regions with well-drained soils."
