    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculoides f. minima, commonly known as the dwarf water pennywort, is a compact, aquatic plant characterized by its small, rounded leaves that often float on the water surface. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has a short, creeping stem with numerous small leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are usually small and white, appearing in clusters at the base of the leaves. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
