    "intro": "Haworthia aspera, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in white, tuberculate markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are fleshy and store water, allowing the plant to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
