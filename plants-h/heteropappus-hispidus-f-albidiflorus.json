    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus f. albidiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower hawksbeard, is a variant of the hawksbeard plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous perennial with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head, with white ray florets that distinguish this form from other varieties. Its inflorescence is typically borne on long, slender stalks, and the plant produces a distinctive pappus of bristles for seed dispersal. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands."
