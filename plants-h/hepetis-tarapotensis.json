It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Hepetis tarapotensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
