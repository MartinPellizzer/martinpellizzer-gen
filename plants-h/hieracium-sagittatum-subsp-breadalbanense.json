It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and woodland edges. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and is often found in moist or calcareous soils.
