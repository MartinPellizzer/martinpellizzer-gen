    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. integrifolium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed or toothed, with a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
