    "intro": "Helianthemum cirae, commonly known as the rock rose or coastal rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in rocky and coastal environments, often found on sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum cirae is well adapted to coastal climates and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
