    "intro": "Helichrysum leimanthium, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking yellow to orange-colored flower heads, which are composed of numerous small florets. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting flowers make it a valuable addition to both ornamental and ecological gardens."
