    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trichophyllum var. trichophyllum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of short, hairy trichomes. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spore-bearing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous covering. This variety is notable for its intricate morphology and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
