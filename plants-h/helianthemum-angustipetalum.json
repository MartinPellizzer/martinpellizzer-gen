    "intro": "Helianthemum angustipetalum, commonly known as the narrow-petaled rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has compact, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, providing a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in sunny, arid environments. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
