These plants are characterized by their broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. Hymenocoleus species are typically herbaceous and can be found in tropical and subtropical regions. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or greenish in color. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain parts of the world."
