    "intro": "Hannoa longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed hanhoa, is a rare and unique plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, elongated stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hannoa longipes is considered a conservation concern."
