    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum lusus inodorum, commonly known as the odorless hircine orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and a distinctive arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in shaded woodland environments. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, lacking the strong fragrance typical of many orchids. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
