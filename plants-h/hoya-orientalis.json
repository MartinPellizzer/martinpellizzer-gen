    "intro": "Hoya orientalis, commonly known as the Wandering Jew, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in the spring. Hoya orientalis is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Its succulent-like foliage and ornamental flowers make it a favored choice for indoor gardening."
