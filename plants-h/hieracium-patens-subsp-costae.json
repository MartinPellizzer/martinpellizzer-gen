It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive, hairy stems that often bear reddish or purple spots. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a wavy or toothed margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
