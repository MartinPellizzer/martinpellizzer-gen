    "intro": "Hollia africana, commonly known as African hollies, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Hollia africana thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
