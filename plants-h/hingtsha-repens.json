    "intro": "Hingtsha repens, commonly known as the creeping hingtsha, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and alpine terrain. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Hingtsha repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
