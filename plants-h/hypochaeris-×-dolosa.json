    "intro": "Hypochaeris \u00d7 dolosa, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disk shape. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields, preferring full sun and well-drained soil. It has basal leaves that are oblanceolate to elliptic in shape, with hairy surfaces. Hypochaeris \u00d7 dolosa is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
