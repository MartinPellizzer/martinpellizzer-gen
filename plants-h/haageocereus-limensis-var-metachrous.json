    "intro": "Haageocereus limensis var. metachrous, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a cactus species native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and spiny, ribbed structure, which help it conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale pink. These flowers emit a sweet fragrance to attract nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its growth habit and floral characteristics make it a popular choice for succulent gardens and xeriscaping."
