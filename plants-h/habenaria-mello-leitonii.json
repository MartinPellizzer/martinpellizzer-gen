    "intro": "Habenaria mello-leitonii, commonly known as the Mello-Leiton's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its delicate, greenish-white flowers with prominent yellow sepals and petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or branches in the understory of dense forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air and decaying organic matter. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
