    "intro": "Hemiboea longisepala, commonly known as the long-sepaled hemiboea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, tropical environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy texture that helps retain moisture. Hemiboea longisepala is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
