    "intro": "Hakea crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of thick, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, typically in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in spring. Its woody structure and adaptability to arid conditions make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea crassifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native gardens."
