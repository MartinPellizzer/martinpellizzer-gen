    "intro": "Hieracium morisianum subsp. villosiceps, commonly known as the woolly-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are covered in fine, white pubescence. Its inflorescence consists of yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization in its native habitat."
