    "intro": "Habenaria tenuior, commonly known as the slender twayblade, is a small, terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which is essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
