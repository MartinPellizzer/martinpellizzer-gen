It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies furcotae is distinguished by its finely toothed leaves and slightly different floral morphology compared to other subspecies. It thrives in rocky and grassy slopes at high altitudes, often in nutrient-poor soils. This plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments and supports local insect populations."
