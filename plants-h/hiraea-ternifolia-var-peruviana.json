    "intro": "Hiraea ternifolia var. peruviana, commonly known as the Peruvian hiraea, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly Peru, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, branched stems with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in umbrella-like clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal potential, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
