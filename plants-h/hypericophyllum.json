It is characterized by its basal rosette of lobed, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant produces small, oval fruits called cypsela, which are dispersed by wind. Hypericophyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in prairies and open woodlands. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
