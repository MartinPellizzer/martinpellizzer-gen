It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring moist and well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium mallotum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
