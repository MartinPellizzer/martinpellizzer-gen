    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius neograndescens, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands, and can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium neograndescens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
