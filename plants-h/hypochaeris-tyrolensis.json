    "intro": "Hypochaeris tyrolensis, commonly known as the Tyrol sow-thistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and meadows, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive yellowish-green color, and it produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hypochaeris tyrolensis is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
