    "intro": "Hydrotrida, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants characterized by their floating leaves and showy flowers. These plants typically grow in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Their leaves are often broad and buoyant, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers, which can be white, yellow, or pink, open during the day and close at night. Hydrotrida plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
