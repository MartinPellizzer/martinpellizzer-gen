    "intro": "Heliocereus schrankii var. stenopetalus, commonly known as the sun cactus or night-blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its flowers are ephemeral, lasting only a single night before wilting. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and unique nocturnal blooming habit."
