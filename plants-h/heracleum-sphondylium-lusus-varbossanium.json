    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium lusus varbossanium, commonly known as the clustered cow parsley, is a variant of the cow parsley species native to southern Europe. It is a biennial or perennial herb that typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its fruit is a dry, two-lobed achene, and it is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Due to its similarity to other toxic lookalikes, it is important to correctly identify this plant to avoid confusion with more hazardous species."
