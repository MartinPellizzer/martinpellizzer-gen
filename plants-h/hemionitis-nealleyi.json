    "intro": "Hemionitis nealleyi, commonly known as the Nealley's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to the arid regions of southern China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing capsules, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis nealleyi is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
