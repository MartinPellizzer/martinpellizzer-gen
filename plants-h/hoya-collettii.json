    "intro": "Hoya collettii, commonly known as the Wandering Ghost, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. Hoya collettii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
