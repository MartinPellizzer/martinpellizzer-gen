    "intro": "Hornstedtia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin orchid, is a rare and striking species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The flowers are typically pink or purple with distinctive white margins, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited natural habitat and threats from deforestation, it is considered an endangered species."
