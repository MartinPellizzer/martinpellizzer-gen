    "intro": "Hedysarum hedysaroides subsp. hedysaroides, commonly known as the yellow sweetclover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep taproot system, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils and full sun conditions. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its seeds are small and typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across various habitats."
