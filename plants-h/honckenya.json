    "intro": "Honckenya, commonly known as the goldenbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of two species, Honckenya peploides and Honckenya montana, both native to the Mediterranean region. These plants are characterized by their prostrate or ascending growth habit and are often found in rocky or sandy soils. The leaves are typically narrow and covered with a fine, whitish bloom, and the flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Honckenya species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
