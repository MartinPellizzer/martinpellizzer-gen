    "intro": "Hieracium hirsuticeps, commonly known as the hairy-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium hirsuticeps is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
