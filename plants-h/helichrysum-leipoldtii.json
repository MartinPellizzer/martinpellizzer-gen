    "intro": "Helichrysum leipoldtii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its foliage is typically silver or grey-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum leipoldtii is often cultivated as a ornamental plant due to its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
