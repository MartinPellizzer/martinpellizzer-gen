    "intro": "Haplopappus macraeanus, commonly known as the narrowleaf pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, featuring narrow, linear leaves and small yellow flowers. Its adaptations to dry environments include reduced leaf surface area and deep root systems for water conservation. Haplopappus macraeanus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
