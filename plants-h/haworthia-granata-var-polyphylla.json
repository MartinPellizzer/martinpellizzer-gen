    "intro": "Haworthia granata var. polyphylla, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellowish markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
