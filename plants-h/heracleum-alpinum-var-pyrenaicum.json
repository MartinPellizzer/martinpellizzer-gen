    "intro": "Heracleum alpinum var. pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean cow parsley, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high elevations. Its leaves are finely divided and have a mild, parsley-like scent, while its white flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the species."
