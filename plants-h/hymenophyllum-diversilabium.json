    "intro": "Hymenophyllum diversilabium, commonly known as the variable fernlet, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its intricate, moss-like appearance and is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped fronds with a dense covering of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum diversilabium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in humid, shaded environments."
