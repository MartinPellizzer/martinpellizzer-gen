    "intro": "Homalomena peltata, commonly known as the prayer plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, arrow-shaped leaves that fold upwards at night, a behavior known as nyctinasty. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that appear in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its foliage is often variegated with shades of green, red, and silver, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
