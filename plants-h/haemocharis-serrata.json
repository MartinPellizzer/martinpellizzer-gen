    "intro": "Haemocharis serrata, commonly known as the crimson torch lily, is a striking tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in humid, well-drained soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
