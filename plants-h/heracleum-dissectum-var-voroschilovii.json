    "intro": "Heracleum dissectum var. voroschilovii, commonly known as the Voroschilov's cow parsnip, is a variant of the common cow parsnip native to parts of Central Asia. It is a tall biennial plant characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and large, umbrella-shaped flower heads. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fluffy, brown seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in river valleys and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other members of the carrot family, particularly in its leaf structure and floral display."
