    "intro": "Hosta rectifolia f. leucantha, commonly known as the White Form of Straightleaf Hosta, is a cultivar prized for its unique foliage. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are predominantly white with a pale green margin, creating a striking visual contrast. This variety is a foliage plant, meaning its ornamental value lies primarily in its leaves rather than its flowers. It thrives in partial to full shade and requires moist, well-drained soil. The plant is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded landscapes."
