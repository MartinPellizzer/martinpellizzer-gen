    "intro": "Hierochloe tongo var. minor, commonly known as the lesser tongo grass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically forms dense tufts or clumps with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
