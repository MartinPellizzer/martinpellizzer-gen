    "intro": "Hieracium carnosum subsp. eriopodoides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a notable species within the genus Hieracium, which includes many other hawkweed species."
