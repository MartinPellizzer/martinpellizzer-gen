It features rosettes of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellow markings. The leaves are pointed, giving the plant its common name, and are covered in a fine layer of white wax. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
