    "intro": "Hypericum decussatum, commonly known as the cross-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its opposite, oval-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hypericum decussatum is often found in woodland edges, rocky slopes, and disturbed soils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
