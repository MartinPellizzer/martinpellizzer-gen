    "intro": "Haworthiopsis koelmaniorum var. koelmaniorum, commonly known as the Koelman's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically a mix of green, blue-gray, and white hues, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the spring or early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its slow growth and drought tolerance. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
