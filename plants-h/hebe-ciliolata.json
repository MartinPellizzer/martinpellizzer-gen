    "intro": "Hebe ciliolata, commonly known as the flax-leaved hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. Hebe ciliolata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
