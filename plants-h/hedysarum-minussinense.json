    "intro": "Hedysarum minussinense, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects. Hedysarum minussinense is also valued for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
