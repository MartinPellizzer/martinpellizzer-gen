    "intro": "Huperzia macrostachys, commonly known as the giant clubmoss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems and dense clusters of small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its branches, which are typically reddish in color. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and ecological role, it is often found in forest understories and is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
