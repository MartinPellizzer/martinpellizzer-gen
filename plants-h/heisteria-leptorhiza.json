    "intro": "Heisteria leptorhiza, commonly known as the slenderleaf heister, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It features erect, branching stems covered in small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually pale yellow to greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
