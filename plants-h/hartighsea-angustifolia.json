It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters wide. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Hartighsea angustifolia is often found in coastal and woodland habitats, where it plays a role in local biodiversity."
