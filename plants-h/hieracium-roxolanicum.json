It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from white to pink. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
