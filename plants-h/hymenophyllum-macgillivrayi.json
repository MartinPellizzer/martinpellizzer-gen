    "intro": "Hymenophyllum macgillivrayi, commonly known as the MacGillivray's filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species is notable for its intricate morphology and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
