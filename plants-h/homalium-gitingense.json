    "intro": "Homalium gitingense, commonly known as the Gitingense Balsa, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellowish-green inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters in its natural habitat. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Homalium gitingense is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
