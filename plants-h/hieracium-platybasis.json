It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish to reddish composite flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
