    "intro": "Habenaria polyantha, commonly known as the pink lady's slipper, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive pink or purple flowers that resemble a slipper, with a pouch-like structure at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and swamps. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps retain moisture. Habenaria polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
