    "intro": "Halothamnus cinerascens var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth halothamnus, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) stems and leaves, which are adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas where salt spray is common. Its small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the spring and early summer. This variety is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
