    "intro": "Hyperacanthus ambovombensis, commonly known as the Madagascar spurge, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded habitats within the rainforests of the island. Its latex is milky and contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
