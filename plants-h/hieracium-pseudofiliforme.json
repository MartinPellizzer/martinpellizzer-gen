    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofiliforme, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium pseudofiliforme is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative growth and seeds, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
