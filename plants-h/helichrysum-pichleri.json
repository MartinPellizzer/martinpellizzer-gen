    "intro": "Helichrysum pichleri, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, sunny environments. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow or golden-orange inflorescences, which give it a striking appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Helichrysum pichleri is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant color."
