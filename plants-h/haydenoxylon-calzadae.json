    "intro": "Haydenoxylon calzadae, commonly known as the Calzada's ghostwood, is a rare and ancient plant species characterized by its unique preservation in fossilized form. It is primarily known from its well-preserved wood found in Miocene-aged deposits in Colombia. The plant is notable for its intricate cellular structure, which provides valuable insights into the morphology of early angiosperms. Its discovery has contributed significantly to the understanding of Paleogene flora and evolutionary plant anatomy. The name honors Dr. Luis Calzada, a paleobotanist who made key contributions to its identification and study."
