    "intro": "Haloragis prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate waterwheel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Africa. It thrives in wet, marshy environments and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers. The plant has a creeping stem that often forms dense mats, which helps it colonize waterlogged soils effectively. It is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding and has a fibrous root system that stabilizes the soil. Haloragis prostrata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
