    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoauricula, commonly known as the false goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough textures, and its flowers range from yellow to brown, depending on the stage of bloom. Hieracium pseudoauricula is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
