    "intro": "Hieracium auricula var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Due to its hairy stems and smooth leaves, it is distinguishable from other hawkweed species."
