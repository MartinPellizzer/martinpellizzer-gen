It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which is typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Hieracium hypolizon is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
