    "intro": "Haloragis suffruticosa var. galioides, commonly known as the coastal saltbush, is a low-growing shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. The plant produces tiny, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt-laden coastal environments. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to stabilize dunes and prevent erosion."
