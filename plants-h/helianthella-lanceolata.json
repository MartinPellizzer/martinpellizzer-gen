    "intro": "Helianthella lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf helianthella, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It has a compact growth habit with a fibrous root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. Helianthella lanceolata is often found in open grasslands and is a component of native plant communities in its range."
