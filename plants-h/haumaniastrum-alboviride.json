    "intro": "Haumaniastrum alboviride, commonly known as the white-green leaf cactus, is a member of the Cactaceae family. It is native to the arid regions of North America, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in pale green to white spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. The plant is adapted to survive in extreme drought conditions, storing water in its succulent stems."
