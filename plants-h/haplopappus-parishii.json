    "intro": "Haplopappus parishii, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in sandy or gravelly soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces fluffy, white pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Haplopappus parishii is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
