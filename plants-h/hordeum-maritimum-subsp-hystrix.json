    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum subsp. hystrix, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and maritime environments. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in tough, straw-like glumes, which help protect them from harsh coastal conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various wildlife."
