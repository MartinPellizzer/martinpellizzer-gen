    "intro": "Huperzia ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate fern, is a species of tropical fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, ovate-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to regions in Southeast Asia, including countries like India, China, and Indonesia. Huperzia ovatifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
