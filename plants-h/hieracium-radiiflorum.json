    "intro": "Hieracium radiiflorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces a milky sap when damaged. Hieracium radiiflorum is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
