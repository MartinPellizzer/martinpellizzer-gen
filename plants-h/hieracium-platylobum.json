    "intro": "Hieracium platylobum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, flattened shape. Hieracium platylobum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
