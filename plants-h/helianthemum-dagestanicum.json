    "intro": "Helianthemum dagestanicum, commonly known as the Dagestani rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Caucasus region. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, rocky habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean and temperate climates."
