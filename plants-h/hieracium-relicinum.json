    "intro": "Hieracium relicinum, commonly known as the lesser spear thistle, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are usually spiny and arranged in a rosette, while the flowers are yellow and borne on long, slender stems. It is considered a weed in some regions but also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
