    "intro": "Hakea pilulifera, commonly known as the Christmas hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in late summer, typically around Christmas, hence its common name. The plant has needle-like leaves that are usually covered in a fine, white bloom, giving it a silvery appearance. Its flowers are usually pink or red and are arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. Hakea pilulifera is well adapted to arid conditions and is often found in coastal and sandy soils."
