    "intro": "Hieracium racemosum subsp. alismatifolium, commonly known as the waterleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces a single, tall flowering stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are often mistaken for those of waterleaf (Lithospermum officinale) due to their similar appearance. This subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and wetlands."
