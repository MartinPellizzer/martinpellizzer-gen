    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to alpine and subalpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of short, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
