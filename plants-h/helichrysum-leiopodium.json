    "intro": "Helichrysum leiopodium, commonly known as the silky helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, fluffy appearance, with small, yellowish or golden flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant has hairy, silver-green leaves that give it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum leiopodium is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
