    "intro": "Hymenasplenium kinabaluense, commonly known as the Kinabalu spleenwort, is a rare and endemic fern found in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds with a unique morphology. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in shaded crevices. Its reproductive structures are specialized, with spores produced in capsules that are protected by leaf-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species within its ecosystem."
