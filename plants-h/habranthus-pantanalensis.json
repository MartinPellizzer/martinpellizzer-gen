    "intro": "Habranthus pantanalensis, commonly known as the Pantanal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the Pantanal wetlands of South America. It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom during the rainy season. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats and has a low, sprawling growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are sturdy and fibrous. This species plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland areas."
