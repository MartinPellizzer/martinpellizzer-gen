    "intro": "Haplopappus eximius subsp. typicus, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by bristly, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This species plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
