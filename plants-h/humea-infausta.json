    "intro": "Humea infausta, commonly known as the devil's orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, often dark-colored flowers and unique, elongated petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, thriving in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Its botanical features include a slender stem and lanceolate leaves with a waxy texture. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Humea infausta is considered a conservation concern."
