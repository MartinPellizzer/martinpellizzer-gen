    "intro": "Hieracium friesianum, commonly known as the Friesian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, particularly the Netherlands. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it has hairy stems and basal leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare species in many regions."
