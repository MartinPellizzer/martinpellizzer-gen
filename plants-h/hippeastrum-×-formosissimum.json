    "intro": "Hippeastrum \u00d7 formosissimum, commonly known as the Amazonian belladonna lily, is a hybrid plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter, often in shades of red, orange, or yellow. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped blooms that are typically borne on tall, leafless stems. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
