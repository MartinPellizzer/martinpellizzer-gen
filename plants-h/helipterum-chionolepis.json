    "intro": "Helipterum chionolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with a compact, mat-forming growth habit, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, white seed heads. Its leaves are silvery-gray, covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helipterum chionolepis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
