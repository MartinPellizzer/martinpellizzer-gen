    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. tenuissimum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disk-like structure. The species is characterized by its slender stem and reduced leaf size, distinguishing it from other hawkweed species."
