    "intro": "Helmiopsis richardii, commonly known as the Richard's helmiopsis, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, finely divided leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. The plant produces tiny, white to pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, a feature common in the carrot family. It is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Helmiopsis richardii is considered a vulnerable species."
