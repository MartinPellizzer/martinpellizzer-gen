    "intro": "Hippocrepis scabra var. jayana, commonly known as the Jayana helleborine, is a variant of the common helleborine, characterized by its distinctive, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with three petals, which are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for certain Lepidoptera species and its use in traditional herbal medicine. The varietal form, jayana, is distinguished by specific morphological traits that set it apart from the typical variety of Hippocrepis scabra."
