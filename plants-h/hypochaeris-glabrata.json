    "intro": "Hypochaeris glabrata, commonly known as the smooth sow-thistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of smooth, fleshy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
