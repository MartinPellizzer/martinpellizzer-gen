    "intro": "Hierochloe spicata, commonly known as spikeless bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are typically arranged in a loose panicle, giving it its scientific name. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained, nutrient-poor environments, making it a common component of alpine and coastal vegetation. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration projects."
