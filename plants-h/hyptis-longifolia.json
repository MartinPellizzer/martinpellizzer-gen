It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes many aromatic plants such as mint and basil. The plant is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, tubular flowers are typically purple or violet, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds. Hyptis longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
