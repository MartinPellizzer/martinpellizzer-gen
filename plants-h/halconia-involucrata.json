    "intro": "Halconia involucrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf orchid, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, velvety green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense colonies. Halconia involucrata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates."
