    "intro": "Hologymne douglasii, commonly known as Douglas's holocarp, is a rare and unique plant species native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its distinctive holocarpic reproductive structure, where the fruit develops from the fusion of multiple carpels. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a leathery texture with a dark green upper surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hologymne douglasii is considered a conservation concern."
