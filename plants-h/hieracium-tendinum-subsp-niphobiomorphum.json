It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. It is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate low light conditions. Its subspecific name, *niphobiomorphum*, reflects its association with snow-covered environments."
