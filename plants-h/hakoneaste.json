    "intro": "Hakoneaste, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen fern, is a member of the Dryopteris genus. It is characterized by its lush, dark green fronds that are often adorned with intricate, lace-like patterns. Native to Japan, this plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread gradually, forming dense clumps over time. Hakoneaste is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
