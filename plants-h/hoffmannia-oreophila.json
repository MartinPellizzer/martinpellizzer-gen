    "intro": "Hoffmannia oreophila, commonly known as the mountain hoffmannia, is a rare and specialized plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the warmer months. Hoffmannia oreophila thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or mountainous terrain. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
