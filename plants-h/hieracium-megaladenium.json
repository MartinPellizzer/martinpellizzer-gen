    "intro": "Hieracium megaladenium, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant features a robust stem that can grow up to 1 meter in height, with serrated, lance-shaped leaves. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late summer, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic weed in many regions."
