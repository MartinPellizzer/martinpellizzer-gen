    "intro": "Helianthemum helianthemoides, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry, rocky environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry grasslands. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
