    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum f. mixtum, commonly known as the rock rose or evergreen rock rose, is a hybrid form of the evergreen rock rose, native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with compact, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, white, and red, which bloom in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
