    "intro": "Hevea rigidifolia, commonly known as the hard-leaved rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to high humidity and warm temperatures. Due to its ecological importance and potential for rubber production, it is a subject of interest in botanical research."
