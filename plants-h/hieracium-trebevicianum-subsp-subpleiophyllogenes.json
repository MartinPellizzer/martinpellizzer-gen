    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. subpleiophyllogenes, commonly known as the Balkan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southeastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces numerous small seeds dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is distinguished by its pleiophylloides-like leaf morphology, which sets it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus."
