    "intro": "Hippocratea rubiginosa, commonly known as the red-staining hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Central and South America. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, and it is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its name derives from the reddish discoloration that appears on its stems and leaves when damaged, a trait that aids in its identification."
