    "intro": "Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum, commonly known as the blood-veined fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, often reddish or brownish fronds that give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually less than 10 centimeters long and have a unique, intricate venation pattern. Hymenophyllum sanguinolentum is often epiphytic, growing on tree trunks or rocks in humid climates."
