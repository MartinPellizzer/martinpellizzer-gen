    "intro": "Hackelia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flower bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, branched stems that rise from a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed and have a distinctive, spurred structure at the base. Hackelia parviflora is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
