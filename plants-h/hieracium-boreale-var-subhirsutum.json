    "intro": "Hieracium boreale var. subhirsutum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow to orange flower heads. The leaves are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette, while the stems are usually covered with fine, soft hairs. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges, and is often found in moist to dry soils. This variant is distinguished by its slightly hairy foliage and smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Hieracium species."
