    "intro": "Hieracium supplicatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Hieracium supplicatum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
