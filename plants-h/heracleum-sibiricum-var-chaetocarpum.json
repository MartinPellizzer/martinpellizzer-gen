    "intro": "Heracleum sibiricum var. chaetocarpum, commonly known as Siberian cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-shaped inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. The plant is native to temperate regions of Asia and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It has a taproot system and can grow up to 2 meters in height. Due to its similar appearance to other toxic lookalikes, it is important to correctly identify this plant to avoid confusion with more dangerous species."
