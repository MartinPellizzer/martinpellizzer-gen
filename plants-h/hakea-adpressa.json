    "intro": "Hakea adpressa, commonly known as the prostrate hakea, is a low-growing shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hakea adpressa is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal."
