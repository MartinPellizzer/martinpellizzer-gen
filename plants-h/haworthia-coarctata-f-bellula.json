It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically tinged with red or pink at the tips, especially when exposed to bright light. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect sunlight. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
