It is characterized by its striking, often bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow in the dark. These plants are native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The leaves are typically broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Hieronymusia species are primarily grown as ornamental plants due to their unique and mesmerizing appearance."
