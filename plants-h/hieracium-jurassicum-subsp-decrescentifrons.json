    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. decrescentifrons, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its decurrently hairy leaves and a unique floral structure that sets it apart from other hawkweed species. It is typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
