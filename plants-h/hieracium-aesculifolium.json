    "intro": "Hieracium aesculifolium, commonly known as the horse chestnut hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are deeply lobed and resemble those of the horse chestnut tree, giving it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
