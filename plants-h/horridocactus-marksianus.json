It is characterized by its spiny, cylindrical stems that are often covered in white, woolly hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the tips of the stems. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping and cactus enthusiasts."
