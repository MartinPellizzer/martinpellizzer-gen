    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. boreanum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in cooler climates. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it well adapted to the harsh conditions of its native environment."
