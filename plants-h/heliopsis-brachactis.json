    "intro": "Heliopsis brachactis, commonly known as the narrowleaf heliopsis, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its narrow, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Heliopsis brachactis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
