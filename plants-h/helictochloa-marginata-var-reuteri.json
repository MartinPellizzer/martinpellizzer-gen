    "intro": "Helictochloa marginata var. reuteri, commonly known as the coastal panicgrass, is a grass species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves with a distinctive silver-gray margin. The plant produces small, pale green to brown spikelets that are clustered along the stems. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often found in dune environments and is valued for its resilience and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
