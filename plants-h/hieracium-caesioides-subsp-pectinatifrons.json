It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The leaves are typically hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are erect and somewhat branched.

It thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in moist or semi-shaded environments."
