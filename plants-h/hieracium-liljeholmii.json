    "intro": "Hieracium liljeholmii, commonly known as the Liljeholm's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandy or gravelly soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
