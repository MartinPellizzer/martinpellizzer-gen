It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the spring and summer seasons. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss."
