    "intro": "Heldreichia bupleurifolia, commonly known as the Balkan bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
