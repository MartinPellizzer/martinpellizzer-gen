    "intro": "Hieracium xerophilum, commonly known as the desert hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Hieracium xerophilum is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
