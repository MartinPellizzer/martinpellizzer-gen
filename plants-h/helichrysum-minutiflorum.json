    "intro": "Helichrysum minutiflorum, commonly known as the Cape snowflake, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, white to pale yellow flowers that resemble snowflakes, which bloom in clusters. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color when dried."
