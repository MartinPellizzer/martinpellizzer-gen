    "intro": "Hieracium viscidulum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant is known for its sticky, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Hieracium viscidulum is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
