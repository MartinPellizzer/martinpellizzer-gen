    "intro": "Hydrostachys longifida, commonly known as the slender-stemmed watergrass, is a perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, linear leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are usually green or pale yellow, followed by small, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it often forms dense mats. Hydrostachys longifida is adapted to waterlogged soils and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
