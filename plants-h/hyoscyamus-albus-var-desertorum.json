    "intro": "Hyoscyamus albus var. desertorum, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its spiny stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are encased in a hard, ribbed capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds effectively. Due to its toxic properties, it is often considered a noxious weed in agricultural areas."
