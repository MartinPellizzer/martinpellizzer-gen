    "intro": "Hemibaccharis androgyna, commonly known as the Brazilian cherry or *H. androgyna*, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or white, and its elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, red, fleshy fruits that are edible and often consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
