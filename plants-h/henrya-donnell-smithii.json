    "intro": "Henrya donnell-smithii, commonly known as the Donnell-Smith's henrya, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of California. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of narrow, evergreen leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henrya donnell-smithii is considered endangered and is protected under various conservation efforts."
