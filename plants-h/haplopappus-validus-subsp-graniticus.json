    "intro": "Haplopappus validus subsp. graniticus, commonly known as the granitic haper, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in western North America. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green foliage adapted to withstand harsh, dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees and flies. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. This subspecies is often found on granitic outcrops and is well-suited to the extreme conditions of its native habitat."
