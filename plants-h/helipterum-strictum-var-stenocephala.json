    "intro": "Helipterum strictum var. stenocephala, commonly known as narrow-headed helipterum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often found in arid or semi-arid regions. The plant features slender, erect stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
