    "intro": "Hieracium psychroadenium, commonly known as the \"mad-hatter's weed,\" is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is a perennial herb that thrives in temperate climates and is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit. The common name reflects its historical association with the mad hatter, a term derived from the mercury poisoning suffered by hat makers."
