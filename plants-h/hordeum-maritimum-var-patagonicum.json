    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum var. patagonicum, commonly known as Patagonian wild barley, is a perennial grass species native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves, and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including strong winds and salt spray. This variety is of interest in ecological studies due to its resilience and potential for use in coastal restoration projects."
