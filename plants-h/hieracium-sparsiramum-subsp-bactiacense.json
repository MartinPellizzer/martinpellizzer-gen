    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiramum subsp. bactiacense, commonly known as the Bactrian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
