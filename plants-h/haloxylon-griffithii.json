    "intro": "Haloxylon griffithii, commonly known as the Indian date palm, is a shrub or small tree native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are often clustered in panicles, followed by edible, date-like fruits. Haloxylon griffithii is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, making it an important species for stabilizing sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and traditional uses in local communities."
