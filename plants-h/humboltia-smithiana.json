    "intro": "Humboltia smithiana, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, thriving in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, providing year-round structure to the landscape. Humboltia smithiana plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds that feed on its berries."
