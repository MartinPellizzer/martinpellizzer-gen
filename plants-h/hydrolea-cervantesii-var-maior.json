    "intro": "Hydrolea cervantesii var. maior, commonly known as the greater hydrolea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, well-drained environments. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
