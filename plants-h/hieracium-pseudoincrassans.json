    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoincrassans, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
