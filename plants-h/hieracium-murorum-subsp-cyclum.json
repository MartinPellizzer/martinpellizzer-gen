It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
