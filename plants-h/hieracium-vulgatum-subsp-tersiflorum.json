    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. tersiflorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The flowers are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
