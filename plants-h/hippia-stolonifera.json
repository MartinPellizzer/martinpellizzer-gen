    "intro": "Hippia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping thyme, is a low-growing perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically in late spring. The plant has woody stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread via stolons, forming dense mats. Its leaves are narrow and aromatic, often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover."
