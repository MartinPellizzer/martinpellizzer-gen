    "intro": "Hippeastrum longitubum, commonly known as the long-tube amaryllis, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 12 inches in diameter, typically in shades of red, orange, and white. The plant produces a tall, slender stem with several leaves that are broad and strap-like. Its flowers are unique for their elongated, tubular shape, which is adapted for pollination by specific insect species. Hippeastrum longitubum is a popular ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
