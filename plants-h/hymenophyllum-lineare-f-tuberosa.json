    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lineare f. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous shield fern, is a rare and delicate fern species belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, overlapping, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocky surfaces or in moist, shaded forest floors. Its unique feature is the presence of tuberous structures beneath the soil, which help it store moisture and nutrients. This fern is of interest to botanists due to its specialized morphology and limited distribution."
