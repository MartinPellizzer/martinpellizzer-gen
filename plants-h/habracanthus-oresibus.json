It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes many milkweed species known for their toxic sap. The plant features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, attracting pollinators like butterflies and bees. Its leaves are opposite and oval, often with a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains cardiac glycosides, making it potentially toxic to livestock and humans if ingested."
