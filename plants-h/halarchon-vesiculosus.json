    "intro": "Halarchon vesiculosus, commonly known as the bladder snail, is a freshwater gastropod belonging to the family Lymnaeidae. It is characterized by its soft, muscular body and a distinct, spiral-shaped shell that is often smooth and pale in color. The plant-like appearance of its shell has led to its common name, though it is not a true plant but a mollusk. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Halarchon vesiculosus plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by feeding on algae and detritus, contributing to nutrient cycling."
