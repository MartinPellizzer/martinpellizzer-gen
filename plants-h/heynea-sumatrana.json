    "intro": "Heynea sumatrana, commonly known as the Sumatran ironwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, hard, and heavy wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The tree has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by small, round fruits containing a single seed. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
