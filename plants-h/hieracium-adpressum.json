    "intro": "Hieracium adpressum, commonly known as the pressed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are covered with dense, glandular hairs. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind."
