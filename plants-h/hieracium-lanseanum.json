    "intro": "Hieracium lanseanum, commonly known as the lance-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by seed heads that disperse easily. Hieracium lanseanum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can be invasive in certain regions."
