    "intro": "Homalium pronyense, commonly known as the Prony's glorywood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the rainforests of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often glossy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by elongated, fleshy fruits. Its ornamental value is due to its attractive foliage and showy blooms, making it a sought-after species in horticulture. However, it is relatively rare in cultivation and requires specific conditions to thrive."
