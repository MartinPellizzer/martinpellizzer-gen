    "intro": "Helichrysum pseudolitoreum, commonly known as the coastal everlasting or sand everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellowish to orange-colored flowers that are often mistaken for daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, silvery hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum pseudolitoreum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden settings where it can withstand harsh, sunny conditions."
