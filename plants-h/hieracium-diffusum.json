    "intro": "Hieracium diffusum, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soil. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium diffusum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
