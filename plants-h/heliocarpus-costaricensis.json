    "intro": "Heliocarpus costaricensis, commonly known as the golden balsa, is a tropical tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by distinctive, woody, spirally arranged fruits. Its seeds are encased in a hard, helmet-shaped structure that aids in seed dispersal. Heliocarpus costaricensis is often found in moist, lowland forests and is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
