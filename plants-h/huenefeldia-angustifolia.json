    "intro": "Huenefeldia angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved huenefeldia, is a member of the Araliaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that contain the seeds. Native to South America, particularly Brazil, it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
