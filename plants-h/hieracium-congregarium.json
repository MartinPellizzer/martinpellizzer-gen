    "intro": "Hieracium congregarium, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
