    "intro": "Haemanthus undulatus, commonly known as the painted tongue or painted spear, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of glossy, dark green leaves with distinctive red veins, which become more pronounced as the plant matures. The plant produces clusters of bright orange-red, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
