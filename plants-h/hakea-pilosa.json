    "intro": "Hakea pilosa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical spikes. Hakea pilosa is adapted to coastal environments, thriving in sandy soils and salty air. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
