    "intro": "Hepatica maxima, commonly known as the giant liverwort, is a type of liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It belongs to the family Marchantiaceae and is characterized by its simple, lobed leaves that resemble the shape of a liver. The plant typically grows close to the ground, forming dense mats that help retain soil moisture. Hepatica maxima is often found in temperate regions with high humidity and moderate temperatures. It plays an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
