It has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or yellow and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Humata attenuata is native to parts of South America and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions."
