    "intro": "Helianthemum caput-felis, commonly known as the cat's paw sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its common name refers to the shape of its leaves, which resemble a cat's paw."
