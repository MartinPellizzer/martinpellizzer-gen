    "intro": "Hieracium lanseanum subsp. lanseanum, commonly known as the lance-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, with ray florets that are usually sterile, giving it a daisy-like appearance. The species is characterized by its robust growth and is often found in disturbed habitats."
