    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. stenobracteum, commonly known as the narrow-bracted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow flowers in dense clusters. Its subspecies distinction is primarily based on morphological differences, particularly in the structure of its bracts. It is often found in temperate climates and is part of the Asteraceae family."
