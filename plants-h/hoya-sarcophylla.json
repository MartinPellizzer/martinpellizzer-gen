    "intro": "Hoya sarcophylla, commonly known as the \"Coffin Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting pollinators like moths and bees. Hoya sarcophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
