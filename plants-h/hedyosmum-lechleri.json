    "intro": "Hedyosmum lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian rubber tree, is a species native to the Peruvian Amazon. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and produces a milky latex sap that has been traditionally used for rubber production. The plant thrives in tropical rainforest environments, requiring high humidity and warm temperatures. Its bark and latex contain bioactive compounds that have been studied for their medicinal properties. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
