It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer.
