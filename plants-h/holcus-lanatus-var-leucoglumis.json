    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. leucoglumis, commonly known as the white-haired bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species characterized by its pale, almost white inflorescence. It is a low-growing, perennial grass native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant has slender, ascending stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typically pale green to white in color. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
