    "intro": "Heterostalis pedata, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It has small, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils. Heterostalis pedata is often found in coastal dunes and gravelly habitats, where it plays a role in preventing erosion."
