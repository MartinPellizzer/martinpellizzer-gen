    "intro": "Hedysarum alpinum subsp. laxiflorum, commonly known as the Alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Hedysarum alpinum subsp. laxiflorum plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native environment."
