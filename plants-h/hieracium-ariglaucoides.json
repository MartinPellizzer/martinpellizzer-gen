    "intro": "Hieracium ariglaucoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are bright yellow with a central disk. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
