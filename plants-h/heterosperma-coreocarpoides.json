    "intro": "Heterosperma coreocarpoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a characteristic known as dioecy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy in aquatic environments."
