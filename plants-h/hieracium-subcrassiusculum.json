It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
