    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. oelandicum, commonly known as the Oeland sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Scandinavia. It typically features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it survive in its arid, sandy habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
