    "intro": "Herniaria fruticosa var. longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf herniaria, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, succulent leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or rocky habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
