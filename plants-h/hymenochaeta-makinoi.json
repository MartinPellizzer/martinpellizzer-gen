    "intro": "Hymenochaeta makinoi, commonly known as the Japanese bracket fungus, is a basidiomycete mushroom that belongs to the family Hymenogastraceae. It is characterized by its bracket-shaped fruiting bodies that typically grow on decaying wood, particularly in humid forest environments. The cap is usually light brown to reddish-brown, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface, while the stem is shorter and often covered in fine, silky hairs. This species is primarily found in Asia, including Japan, China, and parts of Southeast Asia. Its ecological role involves decomposing dead wood, contributing to nutrient cycling in forest ecosystems."
