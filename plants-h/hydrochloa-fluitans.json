    "intro": "Hydrochloa fluitans, commonly known as the floating bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant native to freshwater environments. It is characterized by its tiny, floating leaves that are often covered in specialized structures called bladders, which help it absorb nutrients from the water. The plant is a member of the Lentibulariaceae family and is known for its ability to trap and digest small aquatic organisms. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters and is often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in nutrient-poor environments by supplementing its diet with captured prey."
