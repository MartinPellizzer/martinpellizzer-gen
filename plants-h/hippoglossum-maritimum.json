    "intro": "Hippoglossum maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hippoglossum maritimum is often found in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
