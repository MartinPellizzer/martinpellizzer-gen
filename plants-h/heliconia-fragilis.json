    "intro": "Heliconia fragilis, commonly known as the fragrant heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often surrounded by a rosy or pinkish spathe. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in wet, swampy environments. Heliconia fragilis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
