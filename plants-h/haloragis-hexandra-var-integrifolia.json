    "intro": "Haloragis hexandra var. integrifolia, commonly known as the coastal wallaby's ear, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces small, white to pale blue flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to saline and wind-exposed environments. This species is often found growing in coastal dunes and rocky shorelines, contributing to the ecological stability of these habitats."
