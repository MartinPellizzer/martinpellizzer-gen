    "intro": "Heteropterys crenulata f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its palmate leaves with lobed margins. The plant typically has smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical form. Its flowers are small and clustered, often in terminal panicles, and it produces berries that are edible. This form is notable for its reduced glandular structures, which may contribute to its unique ecological adaptations."
