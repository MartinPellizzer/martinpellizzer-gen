    "intro": "Hasselquistia pinnata, commonly known as the slender swamp willow, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It is characterized by its delicate, willow-like appearance with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, typical of the Salicaceae family. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Hasselquistia pinnata plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
