It features large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in garden settings."
