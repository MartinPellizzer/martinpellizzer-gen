    "intro": "Hydrobryum kaengsophense, commonly known as the Thai marsh fern, is a rare aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds. The plant has a complex rhizome system that helps it anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Its spores are dispersed by water currents, aiding in its propagation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
