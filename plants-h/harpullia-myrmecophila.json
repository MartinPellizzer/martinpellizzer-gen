    "intro": "Harpullia myrmecophila, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark and its ability to thrive in saline and waterlogged soils. The plant has a unique root system that includes pneumatophores, which help it breathe in oxygen-poor swamp environments. Its small, clustered flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. This species plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and stabilizing shorelines."
