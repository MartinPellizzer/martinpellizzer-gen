It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces bright yellow to orange flowers that are tightly clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs. Helichrysum micranthum is well adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
