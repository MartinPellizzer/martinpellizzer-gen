    "intro": "Hibiscus colleri, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to red, with a distinctive velvety texture on the petals. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft appearance. Hibiscus colleri thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its traditional uses in some cultures."
