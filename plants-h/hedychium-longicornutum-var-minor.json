    "intro": "Hedychium longicornutum var. minor, commonly known as the lesser golden ginger, is a tropical plant belonging to the Zingiberaceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, sword-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, yellow-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its rhizomes are used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
