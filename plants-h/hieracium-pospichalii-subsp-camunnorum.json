    "intro": "Hieracium pospichalii subsp. camunnorum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
