    "intro": "Heteropterys laevifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leafed heteropterys, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, alternate, and often elliptical leaves that are smooth and glossy on both sides. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by small, round fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
