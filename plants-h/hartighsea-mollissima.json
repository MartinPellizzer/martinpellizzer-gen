    "intro": "Hartighsea mollissima, commonly known as the soft moss, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the division Bryophyta. It is characterized by its delicate, cushion-like growth form and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant's leaves are thin, elongated, and often covered in a fine layer of silica, which contributes to its soft texture. Hartighsea mollissima plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its habitat. It reproduces through spores released from small, capsule-like structures called sporangia."
