    "intro": "Hoarea gracilis, commonly known as the slender horsetail, is a perennial plant belonging to the Equisetaceae family. It is characterized by its jointed, hollow stems that are covered in small, scale-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like appendages, and it produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems. Hoarea gracilis is known for its ancient lineage, dating back to the Carboniferous period."
