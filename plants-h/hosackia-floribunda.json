    "intro": "Hosackia floribunda, commonly known as the showy milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces showy, bright yellow to orange flowers in late spring. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Hosackia floribunda is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a food source for pollinators."
