    "intro": "Heracleum millefolium, commonly known as cow parsley, is a flowering plant in the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white or greenish-yellow flowers that appear in umbrella-like clusters. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia and thrives in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its attractive appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
