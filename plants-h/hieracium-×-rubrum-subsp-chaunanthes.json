It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in areas with diverse soil types."
