    "intro": "Hieracium laurinum subsp. lactescens, commonly known as the milky buttercup, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with a distinctive milky sap that exudes from the stems and leaves when damaged. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows and woodland edges. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowers are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
