It features small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine, hairy texture, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its growth habit is typically upright, with a dense, rounded form that makes it suitable for small gardens or containers. The foliage remains green throughout the growing season, adding visual interest even when the flowers have faded."
