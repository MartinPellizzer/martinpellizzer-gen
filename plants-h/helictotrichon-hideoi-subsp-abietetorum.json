    "intro": "Helictotrichon hideoi subsp. abietetorum, commonly known as the Bitterroot needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to arid environments and contribute to its ecological significance in native plant communities."
