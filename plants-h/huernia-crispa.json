    "intro": "Huernia crispa, commonly known as the horned lithops, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically during the summer months. Its unique appearance, resembling miniature horns or stones, helps it blend into its arid environment. Huernia crispa is well adapted to hot, dry conditions and requires minimal water to thrive."
