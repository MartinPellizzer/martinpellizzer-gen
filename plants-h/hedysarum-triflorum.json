    "intro": "Hedysarum triflorum, commonly known as the three-flowered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum triflorum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural environment."
