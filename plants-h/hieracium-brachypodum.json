    "intro": "Hieracium brachypodum, commonly known as the shortfoot hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium brachypodum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
