    "intro": "Hieracium evolutum, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium evolutum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
