    "intro": "Hippion involucratum, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by a modified leaf structure called an involucrum. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many other spurge species known for their latex-producing properties. Hippion involucratum is often found in rocky soils and can be used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
