    "intro": "Habenaria borneensis, commonly known as the Bornean Habenaria, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to the tropical regions of Borneo. This terrestrial orchid typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. Its flowers are small and usually white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by insects. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in its humid, low-light environment. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes collected for horticultural purposes."
