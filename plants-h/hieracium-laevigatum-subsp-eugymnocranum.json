    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. eugymnocranum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered with fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear a dense cluster of yellowish to reddish-orange flowers. Its inflorescence is a composite head composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, as well as its specific geographic distribution."
