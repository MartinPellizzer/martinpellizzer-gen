    "intro": "Helianthemum minutum, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, needle-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helianthemum minutum is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
