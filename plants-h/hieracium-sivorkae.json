It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium sivorkae is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
