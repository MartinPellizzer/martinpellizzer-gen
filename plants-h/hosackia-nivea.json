    "intro": "Hosackia nivea, commonly known as the white prairie clover, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open prairies and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hosackia nivea plays an important ecological role by fixing nitrogen in the soil, benefiting surrounding vegetation."
