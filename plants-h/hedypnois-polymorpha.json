    "intro": "Hedypnois polymorpha, commonly known as the common green alga, is a freshwater green algae species belonging to the family Chlorococcales. It is characterized by its simple, unicellular structure with a spherical or ellipsoidal shape. The plant typically forms dense colonies in still or slow-moving water, often in nutrient-rich environments. Hedypnois polymorpha reproduces asexually through cell division, allowing for rapid population growth under favorable conditions. It plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by serving as a food source for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
