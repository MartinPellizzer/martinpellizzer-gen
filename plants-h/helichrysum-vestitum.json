    "intro": "Helichrysum vestitum, commonly known as the golden everlasting or velvet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and bright yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its aromatic, resinous scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ability to retain its color when dried has made it a valued component in floral arrangements."
