    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion valmierense, commonly known as the Valmierense hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a hairy surface, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
