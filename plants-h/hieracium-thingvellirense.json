It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as grasslands and tundra. It has small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
