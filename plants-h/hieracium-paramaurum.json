    "intro": "Hieracium paramaurum, commonly known as the seaside hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found along shores and dunes. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in salty environments. Hieracium paramaurum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
