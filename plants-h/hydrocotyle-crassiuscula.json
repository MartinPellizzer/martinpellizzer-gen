    "intro": "Hydrocotyle crassiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter, with a waxy surface to help repel water. Its small, white flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle crassiuscula plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
