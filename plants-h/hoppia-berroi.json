    "intro": "Hoppia berroi, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant has strap-like, grassy leaves that are often mistaken for those of grasses or sedges. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Hoppia berroi is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
