    "intro": "Hypericum indecorum, commonly known as the false St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in summer, often attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types. Hypericum indecorum is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its medicinal properties are less well-documented compared to other Hypericum species."
