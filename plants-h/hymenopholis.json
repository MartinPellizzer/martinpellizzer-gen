    "intro": "Hymenopholis, commonly known as the rock fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, delicate fronds and are often found growing on rocky surfaces or in shaded, moist environments. Hymenophillis species typically have a unique structure with a thin, membranous lamina and a specialized rhizome system. They are often epiphytic or lithophytic, meaning they grow on other plants or rocks rather than in soil. The genus is known for its high diversity and is primarily distributed in tropical and subtropical regions."
