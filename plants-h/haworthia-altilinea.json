    "intro": "Haworthia altilinea, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, especially along the edges. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
