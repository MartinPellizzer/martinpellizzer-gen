    "intro": "Hexalectris warnockii f. flavida, commonly known as the yellow false morel, is a rare and striking member of the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, umbrella-like cap that is yellowish in color, contrasting with its dark, veined stem. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, adding to its visual appeal. It is typically found in shaded, moist forest environments, often growing in association with certain tree species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
