    "intro": "Hemionitis alata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive arrowhead-shaped leaves, which are typically bright green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats. Hemionitis alata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant."
