    "intro": "Helianthus californicus, commonly known as the California sunflower, is a native species of the Asteraceae family found in the western United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and has rough, hairy stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The California sunflower is an important nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
