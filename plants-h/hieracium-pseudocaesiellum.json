    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocaesiellum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, rough-textured leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread easily. It is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings due to its invasive potential."
