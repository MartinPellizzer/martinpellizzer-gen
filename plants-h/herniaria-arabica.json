    "intro": "Herniaria arabica, commonly known as sandspurry, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by small, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed ground. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a distinctive component of its native habitats."
