    "intro": "Hyptidendron asperrimum, commonly known as the rough hyptidendron, is a shrub native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and often nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant is distinguished by its rough, hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, and it produces pods that contain seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
