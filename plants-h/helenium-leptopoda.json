    "intro": "Helenium leptopoda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and swamps, and it thrives in full to partial sunlight. Its yellow-orange ray flowers are surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers, making it visually striking. Helenium leptopoda is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
