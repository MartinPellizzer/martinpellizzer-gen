It is characterized by its distinctive angular, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Hakea angulata is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments."
