    "intro": "Hymenophyllum caudiculatum var. caudatum, commonly known as the slender toothed fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear leaves with finely toothed margins, and it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its fronds. It is native to regions of Southeast Asia and is often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
