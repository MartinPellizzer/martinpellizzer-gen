    "intro": "Hexastylis heterophylla, commonly known as the variable threadleaf, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Aristolochiaceae family and is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves exhibit morphological variation, which is reflected in its common name. The flowers are often clustered in racemes and emit a faint, sometimes unpleasant odor to attract pollinators."
