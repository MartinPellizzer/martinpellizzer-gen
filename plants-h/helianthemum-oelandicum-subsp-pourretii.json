    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum subsp. pourretii, commonly known as the Oeland thyme, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wool, which helps to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate coastal conditions."
