    "intro": "Hymenophyllum exquisitum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in shaded, moist environments. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that give it a velvety appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a dense covering of fine trichomes. Hymenophyllum exquisitum plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to the understory vegetation and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
