It features small, gray-green leaves that are opposite and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its aromatic properties, it has been used historically in traditional medicine and as a source of essential oils."
