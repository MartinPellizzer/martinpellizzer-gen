    "intro": "Hedyotis lindleyana f. glabricalycina, commonly known as the glabrous-leaved blushing flower, is a variant of the species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless leaves and small, delicate white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture in humid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
