    "intro": "Hypocistis lutea, commonly known as the yellow swallowwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds with a tuft of hair for wind dispersal. Hypocistis lutea is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
