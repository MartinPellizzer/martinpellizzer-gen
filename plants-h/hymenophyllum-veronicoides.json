    "intro": "Hymenophyllum veronicoides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum veronicoides is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
