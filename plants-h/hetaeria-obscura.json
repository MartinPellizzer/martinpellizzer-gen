    "intro": "Hetaeria obscura, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic epiphytic orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It possesses a unique morphology, with a slender, leafless stem and a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree bark. Its flowers are typically small and delicate, with a distinct, almost translucent appearance. Due to its elusive nature and habitat specificity, Hetaeria obscura is considered a critically endangered species."
