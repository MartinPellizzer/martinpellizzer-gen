    "intro": "Hamosa goldmanii, commonly known as the golden hamosa, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers, which bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hamosa goldmanii is considered a conservation concern."
