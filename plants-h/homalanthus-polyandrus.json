    "intro": "Homalanthus polyandrus, commonly known as the African fevervine, is a climbing shrub native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its slender, twining stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed capsules. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
