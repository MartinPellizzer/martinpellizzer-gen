    "intro": "Habenaria coeloglossoides, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, white, thread-like flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Its leaves are long and strap-like, adapted to capture moisture from the air. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is highly valued in both botanical research and conservation efforts."
