    "intro": "Haworthia latericia, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. Haworthia latericia is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
