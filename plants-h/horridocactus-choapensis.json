    "intro": "Horridocactus choapensis, commonly known as the Choapense cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the cloud forests of western Costa Rica. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stem and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a slow growth rate and is adapted to the humid, shaded conditions of its natural habitat. Its thick, fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in the wet, tropical environment. Horridocactus choapensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
