    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. pullum, commonly known as the Scottish twayblade, is a rare orchid species native to the Scottish Highlands. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a distinctive leafless stem and a single, showy violet-blue flower. The plant thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is typically found in heathland and moorland habitats. It has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which help it absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
