    "intro": "Hemiadelphis polysperma var. joshiana, commonly known as the Joshana starfish flower, is a unique member of the Apocynaceae family, native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking, star-shaped flowers that resemble miniature starfish, hence its common name. The leaves are typically ovate with a waxy texture, and the plant often grows in shaded, humid environments. It produces small, fleshy fruits that contain multiple seeds, contributing to its reproductive strategy. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
