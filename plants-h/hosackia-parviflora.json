    "intro": "Hosackia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered hoary vetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its hairy stems and small, yellow pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open grasslands and along stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hosackia parviflora plays a role in soil stabilization and provides nectar for pollinators in its native range."
