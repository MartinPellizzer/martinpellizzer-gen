    "intro": "Hoya moninae, commonly known as the \"White Lady\" or \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya moninae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
