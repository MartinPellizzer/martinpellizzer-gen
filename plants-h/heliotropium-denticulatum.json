It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of purple and white. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in disturbed areas. Heliotropium denticulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
