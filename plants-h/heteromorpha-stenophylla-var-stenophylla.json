    "intro": "Heteromorpha stenophylla var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heteromorpha, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
