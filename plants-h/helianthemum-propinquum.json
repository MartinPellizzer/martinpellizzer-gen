    "intro": "Helianthemum propinquum, commonly known as the common rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically appearing in clusters along the stems. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Helianthemum propinquum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in challenging environments."
