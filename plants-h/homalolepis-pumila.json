    "intro": "Homalolepis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf fern or small-leafed fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the undersides of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a common feature among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or on rocky outcrops. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a distinctive member of the fern family."
