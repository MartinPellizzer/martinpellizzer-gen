    "intro": "Hohenbergia strobilacea, commonly known as the Christmas fern, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its foliage is often used in floral arrangements due to its elegant appearance. Hohenbergia strobilacea thrives in shaded, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
