It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to harsh desert environments. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
