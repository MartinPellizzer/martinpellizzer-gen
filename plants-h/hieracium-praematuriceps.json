    "intro": "Hieracium praematuriceps, commonly known as the early yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, often becoming invasive in certain habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
