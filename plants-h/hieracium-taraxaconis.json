It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowering heads consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium taraxaconis is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia."
