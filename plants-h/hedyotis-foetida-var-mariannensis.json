    "intro": "Hedyotis foetida var. mariannensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian stinkbush, is a perennial herb native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in parts of its range."
