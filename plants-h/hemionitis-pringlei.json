    "intro": "Hemionitis pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern native to the arid regions of central China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils and requires a specific microhabitat with high humidity and cool temperatures. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis pringlei is critically endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts to prevent its extinction."
