    "intro": "Helianthemum reflexum, commonly known as the creeping sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its stems are prostrate, allowing it to spread across rocky or sandy soils. Helianthemum reflexum is well adapted to full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in xeriscaped landscapes."
