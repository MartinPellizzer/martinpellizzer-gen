    "intro": "Hypolepis alte-gracillima, commonly known as the tall slender fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with slender, wiry stems that produce numerous small, spore-bearing sorus clusters on the undersides of its leaves. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its graceful appearance and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant plays a role in forest ecosystems by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
