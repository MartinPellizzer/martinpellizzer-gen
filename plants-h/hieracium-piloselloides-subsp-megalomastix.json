    "intro": "Hieracium piloselloides subsp. megalomastix, commonly known as the giant meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect stems and basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain habitats."
