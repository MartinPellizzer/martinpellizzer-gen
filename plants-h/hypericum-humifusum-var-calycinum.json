    "intro": "Hypericum humifusum var. calycinum, commonly known as the golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has woody stems that are often covered in short, glandular hairs, and its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. The species is notable for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
