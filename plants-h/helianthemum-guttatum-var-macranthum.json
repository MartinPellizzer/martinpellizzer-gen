    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. macranthum, commonly known as the broad-flowered rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with a waxy coating, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding a striking visual contrast to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
