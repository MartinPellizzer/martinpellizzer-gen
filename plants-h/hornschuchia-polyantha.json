It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
