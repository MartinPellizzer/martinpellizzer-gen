It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a dark green color, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive dark center. It is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
