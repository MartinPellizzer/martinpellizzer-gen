    "intro": "Hypericum tomentosum var. dissitiflorum, commonly known as the woolly St. John's wort, is a herbaceous perennial shrub native to the western United States. It features dense, gray-green foliage covered in soft, woolly hairs, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are borne on short, erect stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. The botanical characteristics of this variety make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
