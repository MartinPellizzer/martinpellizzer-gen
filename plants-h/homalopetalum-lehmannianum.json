    "intro": "Homalopetalum lehmannianum, commonly known as the Lehmann's penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and showy, tubular flowers that range in color from violet to red. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
