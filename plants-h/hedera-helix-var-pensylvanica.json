    "intro": "Hedera helix var. pensylvanica, commonly known as the Pennsylvania ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for shaded garden areas. Its vigorous growth habit makes it an effective ground cover but requires regular pruning to prevent it from becoming invasive."
