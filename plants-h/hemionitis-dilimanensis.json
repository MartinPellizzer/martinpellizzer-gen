    "intro": "Hemionitis dilimanensis, commonly known as the Diliman hemionitis, is a rare fern species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically light green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to habitat loss, Hemionitis dilimanensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
