    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pectinatum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, moss-like fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a membranous shield. This species is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
