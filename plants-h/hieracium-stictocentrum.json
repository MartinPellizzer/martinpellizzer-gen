It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium stictocentrum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
