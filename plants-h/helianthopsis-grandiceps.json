    "intro": "Helianthopsis grandiceps, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that produces vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single, showy head at the end of each stem, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthopsis grandiceps is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a resilient species in desert ecosystems."
