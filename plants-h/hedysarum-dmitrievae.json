    "intro": "Hedysarum dmitrievae, commonly known as the Siberian milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces pods containing small, round seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe habitats. Hedysarum dmitrievae plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environment."
