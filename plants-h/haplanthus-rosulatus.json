    "intro": "Haplanthus rosulatus, commonly known as the rosette bellflower, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or purple, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
