    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. reclinatum, commonly known as the drooping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, including a more drooping growth habit."
