    "intro": "Hemionitis deboeri, commonly known as the Boeri's hemionitis, is a rare and endangered fern species native to the mountainous regions of central China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often growing in shaded, rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemionitis deboeri is critically important for conservation efforts in its native range."
