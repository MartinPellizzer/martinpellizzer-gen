    "intro": "Halimium concolor, commonly known as the purple sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing perennial herb with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its botanical features make it an attractive and resilient addition to xeriscaped gardens."
