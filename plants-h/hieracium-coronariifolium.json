    "intro": "Hieracium coronariifolium, commonly known as the crown-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems bear showy yellow flowers with pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
