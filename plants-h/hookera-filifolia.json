It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, silvery-green foliage and showy yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions with cool, moist conditions, often in rocky or alpine environments. Its flowers bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, Hookera filifolia is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
