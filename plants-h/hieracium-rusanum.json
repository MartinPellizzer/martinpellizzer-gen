    "intro": "Hieracium rusanum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow-orange disk flowers surrounded by yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Hieracium rusanum is known for its ability to thrive in disturbed habitats and can sometimes become invasive in non-native areas."
