    "intro": "Herniaria incana var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, fleshy, green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to conserve moisture. The plant produces tiny, white or pinkish flowers during the spring and summer months. Its roots are extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, sandy soils. This variety is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and is often found in Mediterranean and temperate regions."
