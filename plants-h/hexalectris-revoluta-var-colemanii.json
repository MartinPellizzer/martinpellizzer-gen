    "intro": "Hexalectris revoluta var. colemanii, commonly known as the Coleman's false dragonhead, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its tubular, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in pine forests or along stream banks. It produces a rosette of lance-shaped leaves and has a short, stout rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
