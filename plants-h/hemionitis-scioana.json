    "intro": "Hemionitis scioana, commonly known as the ghost fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of China and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of a true fern. The plant thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or among moss-covered substrates. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are borne on short, wiry stalks, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis scioana is considered a rare and endangered species."
