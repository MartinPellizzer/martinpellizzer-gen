    "intro": "Hyphaene multiformis subsp. kilvaensis, commonly known as the Kilva palm, is a species native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its robust, clustered growth habit and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of many palms. Its fruit is a large, fibrous drupe that contains a single seed, which is dispersed by water and animals. This subspecies is adapted to saline and coastal environments, making it an important component of coastal vegetation in its native range."
