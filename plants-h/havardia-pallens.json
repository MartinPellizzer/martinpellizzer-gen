    "intro": "Havardia pallens, commonly known as the silver maple, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and heart-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by winged seeds dispersed by the wind. Its root system is shallow, making it susceptible to drought and wind damage. The tree is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and rapid growth rate."
