    "intro": "Helichrysum argyrocephalum, commonly known as silverhead or goldenhead, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow or golden-orange flowers that persist through winter, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum argyrocephalum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
