    "intro": "Hieracium trachselianotropum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
