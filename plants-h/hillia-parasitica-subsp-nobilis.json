    "intro": "Hillia parasitica subsp. nobilis, commonly known as the noble hillia, is a hemiparasitic plant belonging to the family Orobanchaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, woody stem with opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in spikes, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. This subspecies is notable for its specialized relationship with host plants, drawing nutrients through haustoria."
