    "intro": "Hieracium ochrochlorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are typical features of many species in the genus Hieracium. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, contributing to its widespread distribution across its native range."
