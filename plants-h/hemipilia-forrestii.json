    "intro": "Hemipilia forrestii, commonly known as the Chinese orchid, is a rare and delicate member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of western China, particularly in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. The plant features slender, wiry stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. Its flowers are small and pale greenish-yellow, with a distinctive three-lobed lip that adds to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia forrestii is considered a rare and endangered species."
