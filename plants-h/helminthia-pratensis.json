    "intro": "Helminthia pratensis, commonly known as the meadow helminth, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant has slender, branching stems and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a feathery appearance, and it produces small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Helminthia pratensis plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
