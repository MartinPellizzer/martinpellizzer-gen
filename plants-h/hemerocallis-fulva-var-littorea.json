    "intro": "Hemerocallis fulva var. littorea, commonly known as the coastal daylily, is a variant of the daylily that is adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. This plant is typically found in sandy or muddy soils along the shores of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. It is a short-lived perennial that thrives in full sun and is often used in coastal landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value. The flowers open during the day and close at night, a trait common to many daylilies."
