    "intro": "Hieracium longimanum, commonly known as the long-fingered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium longimanum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
