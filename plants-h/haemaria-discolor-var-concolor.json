    "intro": "Haemaria discolor var. concolor, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironwood, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that remain smooth and uniform in texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable plant for xeriscaping and ecological restoration projects."
