    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. saetabense, commonly known as the serrated rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are characterized by their serrated edges and aromatic scent, which is reminiscent of oregano. This subspecies is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
