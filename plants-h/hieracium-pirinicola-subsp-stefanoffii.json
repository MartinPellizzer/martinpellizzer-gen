It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous ray florets that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
