    "intro": "Humboltia prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate humboldtia, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Humboltia prostrata thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and wind exposure. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
