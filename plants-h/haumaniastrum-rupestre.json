    "intro": "Haumaniastrum rupestre, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its hairy, succulent stems and basal leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in poor, rocky soils. Haumaniastrum rupestre is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in extreme conditions."
