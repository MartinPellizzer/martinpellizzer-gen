    "intro": "Helleborus liguricus, commonly known as the Ligurian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western Mediterranean region. It features dark green, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of nodding, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Helleborus liguricus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in cooler climates."
