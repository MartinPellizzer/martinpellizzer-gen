    "intro": "Heliabravoa, commonly known as the sun-bravoa, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow-orange petals and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in full sunlight and well-drained soils, often growing in rocky or sandy habitats. Its flowers bloom in late spring and early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heliabravoa is considered a vulnerable species."
