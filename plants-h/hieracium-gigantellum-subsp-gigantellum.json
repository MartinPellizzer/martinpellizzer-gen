    "intro": "Hieracium gigantellum subsp. gigantellum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a single, showy head, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a fibrous root system. This species is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
