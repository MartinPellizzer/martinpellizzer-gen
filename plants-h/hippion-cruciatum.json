    "intro": "Hippion cruciatum, commonly known as the cruciate thistle, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its robust, spiny stems and large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces purple to violet flowers in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves and stems contain latex, which can cause skin irritation. Hippion cruciatum is often found in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
