    "intro": "Haemanthus tenuiflorus var. coccineus, commonly known as the red-stemmed haemanthus, is a striking evergreen perennial native to South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base, and it produces striking red-brown flower stalks that bear small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant is notable for its vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that appear in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and dramatic floral display."
