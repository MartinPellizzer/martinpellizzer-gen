    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion breconicola, commonly known as the Brecon Heath Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the UK, particularly found in the Brecon Beacons. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and heathlands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in Wales."
