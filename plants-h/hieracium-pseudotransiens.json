    "intro": "Hieracium pseudotransiens, commonly known as the false hawksbeard, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, and its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium pseudotransiens is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
