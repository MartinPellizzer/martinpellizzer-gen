    "intro": "Hymenolaena alpina, commonly known as alpine hymenolaena, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces panicles of tiny, two-lipped flowers that are often pink or purple in color, which bloom during the cooler months. Hymenolaena alpina thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments with low temperatures and strong sunlight. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
