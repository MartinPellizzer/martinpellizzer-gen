    "intro": "Habenaria gabonensis var. psiloceras, commonly known as the Gabon orchid, is a species native to Central and West Africa. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-brown flowers that are typically arranged in a spike, with a distinctive lip that is often darker in color. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to grow in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
