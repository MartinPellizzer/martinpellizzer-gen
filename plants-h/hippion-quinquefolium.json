    "intro": "Hippion quinquefolium, commonly known as the five-leafed heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in clusters of five, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white or pink flowers during the winter months. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
