    "intro": "Hebe strictissima, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its upright, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and often have a silvery underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Hebe strictissima is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its compact size and drought tolerance."
