    "intro": "Haworthia heidelbergensis var. minor, commonly known as the Heidelberg Haworthia, is a compact, clumping succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with distinct white or silver markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
