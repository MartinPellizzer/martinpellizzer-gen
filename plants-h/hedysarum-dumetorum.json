    "intro": "Hedysarum dumetorum, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically heart-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by slender, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Hedysarum dumetorum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
