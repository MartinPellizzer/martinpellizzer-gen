    "intro": "Hodgkinsonia, commonly known as the \"giant water lily,\" is a prehistoric plant that thrived during the Cretaceous period. It is characterized by its massive, floating leaves that could reach up to three meters in diameter. The plant's structure includes a thick, spongy stem that supports its large leaves and helps it stay afloat. Its flowers, which were likely pollinated by insects, were relatively small compared to the size of its leaves. Hodgkinsonia is an important fossil plant that provides insights into ancient aquatic ecosystems."
