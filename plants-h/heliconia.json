    "intro": "Heliconia, commonly known as the lobster claw plant, is a tropical genus of flowering plants in the family Heliconiaceae. It is characterized by its vibrant, often colorful bracts that resemble lobster claws, which are actually modified leaves. These bracts serve as a protective covering for the small, true flowers that are usually clustered inside. Heliconia plants are native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America, and are often found in humid, tropical environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and are also important in some ecosystems as a food source for certain animals."
