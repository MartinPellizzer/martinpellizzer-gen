It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
