    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tripartita, commonly known as the three-part water arum, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the Americas. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a distinctive tripartite division. The plant produces small, white, spadix-like flowers that are surrounded by a hooded spathe, characteristic of the Araceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in aquatic habitats. Hydrocotyle tripartita is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
