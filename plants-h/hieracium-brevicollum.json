    "intro": "Hieracium brevicollum, commonly known as the short-necked hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the genus Hieracium. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in pollinator support in its native habitats."
