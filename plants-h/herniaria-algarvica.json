    "intro": "Herniaria algarvica, commonly known as the Algarve herniaria, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its prostrate habit and small, rounded leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal and semi-arid regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in southern Portugal."
