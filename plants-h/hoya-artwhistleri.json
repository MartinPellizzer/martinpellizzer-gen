    "intro": "Hoya artwhistleri, commonly known as the Artwhistler's Waxy Wonders, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically green with a slight variegation. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya artwhistleri is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
