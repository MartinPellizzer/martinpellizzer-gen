It is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a dense, daisy-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branching. Hieracium lactucaceum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
