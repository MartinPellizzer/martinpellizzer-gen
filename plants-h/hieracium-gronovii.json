    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii, commonly known as the Gronovii hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a single head. Native to Europe, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it conserve water in its arid environment. It is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain regions."
