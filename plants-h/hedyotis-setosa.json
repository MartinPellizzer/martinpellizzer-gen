    "intro": "Hedyotis setosa, commonly known as the slender bladdernut, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia and the Americas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, wiry stems. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate in shape, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis setosa is characterized by its unique, bladder-like structures on its stems, which are a distinguishing botanical feature."
