It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy and alternate, while the stems are often erect and branched. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing small yellow blooms that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
