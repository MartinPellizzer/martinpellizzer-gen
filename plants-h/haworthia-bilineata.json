    "intro": "Haworthia bilineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinct white or pale yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
