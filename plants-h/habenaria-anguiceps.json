    "intro": "Habenaria anguiceps, commonly known as the snakehead orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often twisted flower spikes that resemble a snake's head, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest habitats, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. The orchid's pseudobulbs and strap-like leaves are adaptations to its tropical environment, allowing it to thrive in humid, low-light conditions."
