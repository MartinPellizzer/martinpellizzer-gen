    "intro": "Heterotheca latifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces striking purple to pink flower heads in the summer. Heterotheca latifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
