    "intro": "Hieracium pistoriense, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium pistoriense is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and seeds, making it a somewhat invasive species in some regions."
