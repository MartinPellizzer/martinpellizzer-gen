    "intro": "Helianthella tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. Its yellow flowers bloom in the spring and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthella tenuifolia is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native range."
