    "intro": "Hordeum murinum subsp. montanum, commonly known as mouse barley, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as along roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and is often found in moist or calcareous environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green hue, and it produces wind-pollinated flowers. This subspecies is adapted to harsh conditions and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
