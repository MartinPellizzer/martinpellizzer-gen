    "intro": "Haworthia retusa subsp. emelyae, commonly known as the Emelyae Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
