    "intro": "Hieracium armerioides subsp. touvetii, commonly known as the touvet's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough texture, and the flower heads are yellow, consisting of numerous small florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
