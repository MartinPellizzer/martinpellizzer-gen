    "intro": "Hedera helix var. arborescens, commonly known as the silver-leaf ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery or whitish underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant is a climbing or trailing evergreen vine with tendrils that allow it to attach to surfaces. It produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
