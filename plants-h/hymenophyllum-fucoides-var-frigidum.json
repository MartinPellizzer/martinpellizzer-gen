It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 2 cm in length. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found on shaded rock surfaces or in crevices. Its leaves are densely packed and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. This variety is notable for its ability to survive in low-temperature conditions, making it a hardy species in temperate and subarctic regions."
