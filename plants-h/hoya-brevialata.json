    "intro": "Hoya brevialata, commonly known as the \"Little Waxy Hoya,\" is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features thick, waxy, ovate leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, giving it an attractive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya brevialata prefers well-draining soil and is relatively drought-tolerant, making it suitable for beginners."
