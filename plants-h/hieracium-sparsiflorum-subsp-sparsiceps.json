    "intro": "Hieracium sparsiflorum subsp. sparsiceps, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in sunny locations. The plant features upright stems with rough, hairy surfaces and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense cluster at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, elongated flower heads and sparse, spreading florets."
