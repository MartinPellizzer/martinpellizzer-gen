    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. embergeri, commonly known as the lesser cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and yellowish-green flowers. It is a biennial or short-lived perennial plant that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. The plant has a hollow, aromatic stem and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks, and it is known for its mild, parsley-like scent. Due to its appearance, it can be easily confused with other similar species in the same genus."
