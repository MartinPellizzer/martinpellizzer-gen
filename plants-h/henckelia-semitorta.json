    "intro": "Henckelia semitorta, commonly known as the slender henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid environment. The flowers are small and yellow, often arranged in a dense cluster, making it a visually distinct and ecologically important species in its habitat."
