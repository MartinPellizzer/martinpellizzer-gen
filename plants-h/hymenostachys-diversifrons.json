    "intro": "Hymenostachys diversifrons, commonly known as the variable bract fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are often adorned with small, scale-like structures called bracts. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in humid conditions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the undersides of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. The plant's botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
