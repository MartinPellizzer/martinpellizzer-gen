    "intro": "Hydnocarpus subfalcatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf ironwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Sapindaceae and is characterized by its hard, dense wood and compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody capsules that contain smooth, oval seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its slow growth and valuable timber, it is considered a threatened species in its natural habitat."
