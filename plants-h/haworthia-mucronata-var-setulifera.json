    "intro": "Haworthia mucronata var. setulifera, commonly known as the serrated Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with white or pale markings and a distinctive serrated margin. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
