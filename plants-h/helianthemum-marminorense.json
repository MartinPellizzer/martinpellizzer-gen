    "intro": "Helianthemum marminorense, commonly known as the Marmenorensis sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a member of the Cariophyllaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with high sunlight exposure. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in arid environments. Helianthemum marminorense is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
