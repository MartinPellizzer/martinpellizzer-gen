    "intro": "Hymenopappus nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. The species is part of the tribe Castilleeae and is characterized by its unique pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal."
