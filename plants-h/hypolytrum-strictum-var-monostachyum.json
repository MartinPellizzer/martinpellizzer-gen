    "intro": "Hypolytrum strictum var. monostachyum, commonly known as the narrow-leafed tussock grass, is a perennial herb native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in a single spike, which is a distinguishing feature of the varietal form. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
