It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive granular texture. The leaves are typically covered in small, white to pale green tubercles, giving it a unique appearance. It produces pale yellow to orange flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
