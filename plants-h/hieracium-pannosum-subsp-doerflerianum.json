    "intro": "Hieracium pannosum subsp. doerflerianum, commonly known as the Doerfler's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellowish to reddish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
