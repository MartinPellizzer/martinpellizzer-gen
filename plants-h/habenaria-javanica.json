    "intro": "Habenaria javanica, commonly known as the Java butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are fibrous and often form a dense network to anchor it in nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
