    "intro": "Hieracium anthochryseum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium anthochryseum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
