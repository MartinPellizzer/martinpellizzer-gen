    "intro": "Hedyotis multiglomerulata, commonly known as the clustered dotweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Southeast Asia. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis multiglomerulata thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
