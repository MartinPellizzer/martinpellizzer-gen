It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are often arranged in dense, spherical clusters. The plant is known for its aromatic foliage, which emits a subtle, spicy scent. Its flowers are particularly notable for their ability to retain their color and form when dried, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements. Helichrysum amorginum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often growing in rocky or coastal environments."
