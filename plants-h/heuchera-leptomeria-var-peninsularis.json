    "intro": "Heuchera leptomeria var. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular alumroot, is a rare and striking plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial with distinctive, palmate leaves that are often brightly colored, ranging from deep red to purple and green. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a desirable addition to woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
