    "intro": "Helichrysum catipes, commonly known as the Cape gold or everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, branched structure and small, yellow to orange flowers that remain open for an extended period. The plant produces fluffy, spherical seed heads that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal areas. The leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance."
