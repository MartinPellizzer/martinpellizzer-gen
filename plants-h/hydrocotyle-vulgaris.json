    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and moist environments. It has heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Its rhizomes allow it to spread rapidly, making it an invasive species in some regions. Hydrocotyle vulgaris plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
