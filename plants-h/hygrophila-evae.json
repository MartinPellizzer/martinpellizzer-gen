    "intro": "Hygrophila evae, commonly known as the Eave's hygrophila, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can anchor itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has long, slender leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern along its stems. Its flowers are small and yellow, typically appearing in clusters, and are adapted for pollination by insects. Hygrophila evae is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
