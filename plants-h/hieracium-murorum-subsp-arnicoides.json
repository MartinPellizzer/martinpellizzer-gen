    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. arnicoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and yellowish to orange flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
