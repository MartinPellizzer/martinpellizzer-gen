    "intro": "Hymenoxys acaulis var. glabra, commonly known as the smooth hymenoxys, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant features a compact, low-growing habit with no distinct stem, as the leaves are basal and form a rosette. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, adding visual interest to its drought-tolerant nature. The smooth, hairless surface of its stems and leaves is a distinguishing characteristic of this variant."
