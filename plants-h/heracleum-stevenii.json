    "intro": "Heracleum stevenii, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like inflorescences and hairy, ridged stems that can grow up to 5 meters in height. The plant has large, compound leaves that are deeply lobed and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its phototoxic sap, it is considered a noxious weed and can pose a danger to humans and animals."
