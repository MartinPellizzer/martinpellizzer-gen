It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters. Hieracium lancifolium is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
