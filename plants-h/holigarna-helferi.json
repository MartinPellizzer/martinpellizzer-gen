    "intro": "Holigarna helferi, commonly known as the Helfer's holigarna, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine regions. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pale green or yellowish in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil, often growing in rocky or gravelly substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
