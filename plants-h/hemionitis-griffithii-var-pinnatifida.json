    "intro": "Hemionitis griffithii var. pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemionitis, is a rare and specialized fern species native to the arid regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnatifid (bipinnate) fronds that are adapted to thrive in dry, rocky habitats. The plant has a unique growth form, with creeping rhizomes and small, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, powdery trichomes. It is primarily found in high-altitude environments, where it forms dense mats on rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
