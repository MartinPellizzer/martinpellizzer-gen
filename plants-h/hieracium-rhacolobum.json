    "intro": "Hieracium rhacolobum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy meadows and disturbed soils. It has a hairy stem and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas. Its botanical features make it an important plant for pollinators and a subject of ecological study."
