It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Its leaves are usually opposite and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often hairy as well. Heliotropium longiflorum is a herbaceous perennial that blooms throughout the growing season, making it a notable species in its native range."
