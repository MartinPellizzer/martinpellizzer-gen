It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees with fragrant, white or yellow flowers. The plants typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce fleshy, red or orange berries that are edible for some animals. Himatanthus species are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to a variety of soil types. They play an important role in local ecosystems and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
