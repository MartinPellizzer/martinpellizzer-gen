    "intro": "Hymenasplenium denticulatum, commonly known as the toothed spleenwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort found in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive appearance with leafy, moss-like structures that form dense, carpet-like mats. The leaves are typically narrow, with a serrated or toothed margin, contributing to its common name. It reproduces through spores, which are released from tiny, stalked capsules located on the stems. This plant is often found growing on rocks, soil, or decaying wood in temperate regions."
