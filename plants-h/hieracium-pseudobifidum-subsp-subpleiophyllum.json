    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. subpleiophyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
