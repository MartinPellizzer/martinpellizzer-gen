    "intro": "Hookera bivalvis, commonly known as the bivalve hooker, is a rare and unique plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale green, which bloom during the short growing season. Hookera bivalvis is a member of the Brassicaceae family, known for its cruciform flowers and often edible seeds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
