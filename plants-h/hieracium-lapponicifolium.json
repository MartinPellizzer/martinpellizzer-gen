    "intro": "Hieracium lapponicifolium, commonly known as the Lapland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arctic and alpine regions of northern Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, rocky or sandy habitats, often in mountainous areas where the climate is cool and short-growing seasons prevail. The plant has basal leaves that are usually spoon-shaped or heart-shaped, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is characterized by its fibrous root system and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its cold tolerance, it is an important component of tundra and alpine vegetation."
