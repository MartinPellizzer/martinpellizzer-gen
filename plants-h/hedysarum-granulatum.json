    "intro": "Hedysarum granulatum, commonly known as the granulate peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces yellowish to reddish flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, spherical pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum granulatum thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
