It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, glandular hairs, which give the plant its varietal name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
