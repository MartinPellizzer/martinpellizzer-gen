    "intro": "Hemionitis angelica, commonly known as the angel's tears, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble droplets of water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Hemionitis angelica is under significant threat of extinction."
