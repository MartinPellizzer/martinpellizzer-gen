    "intro": "Hypericum montanum var. triphyllum, commonly known as the three-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has opposite, three-lobed leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
