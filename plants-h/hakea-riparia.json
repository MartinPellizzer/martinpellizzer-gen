    "intro": "Hakea riparia, commonly known as the river hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching stems and narrow, needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, urn-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Hakea riparia is often found near water sources such as rivers and wetlands, which contribute to its unique ecological role in these habitats."
