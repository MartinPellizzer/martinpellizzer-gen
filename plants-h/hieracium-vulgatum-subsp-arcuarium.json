    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. arcuarium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grasslands. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are usually alternate, with a rough, hairy texture. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
