    "intro": "Hylophila cheangii, commonly known as the Cheang's water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant has delicate, finely divided fronds that float on the water surface, with some leaves submerged. It is characterized by its unique reproductive structures and is often found in shaded, nutrient-rich environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
