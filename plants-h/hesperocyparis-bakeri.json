    "intro": "Hesperocyparis bakeri, commonly known as the Baker's incense cedar, is a rare conifer native to the coastal regions of Oregon and northern California. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and bluish-green foliage that turns a striking coppery hue in the fall. The plant produces small, spherical cones that release wind-dispersed seeds, contributing to its limited distribution. Hesperocyparis bakeri is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests with a mild, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss and its restricted range, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
