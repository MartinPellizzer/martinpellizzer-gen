    "intro": "Habenella ornithoides, commonly known as the bird's nest fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery, strap-like leaves that form a dense rosette resembling a bird's nest. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that anchors it to trees or rocks in its natural habitat. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
