    "intro": "Hymenophyllum francii, commonly known as the French haircap moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually arranged in a spiral pattern, and the spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are borne on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum francii is notable for its intricate morphology and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
