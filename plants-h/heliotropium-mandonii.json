    "intro": "Heliotropium mandonii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers that bloom in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to access deep underground water sources. Heliotropium mandonii is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
