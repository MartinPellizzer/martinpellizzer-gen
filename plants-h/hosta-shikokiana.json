    "intro": "Hosta shikokiana, commonly known as the Shikoku hosta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Japan. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically a deep green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late summer, which are clustered in loose racemes. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its striking foliage and modest floral display."
