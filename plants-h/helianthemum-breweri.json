    "intro": "Helianthemum breweri, commonly known as the Brewer's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cistaceae. It is native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States, particularly in New Mexico and Texas. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, hairy stems, and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically small, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. Helianthemum breweri is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
