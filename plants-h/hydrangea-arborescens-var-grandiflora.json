It features large, showy panicles of white or pink flowers that change color based on soil pH, a characteristic known as chlorophyll breakdown. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its foliage turns vibrant red or orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
