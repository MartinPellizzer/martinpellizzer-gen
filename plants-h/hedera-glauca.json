    "intro": "Hedera glauca, commonly known as the blue ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to southern China and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by orange-red berries. Hedera glauca is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and ease of care. It thrives in shaded environments and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
