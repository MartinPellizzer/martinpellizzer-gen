It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces smooth, spherical berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Hypargyrium canum is typically found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun. It is often used in traditional medicine, though its toxicity requires caution."
