It is a biennial or perennial herb native to parts of Asia, including Siberia and Central Asia. The plant features a tall, hollow stem with large, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its flowers are small, white to greenish-yellow, and arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. This plant is often found in moist meadows, riverbanks, and other damp habitats."
