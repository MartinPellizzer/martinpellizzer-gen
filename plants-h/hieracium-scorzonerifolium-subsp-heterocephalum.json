    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. heterocephalum, commonly known as the heterocephalous hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a distinct central disc. This subspecies is distinguished by its variable flower head morphology, contributing to its classification as heterocephalous."
