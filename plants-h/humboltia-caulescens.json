    "intro": "Humboltia caulescens, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in summer and attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Humboltia caulescens is well-suited to harsh environments, with its deep root system and ability to store water in its leaves and stems. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for desert wildlife."
