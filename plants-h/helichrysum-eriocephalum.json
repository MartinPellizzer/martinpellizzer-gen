    "intro": "Helichrysum eriocephalum, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming, giving it its common name. The plant has silvery-gray foliage and is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its durability. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum eriocephalum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
