    "intro": "Helietta trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leafed helietta, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which are usually oval or elliptical in shape. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Helietta trifoliata is often found in association with other moisture-loving plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
