    "intro": "Hieracium levieri, commonly known as the Levieri's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, this plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along woodland edges. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The plant is often found in nutrient-poor soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain habitats."
