    "intro": "Hyperacanthus, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a striking member of the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its large, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 feet in length. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in the summer. Native to the southeastern United States, it thrives in moist, shady environments. Its unique appearance and slow growth make it a popular choice for ornamental gardens."
