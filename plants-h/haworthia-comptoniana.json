    "intro": "Haworthia comptoniana, commonly known as the Compton's Haworthia, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, pale green to blue-gray leaves with white tubercles and translucent windows, which aid in photosynthesis. The plant produces tall, branched flower stalks that bear white or pale yellow flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
