    "intro": "Heterospathe parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered heterospathe, is a tropical plant native to the wetlands of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and marshes. The plant features delicate, narrow leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its flowers are small, white or pale green, and clustered in inflorescences. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in regions with consistent moisture and warm temperatures."
