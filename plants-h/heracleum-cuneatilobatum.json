    "intro": "Heracleum cuneatilobatum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbrella-like inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is native to temperate regions of Asia and features tall, hollow stems with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into slender, dry fruits called schizocarps. Its leaves and roots contain compounds that can be toxic if ingested, though they are sometimes used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, open habitats and is often found in meadows and along streambanks."
