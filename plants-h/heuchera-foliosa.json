    "intro": "Heuchera foliosa, commonly known as the silver leaf heuchera, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, silver-gray foliage that contrasts beautifully with its upright, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and prefers moist, well-drained soil in partial to full shade. Its leaves are usually oval or lance-shaped, with a velvety texture that adds to its ornamental appeal. Heuchera foliosa is valued in gardens for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in woodland environments."
