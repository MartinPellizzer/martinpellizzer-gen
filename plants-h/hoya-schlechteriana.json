    "intro": "Hoya schlechteriana, commonly known as the silver star hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a silvery or white veining. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom infrequently. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya schlechteriana is popular among plant enthusiasts for its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
