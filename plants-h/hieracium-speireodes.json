    "intro": "Hieracium speireodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Hieracium speireodes is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
