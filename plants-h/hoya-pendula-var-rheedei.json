    "intro": "Hoya pendula var. rheedei, commonly known as the hanging wax plant, is a unique and striking species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that can reach several meters in length, making it ideal for hanging baskets or trained growth. The plant produces waxy, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are thick, glossy, and often have a slight curl, contributing to its ornamental appeal. This variety is relatively low-maintenance, thriving in bright, indirect light and requiring minimal watering."
