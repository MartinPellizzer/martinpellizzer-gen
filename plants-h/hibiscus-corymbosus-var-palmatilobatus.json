    "intro": "Hibiscus corymbosus var. palmatilobatus, commonly known as the broad-lobed hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The foliage is typically a deep green with a slightly serrated edge, providing a lush, textured appearance. Its flowers are showy, with five to seven petals that range from white to pink, often with a yellow or red center. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes in gardens and as a houseplant."
