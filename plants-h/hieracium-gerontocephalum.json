    "intro": "Hieracium gerontocephalum, commonly known as the old man's beard, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and distinctive, drooping flower heads that resemble a beard. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by numerous tubular disc florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Its fibrous roots and robust growth make it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
