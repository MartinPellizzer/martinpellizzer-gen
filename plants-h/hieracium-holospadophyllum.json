    "intro": "Hieracium holospadophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is native to Europe and parts of western Asia. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellowish to reddish flower heads that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
