    "intro": "Hopea squamata, commonly known as the silver hopea, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and elongated, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green on top. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, spiky fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Hopea squamata is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in furniture and construction."
