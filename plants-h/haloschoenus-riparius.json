    "intro": "Haloschoenus riparius, commonly known as the river sedge, is a flowering plant native to wetland and riparian habitats in Australia. It is a perennial herb with narrow, grass-like leaves that form dense clumps, often growing in shallow water or moist soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish flowers arranged in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and stabilize riverbanks, preventing erosion. Haloschoenus riparius plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and terrestrial wildlife in its habitat."
