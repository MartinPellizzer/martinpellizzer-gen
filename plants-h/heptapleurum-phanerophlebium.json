    "intro": "Heptapleurum phanerophlebium, commonly known as the broad-leafed stonecrop, is a perennial evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is also cultivated in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and low maintenance requirements."
