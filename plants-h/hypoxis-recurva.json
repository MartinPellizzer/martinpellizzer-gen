It features a short, creeping rhizome and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers that bloom at night. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodland or grassland habitats. Hypoxis recurva is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
