It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy basal rosettes. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium montolearense is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often arid environment."
