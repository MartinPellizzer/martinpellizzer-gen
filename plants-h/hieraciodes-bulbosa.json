    "intro": "Hieraciodes bulbosa, commonly known as the bulbous bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features basal rosettes of fleshy, gray-green leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Hieraciodes bulbosa is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a container plant due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
