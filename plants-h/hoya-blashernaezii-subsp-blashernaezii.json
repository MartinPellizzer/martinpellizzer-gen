    "intro": "Hoya blashernaezii subsp. blashernaezii, commonly known as the Blashernaezii Hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight sheen. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. The subspecies is noted for its compact growth habit and ability to form offsets, making it easy to propagate."
