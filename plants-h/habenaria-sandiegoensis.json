It is characterized by its dark green, grass-like leaves and produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive lip. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and chaparral. It is a perennial species that blooms from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
