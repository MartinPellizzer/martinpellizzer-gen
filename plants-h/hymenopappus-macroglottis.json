    "intro": "Hymenopappus macroglottis, commonly known as the broad-leafed hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often clustered at the base. Its pale yellow to orange flowers bloom in summer, and the plant produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds that aid in its propagation. Hymenopappus macroglottis is adapted to arid environments and plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife."
