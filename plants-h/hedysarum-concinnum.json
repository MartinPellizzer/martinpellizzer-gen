    "intro": "Hedysarum concinnum, commonly known as the redstem locoweed, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to reddish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum concinnum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in sagebrush steppe ecosystems. It has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions and can fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility."
