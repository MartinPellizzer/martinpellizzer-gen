    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ulugurensis, commonly known as the Uluguru moonflower, is a tropical plant native to the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and fragrant white flowers that bloom at night. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that contain seeds. Hydrocotyle ulugurensis is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
