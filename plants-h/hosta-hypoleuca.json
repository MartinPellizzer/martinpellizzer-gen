    "intro": "Hosta hypoleuca, commonly known as the white hosta, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asparagaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that are often white to light green in color. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Hosta hypoleuca is valued for its ornamental foliage and is relatively low maintenance once established."
