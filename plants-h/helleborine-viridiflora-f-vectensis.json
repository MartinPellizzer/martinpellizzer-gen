    "intro": "Helleborine viridiflora f. vectensis, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a rare and striking orchid species native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its elongated, grass-like foliage and striking greenish-yellow flowers with distinctive veining. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as woodlands and rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its delicate, spurred petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in many areas."
