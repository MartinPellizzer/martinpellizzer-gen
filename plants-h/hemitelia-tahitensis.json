    "intro": "Hemitelia tahitensis, commonly known as Tahitian hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers that are often fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Hemitelia tahitensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as coastal forests and rocky crevices."
