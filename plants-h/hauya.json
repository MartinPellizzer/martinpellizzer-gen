    "intro": "Hauya, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes other hibiscus species and cotton. The plant is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. Hauya thrives in hot, dry environments and is adapted to store water in its thick, fleshy stems. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss."
