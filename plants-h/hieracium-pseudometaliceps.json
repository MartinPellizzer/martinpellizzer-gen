    "intro": "Hieracium pseudometaliceps, commonly known as the false metalwort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its dandelion-like yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It produces a milky sap that can be irritating to the skin, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
