    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. dufftii, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cold, harsh environments. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in mountainous areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
