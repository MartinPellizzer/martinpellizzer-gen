    "intro": "Hieracium rufescens, commonly known as the red-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. The flowers are yellow, with a pale red or brownish hue at the base, and bloom from late spring to early autumn."
