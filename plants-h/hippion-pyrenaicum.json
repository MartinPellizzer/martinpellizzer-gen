    "intro": "Hippion pyrenaicum, commonly known as the Pyrenean bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine pubescence, while its stems are erect and somewhat branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
