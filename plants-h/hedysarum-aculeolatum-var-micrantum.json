    "intro": "Hedysarum aculeolatum var. micrantum, commonly known as the prickly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
