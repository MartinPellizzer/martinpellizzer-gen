    "intro": "Hubera nitidissima, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, particularly Central and South America. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a velvety texture. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Hubera nitidissima is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields due to its adaptability and rapid growth rate."
