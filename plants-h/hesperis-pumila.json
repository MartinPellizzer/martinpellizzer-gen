    "intro": "Hesperis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf honesty, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by distinctive white, papery seed pods. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few inches, making it well-suited for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, with a slightly hairy texture. Hesperis pumila is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils."
