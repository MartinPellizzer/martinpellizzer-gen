    "intro": "Haworthia olivettiana, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a small, compact succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are typically green with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Due to its low maintenance requirements, it is well-suited for beginners and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
