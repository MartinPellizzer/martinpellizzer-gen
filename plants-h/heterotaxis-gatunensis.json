    "intro": "Heterotaxis gatunensis, commonly known as the Gatun heterotaxis, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often lobed and have a velvety texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
