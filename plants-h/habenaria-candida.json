    "intro": "Habenaria candida, commonly known as the white orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The flowers bloom in late spring or early summer, adding a delicate ornamental value to its natural habitat."
