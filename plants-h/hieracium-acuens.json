    "intro": "Hieracium acuens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas.

Hieracium acuens is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
