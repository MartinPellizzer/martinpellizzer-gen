    "intro": "Hymenophyllum brassii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically covered in a silvery, waxy coating. This coating helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitats. The plant is native to various regions in the Pacific, including New Zealand, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks."
