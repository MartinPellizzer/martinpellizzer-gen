    "intro": "Hexuris caudata, commonly known as the trailing arnoldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its spreading habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant features linear, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Hexuris caudata is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground covers."
