    "intro": "Hygrophila hygrophiloides, commonly known as water hygrophila, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically oval to lance-shaped. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often arranged in spikes. It thrives in wet or aquatic environments, such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Hygrophila hygrophiloides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
