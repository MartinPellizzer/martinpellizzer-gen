    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. fontanalbae, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is native to specific regions in the Mediterranean, particularly in southern Italy. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and open woodlands. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local flora, though it is relatively rare and often overlooked due to its subtle appearance."
