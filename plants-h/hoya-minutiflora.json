    "intro": "Hoya minutiflora, commonly known as the baby hoya, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, waxy, waxy, and fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya minutiflora is popular among indoor gardeners for its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
