    "intro": "Heliconia glauca, commonly known as the blue heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, banana-like inflorescence that consists of brightly colored, fleshy bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which serve as a nectar source for pollinators. Heliconia glauca thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure and vibrant appearance make it a popular ornamental plant in horticulture."
