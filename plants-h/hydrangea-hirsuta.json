    "intro": "Hydrangea hirsuta, commonly known as the rough hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Hydrangea hirsuta is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
