    "intro": "Helena croceorincta, commonly known as the golden throat orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers with a distinctive orange throat, which gives it its common name. It thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Helena croceorincta is considered a vulnerable species."
