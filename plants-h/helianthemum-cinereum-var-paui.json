    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum var. paui, commonly known as the purple sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has gray-green, woolly leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
