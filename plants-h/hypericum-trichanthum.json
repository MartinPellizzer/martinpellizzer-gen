    "intro": "Hypericum trichanthum, commonly known as yellow hypericum, is a perennial shrub native to eastern North America. It features woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in cymes. Its botanical name reflects its hairy stems and yellow flowers, with \"trichanthum\" referring to the hairy appearance. It is often found in moist woodlands and along streambanks, where it thrives in partial to full shade."
