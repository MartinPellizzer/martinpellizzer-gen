    "intro": "Hieracium urvellei, commonly known as the Urvelle's hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, which is a common feature among members of the daisy family. It is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in grassy habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
