    "intro": "Hemihabenaria stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Asia, particularly India and Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as marshes and along riverbanks. The plant features a slender, wiry stem and produces small, greenish-white flowers with three petals and three sepals. Its roots are often colonized by mycorrhizal fungi, which play a crucial role in its nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its unique floral structure and ecological adaptation to wetland habitats."
