    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bicolanum, commonly known as the two-colored filmy fern, is a small epiphytic or lithophytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The fronds are usually dichotomously branched and have a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. The plant's unique appearance and ecological niche make it a fascinating subject for botanists and enthusiasts alike."
