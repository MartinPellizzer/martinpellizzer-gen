It is characterized by its striking red to pink flowers that bloom in clusters along the stems, typically in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its showy inflorescences attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value."
