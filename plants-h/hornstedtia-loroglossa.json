    "intro": "Hornstedtia loroglossa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its unique floral structure includes a distinctive, elongated lip that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
