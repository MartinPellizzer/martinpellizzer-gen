    "intro": "Hedysarum granuliferum, commonly known as the granular milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert scrub habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments. Hedysarum granuliferum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in restoration projects."
