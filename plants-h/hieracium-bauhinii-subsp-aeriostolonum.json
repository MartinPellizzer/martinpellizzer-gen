It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It spreads through stolons, forming dense mats that can dominate grasslands. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and a target for invasive plant management."
