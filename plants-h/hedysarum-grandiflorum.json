    "intro": "Hedysarum grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It produces striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in racemes along the stems. The plant has trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets, and its root system is often extensive, contributing to soil stabilization. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or rocky areas. Hedysarum grandiflorum is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators."
