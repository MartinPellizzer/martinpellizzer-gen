    "intro": "Hydrocharis cellulosa, commonly known as the water clover, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, thread-like hairs, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that float on the water surface, typically blooming in the early morning. Hydrocharis cellulosa thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
