    "intro": "Hariota parasitica, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the Indian subcontinent. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while still performing some photosynthesis using limited chlorophyll. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers and red berries that are dispersed by birds. Its parasitic nature can weaken the host tree over time, though it does not typically cause immediate death. Hariota parasitica is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in dense forests where it thrives in shaded environments."
