    "intro": "Herniaria lenticulata var. diandra, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to arid and rocky environments. It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to harsh, dry conditions and is often found in coastal dunes and sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of xerophytic ecosystems."
