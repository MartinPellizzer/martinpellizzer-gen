    "intro": "Heliotropium bacciferum var. suberosum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which is a notable botanical feature. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas or along roadsides. Its unique morphology and chemical composition make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
