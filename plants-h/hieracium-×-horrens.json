    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 horrens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
