    "intro": "Helopus acuminatus, commonly known as the sharp-pointed helopus, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are typically borne in terminal panicles. Its fruit is a small, dry capsule that splits open to release minute seeds. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in tropical gardens."
