    "intro": "Helleborus niger var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces striking, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often around Christmas, hence its common name. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. The plant is noted for its slow growth and long lifespan, making it a valuable addition to perennial plant collections."
