    "intro": "Helianthemum violaceum f. minutifolium, commonly known as the dwarf purple rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of small, violet-pink flowers in early summer, adding a delicate color to rocky or gravelly habitats. It is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
