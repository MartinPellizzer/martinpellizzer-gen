    "intro": "Heliotropium gypsaceum, commonly known as the gypsum heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically range in color from pink to purple, and it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is often found growing in disturbed areas, such as along roadsides or in dry fields. Heliotropium gypsaceum is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats."
