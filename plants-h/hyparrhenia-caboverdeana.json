    "intro": "Hyparrhenia caboverdeana, commonly known as the Cape Verde grass, is a perennial grass species native to the Cape Verde Islands. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Hyparrhenia caboverdeana is often used in landscaping and erosion control due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
