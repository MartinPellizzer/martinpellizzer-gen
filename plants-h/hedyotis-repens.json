    "intro": "Hedyotis repens, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hedyotis repens is often found in disturbed soils, along pathways, and in open woodlands, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
