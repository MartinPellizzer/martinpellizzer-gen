    "intro": "Hieracium ucenicum, commonly known as the Ucenic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its yellowish-orange flowers appear in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium ucenicum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
