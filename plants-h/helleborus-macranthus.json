    "intro": "Helleborus macranthus, commonly known as the giant hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Europe. It is characterized by its large, dark green, palmately lobed leaves and its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces berries that are toxic to humans and animals, making it important to handle with care. Helleborus macranthus thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a suitable addition to shady garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting, elegant flowers that add interest to gardens during the winter months."
