    "intro": "Habenaria angustiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the wetlands and marshes of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 15-30 cm, featuring slender, grass-like leaves and a single, slender spike of flowers. The flowers are usually pale green to white with a distinctive, three-lobed lip, and they bloom during the summer months. This species is adapted to moist, nutrient-poor soils and often thrives in shaded environments. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to wetland ecosystems, making it a characteristic member of the Orchidaceae family."
