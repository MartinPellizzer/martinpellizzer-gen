    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. latirevelatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its wider leaves compared to standard barley varieties. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is primarily cultivated for its grains, which are used in food and animal feed. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with dense, cylindrical spikelets that contain the edible grains. Its botanical features include hollow stems, parallel-veined leaves, and a fibrous root system typical of grasses. This variety is well adapted to temperate climates and is often grown in regions with moderate rainfall."
