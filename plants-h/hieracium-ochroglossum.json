    "intro": "Hieracium ochroglossum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium ochroglossum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
