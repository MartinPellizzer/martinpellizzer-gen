    "intro": "Hieracium brevivestitum, commonly known as the short-habited hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and along stream banks. It has a low-growing habit and is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance. Hieracium brevivestitum is a perennial plant that spreads through rhizomes and is relatively hardy in temperate climates."
