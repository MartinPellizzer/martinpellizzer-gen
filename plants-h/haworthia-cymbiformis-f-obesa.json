It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique foliage, it is a popular choice among succulent enthusiasts."
