    "intro": "Hypolepis bivalvis, commonly known as the two-lobed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bi-lobed fronds that are typically pinnately compound. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water bodies such as streams and ponds. Its spores are produced on the undersides of the fronds in clusters called sori. The structure of its rhizomes and the arrangement of its leaves are key features in its classification within the family Blechnaceae."
