It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a single head. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
