    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. constrictiforme, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This subspecies is typically found in specific microhabitats, often in calcareous soils, which support its unique ecological requirements. Its morphology includes a low-growing habit with multiple flowering stems. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat needs, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered plant."
