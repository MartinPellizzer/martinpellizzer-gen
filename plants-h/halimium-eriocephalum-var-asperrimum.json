    "intro": "Halimium eriocephalum var. asperrimum, commonly known as the rough-haired hound's-tongue, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features a basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves that are often covered in glandular trichomes, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered in dense, spherical formations. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and naturalized areas."
