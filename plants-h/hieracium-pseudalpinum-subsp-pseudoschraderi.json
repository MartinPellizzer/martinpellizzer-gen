The plant has bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, cold environments, making it a common sight in mountainous areas. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand strong winds and low temperatures."
