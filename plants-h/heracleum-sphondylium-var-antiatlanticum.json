    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. antiatlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to western Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and riverbanks. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves with a hairy texture and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its robust growth and potential to become invasive in certain environments."
