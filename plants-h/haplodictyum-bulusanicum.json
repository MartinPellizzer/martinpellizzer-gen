    "intro": "Haplodictyum bulusanicum, commonly known as the Bulusan moss, is a rare and specialized liverwort species found in specific tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Porellaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate, and often clustered growth form. The plant typically grows on moist, shaded substrates such as rocks or tree trunks, thriving in humid environments. Its reproductive structures are highly adapted for spore dispersal, and it plays a role in the ecological balance of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental conditions."
