    "intro": "Hieracium flocciferum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its hairy leaves and stems help it retain moisture and resist herbivory. The plant is often found in open habitats and is considered a common weed in some regions."
