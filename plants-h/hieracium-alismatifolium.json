    "intro": "Hieracium alismatifolium, commonly known as the waterleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single capitulum, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in wet meadows, riverbanks, and marshy areas. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
