    "intro": "Habenaria elongata var. leptophylla, commonly known as the slender-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and forest floors. The plant features long, narrow leaves and produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinct lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
