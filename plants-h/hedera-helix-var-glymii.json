    "intro": "Hedera helix var. glymii, commonly known as the English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover surfaces. However, it can be invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
