    "intro": "Humiriastrum melanocarpum, commonly known as the black-fruited muhly, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are a key feature of its reproductive cycle. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Humiriastrum melanocarpum is often found in grasslands and along the edges of desert washes."
