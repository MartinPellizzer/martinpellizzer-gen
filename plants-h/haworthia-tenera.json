It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are fleshy and covered in white tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It produces small, white or greenish flowers on tall stalks during the warmer months. Haworthia tenera is popular as a low-maintenance indoor plant due to its hardy nature and aesthetic appeal."
