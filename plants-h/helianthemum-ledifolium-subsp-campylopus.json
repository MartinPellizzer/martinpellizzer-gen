    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium subsp. campylopus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to withstand arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic environments and garden settings with limited water availability."
