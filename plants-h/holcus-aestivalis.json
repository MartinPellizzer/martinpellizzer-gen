It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant has flat, narrow leaves and produces spikelets that are arranged in loose clusters along the stem. Its flowering period occurs in the summer months, and it is often found in open habitats with moderate to high moisture levels. Holcus aestivalis is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect and bird populations."
