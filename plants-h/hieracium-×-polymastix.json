    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 polymastix, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its flowering stems. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it often becomes an invasive species. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, it can outcompete native vegetation."
