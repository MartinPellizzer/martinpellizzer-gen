    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum var. latifolium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a tropical climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf morphology, featuring specialized structures called domatia that provide shelter for ants. These ants, in turn, protect the plant from herbivores and help in nutrient acquisition through their waste. The plant forms symbiotic relationships with various ant species, which contribute to its survival in competitive environments. Its ecological significance lies in its role as a keystone species in rainforest ecosystems."
