    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoramosum, commonly known as the false yarrow or slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that attract various pollinators. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
