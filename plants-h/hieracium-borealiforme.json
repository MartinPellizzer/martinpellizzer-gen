    "intro": "Hieracium borealiforme, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems produce yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium borealiforme is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
