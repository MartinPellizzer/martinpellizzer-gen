    "intro": "Hieracium subarctoum, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats, often in alpine or tundra environments. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in cold, nutrient-poor soils. Hieracium subarctoum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife in its harsh native habitat."
