    "intro": "Heterogonium aspidioides, commonly known as the shield fern, is a rare and ancient species belonging to the family Heterogoniaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are typically covered in a dense layer of hair. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in dense forests. Its reproductive structures are unique, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
