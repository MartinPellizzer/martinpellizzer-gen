    "intro": "Hieracium protentum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium protentum is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
