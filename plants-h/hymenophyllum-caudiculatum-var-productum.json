    "intro": "Hymenophyllum caudiculatum var. productum, commonly known as the hairy maidenhair fern, is a terrestrial fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its rhizomes are short and thick, allowing it to anchor itself in nutrient-poor soils. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger fronds and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Hymenophyllum caudiculatum."
