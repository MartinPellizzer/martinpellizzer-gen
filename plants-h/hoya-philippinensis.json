    "intro": "Hoya philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Hoya philippinensis produces fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as moths and bees. It is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
