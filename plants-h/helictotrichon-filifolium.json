    "intro": "Helictotrichon filifolium, commonly known as silky bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as prairies and meadows. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, blue-green flowers. Silky bluegrass is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
