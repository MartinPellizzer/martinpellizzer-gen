    "intro": "Haworthia rossouwii var. rossouwii, commonly known as the Rossouw\u2019s Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with white or pink markings. The leaves are covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
