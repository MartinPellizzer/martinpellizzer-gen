    "intro": "Hieracium sublissodermum, commonly known as the velvet hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has hairy, rough leaves that give it a distinctive texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with a central disc. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
