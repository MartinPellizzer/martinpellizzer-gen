It is characterized by its large, showy flower clusters that can range in color from blue to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces bract-like flowers that are actually sterile, with true flowers located in the center. It thrives in partial shade and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. This variety is popular in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to change flower color with seasonal conditions."
