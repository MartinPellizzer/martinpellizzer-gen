    "intro": "Hibiscus pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf hibiscus, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to the southern United States. It typically grows to a height of only a few inches, featuring hairy, oval-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, bloom in late summer and early fall. Hibiscus pumilus thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens."
