    "intro": "Huarpea, commonly known as the \"flower of the Andes,\" is a striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Huarpea is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
