    "intro": "Habenaria papyracea, commonly known as the paper orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its flowers are often clustered in racemes and have a unique, slightly pungent aroma. The orchid's name derives from the papery texture of its petals, which are thin and translucent."
