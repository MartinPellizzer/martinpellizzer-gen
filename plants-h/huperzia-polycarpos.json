    "intro": "Huperzia polycarpos, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. It produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the undersides of its leaves. Huperzia polycarpos is a non-vascular plant that relies on water for the movement of nutrients and spore dispersal."
