    "intro": "Hosackia alamosana, commonly known as the Alamosan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as sandy soils and rocky slopes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hosackia alamosana plays a role in stabilizing soils and supporting local insect populations in its native habitat."
