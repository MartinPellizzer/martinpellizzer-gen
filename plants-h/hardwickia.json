    "intro": "Hardwickia, commonly known as the ironwood tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. The plants typically have compound leaves and produce small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Hardwickia species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. They often grow in dry, rocky soils and are well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
