    "intro": "Hippocratea cambodiana, commonly known as the Cambodian hippocratea, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia and parts of Vietnam. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humidity and partial light. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural habitat. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
