It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, rosette-like, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium aranoandurense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a food source for certain herbivores."
