    "intro": "Hieracium callistophyllum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium callistophyllum is often found in temperate climates and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
