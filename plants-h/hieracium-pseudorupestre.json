    "intro": "Hieracium pseudorupestre, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in cultivated areas."
