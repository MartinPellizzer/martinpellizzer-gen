    "intro": "Hieracium rupellense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Its flowers are arranged in a head composed of many small florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium rupellense is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can survive."
