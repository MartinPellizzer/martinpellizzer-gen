    "intro": "Helicandra, commonly known as the spiral palm, is a genus of flowering plants in the Arecaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of Africa, particularly the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. Helicandra species typically grow as shrubs or small trees with a single trunk and pinnate leaves. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are adapted to thrive in humid, shady environments."
