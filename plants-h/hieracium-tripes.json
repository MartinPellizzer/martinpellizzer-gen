    "intro": "Hieracium tripes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium tripes is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and flies."
