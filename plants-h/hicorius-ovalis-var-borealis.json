    "intro": "Hicorius ovalis var. borealis, commonly known as the northern oval hibiscus, is a variant of the hibiscus genus native to cold climates in the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its oval-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. It is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to gardens in cooler regions."
