    "intro": "Heliotropium californicum, commonly known as California heliotrope, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, blooming from spring to fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and grassland habitats. Its common name comes from the Greek words for \"sun-lover,\" reflecting its tendency to turn toward the sun."
