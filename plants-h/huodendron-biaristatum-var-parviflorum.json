    "intro": "Huodendron biaristatum var. parviflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered huodendron, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically elliptical and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, enhancing its ornamental appeal. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with cool climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in botanical conservation efforts."
