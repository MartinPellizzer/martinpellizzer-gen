    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. procerigenum, commonly known as the tall-eared hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant features upright stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, adorned with basal and alternate leaves that are hairy and often lobed. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. The species is characterized by its distinctive auriculate (ear-like) leaf bases, which give it its common name."
