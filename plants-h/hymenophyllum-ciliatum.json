    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, soft, and velvety fronds covered in fine, hairy structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum ciliatum is notable for its unique appearance and adaptation to humid, low-light conditions."
