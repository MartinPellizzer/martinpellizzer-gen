    "intro": "Hieracium pamphilii, commonly known as the Pamphilus hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium pamphilii is often found in association with other members of the hawkweed genus, and it can form dense colonies in suitable environments."
