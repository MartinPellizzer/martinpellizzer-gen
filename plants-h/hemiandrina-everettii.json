    "intro": "Hemiandrina everettii, commonly known as the Everett's hemiandrin, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink with prominent stamens. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hemiandrina everettii is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
