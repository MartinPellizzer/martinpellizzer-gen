    "intro": "Heuchera pulchella, commonly known as the silver queen heuchera, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its striking silver-white foliage that contrasts beautifully with its deep red or purple flower spikes. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers partial to full shade, making it ideal for woodland gardens. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps over time. Heuchera pulchella is valued for its ornamental foliage and is often used in shaded garden landscapes for its visual appeal."
