    "intro": "Huperzia haleakalae, commonly known as the Haleakal\u0101 fern, is a rare and endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Maui. It belongs to the family Hypnaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in montane rainforests. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is critically endangered and protected under conservation efforts. Its unique morphology and restricted range make it a significant subject of botanical study and conservation interest."
