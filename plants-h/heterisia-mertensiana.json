    "intro": "Heterisia mertensiana, commonly known as the desert bellflower, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form with small, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, which bloom during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
