    "intro": "Hedysarum cymbostegium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a robust root system that helps prevent soil erosion and fixes nitrogen, improving soil fertility. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated for forage and land stabilization."
