It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of flowers along the stem. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives on the forest floor or as an epiphyte. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and surrounding substrate. The flowers are usually small and fragrant, attracting pollinators such as bees and moths."
