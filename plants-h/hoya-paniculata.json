    "intro": "Hoya paniculata, commonly known as the wax plant or the prayer plant, is a tropical species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It is a climbing or trailing plant that can grow up to several meters in length, making it suitable for hanging baskets or trellises. Hoya paniculata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
