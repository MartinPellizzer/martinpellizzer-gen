    "intro": "Hieracium pectinigerum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium pectinigerum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
