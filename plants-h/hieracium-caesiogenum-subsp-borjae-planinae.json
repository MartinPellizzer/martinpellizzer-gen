It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
