    "intro": "Hordeum montanum, commonly known as mountain barley, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny grains. It is adapted to cold climates and can withstand harsh conditions such as strong winds and limited soil nutrients. Hordeum montanum plays a role in stabilizing soil in mountainous areas and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
