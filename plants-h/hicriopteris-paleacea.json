    "intro": "Hicriopteris paleacea, commonly known as the pale maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically light green with a pale underside. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori covered by a protective indusium. Hicriopteris paleacea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation."
