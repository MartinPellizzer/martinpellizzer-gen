    "intro": "Hieracium pseudatelodon, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble clusters of tiny flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium pseudatelodon is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
