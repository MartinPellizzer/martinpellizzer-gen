    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. magocsyanum, commonly known as the Magocsyan's hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
