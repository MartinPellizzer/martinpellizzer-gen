    "intro": "Hieracium brachyphyllum, commonly known as the short-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves and produces numerous yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and sandy soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Hieracium brachyphyllum is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
