    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ovatum, commonly known as the oval hymenophyllum, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, creeping rhizome and closely spaced, overlapping leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium."
