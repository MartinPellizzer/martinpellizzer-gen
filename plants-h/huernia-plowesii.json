    "intro": "Huernia plowesii, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its unique, ribbed stems and tubular, waxy leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often blooming in late winter or early spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to flourish. Due to its drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes."
