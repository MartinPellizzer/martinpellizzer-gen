    "intro": "Heliconia longiflora subsp. ecuadoriensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the humid lowland forests of Ecuador. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves used to attract pollinators. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are enclosed within the vibrant bracts. It thrives in warm, moist environments and is often found in secondary growth areas and along riverbanks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for birds and insects."
