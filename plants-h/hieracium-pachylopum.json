It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features upright stems with broad, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium pachylopum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
