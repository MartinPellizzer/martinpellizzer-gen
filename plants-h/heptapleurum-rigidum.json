    "intro": "Heptapleurum rigidum, commonly known as the rigid heptapleurum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Actinidiaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Heptapleurum rigidum is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and hardy nature."
