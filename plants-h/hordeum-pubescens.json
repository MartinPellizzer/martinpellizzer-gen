    "intro": "Hordeum pubescens, commonly known as hairy barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the presence of short, stiff hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three florets. Its seeds are typically small and oval, with a hard outer covering. Hordeum pubescens is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural fields."
