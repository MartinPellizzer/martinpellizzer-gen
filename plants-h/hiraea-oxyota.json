    "intro": "Hiraea oxyota, commonly known as the narrowleaf hiraea, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
