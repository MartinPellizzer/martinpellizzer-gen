It typically grows up to 30 cm tall, with slender stems that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams."
