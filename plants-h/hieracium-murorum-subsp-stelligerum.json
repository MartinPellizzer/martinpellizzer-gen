    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. stelligerum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flower heads, which are typically composed of numerous small disc florets. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often growing in open, sunny habitats near the shoreline. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. This subspecies is adapted to withstand coastal winds and salt spray, making it a resilient member of coastal plant communities."
