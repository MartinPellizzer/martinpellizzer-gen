It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive appearance, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium limbigerum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
