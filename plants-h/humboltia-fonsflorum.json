It is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that resemble cascading waterfalls, hence its common name. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and full sun exposure, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, while its flowers range in color from white to pale blue. Humboltia fonsflorum is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local pollinators."
