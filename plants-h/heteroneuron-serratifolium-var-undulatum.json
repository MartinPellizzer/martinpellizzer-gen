    "intro": "Heteroneuron serratifolium var. undulatum, commonly known as the wavy-leaved heteroneuron, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, serrated, wavy-edged leaves that vary in shape and size depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories and is often found near streams or in humid valleys. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
