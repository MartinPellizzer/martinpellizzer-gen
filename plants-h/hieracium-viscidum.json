    "intro": "Hieracium viscidum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its sticky, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive texture. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium viscidum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
