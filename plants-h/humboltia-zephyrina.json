    "intro": "Humboltia zephyrina, commonly known as the skyrocket, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a member of the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its slender, ascending stems that can grow up to 10 feet tall. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-tolerant nature. Humboltia zephyrina is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in arid environments."
