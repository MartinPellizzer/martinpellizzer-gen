    "intro": "Hieracium trichanthodium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, hairy achenes as its seeds. Hieracium trichanthodium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
