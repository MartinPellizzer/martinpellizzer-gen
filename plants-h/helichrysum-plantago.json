    "intro": "Helichrysum plantago, commonly known as the golden groundsel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helichrysum plantago is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties."
