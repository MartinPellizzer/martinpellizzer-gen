    "intro": "Hypoxis kilimanjarica, commonly known as the Kilimanjaro yellowstar, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa. It belongs to the family Asparagaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a star-like formation. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cool, temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
