It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough textures, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
