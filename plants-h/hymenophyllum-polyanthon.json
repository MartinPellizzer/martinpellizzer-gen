    "intro": "Hymenophyllum polyanthon, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes, which give it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum polyanthon is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
