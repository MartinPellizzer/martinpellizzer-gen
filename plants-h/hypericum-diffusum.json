    "intro": "Hypericum diffusum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features sprawling stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly along the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum diffusum is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and gravelly soils."
