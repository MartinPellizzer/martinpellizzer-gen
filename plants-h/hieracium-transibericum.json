It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium transibericum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in harsh, high-latitude environments."
