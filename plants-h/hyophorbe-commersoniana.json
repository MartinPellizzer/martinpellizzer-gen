    "intro": "Hyophorbe commersoniana, commonly known as the Commerson's poinsettia, is a flowering plant native to the Comoros Islands in the Indian Ocean. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thick, waxy leaves that are often green with a reddish or purple tinge on the underside. The plant produces striking, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves, surrounding small, inconspicuous true flowers. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant foliage and seasonal color changes. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate dry conditions once established."
