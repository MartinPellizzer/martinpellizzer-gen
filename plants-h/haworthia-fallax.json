    "intro": "Haworthia fallax, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is known for its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. Haworthia fallax thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot."
