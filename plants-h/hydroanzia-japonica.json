    "intro": "Hydroanzia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to East Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and marshes, where it forms dense, floating mats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are adapted for efficient water absorption and photosynthesis. Its rhizomes anchor it to submerged surfaces, while its leaves remain buoyant on the water's surface. Hydroanzia japonica plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
