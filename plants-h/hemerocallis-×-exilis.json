    "intro": "Hemerocallis \u00d7 exilis, commonly known as the dwarf daylily, is a compact perennial plant native to China. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant blooms in early summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its low-growing habit. Hemerocallis \u00d7 exilis is relatively easy to grow, requiring well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade."
