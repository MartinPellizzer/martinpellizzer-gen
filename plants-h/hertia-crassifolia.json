    "intro": "Hertia crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hertia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features rosettes of broad, fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue or purple flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a favored plant among gardeners in Mediterranean climates."
