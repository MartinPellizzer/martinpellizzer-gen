It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowering heads and hairy, often glandular leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. The subspecies myriothrichum is distinguished by its finely hairy stems and leaves, contributing to its unique botanical appearance."
