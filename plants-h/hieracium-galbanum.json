It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellowish-orange flower heads consist of numerous small florets, and it produces a milky sap that can be toxic to some animals. The plant is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
