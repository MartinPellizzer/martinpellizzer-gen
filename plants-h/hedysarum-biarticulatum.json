    "intro": "Hedysarum biarticulatum, commonly known as the two-jointed vetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family Fabaceae. It is native to regions of Europe and western Asia, often found in dry, rocky habitats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets. Hedysarum biarticulatum is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects. Its seeds are typically dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable environments."
