It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy structures. The plant is distinguished by its reduced foliage, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often sparse and clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it faces significant conservation challenges."
