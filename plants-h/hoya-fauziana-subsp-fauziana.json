    "intro": "Hoya fauziana subsp. fauziana, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, thick leaves and clusters of small, coral-pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is a trailing vine with a rapid growth rate, making it popular for hanging baskets or trained on trellises. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya fauziana subsp. fauziana is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
