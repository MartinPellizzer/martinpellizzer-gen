    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. tenebrescens, commonly known as the dark-hued hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and northern Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or reddish hues. Its flowers are yellow and borne in clusters, with petals that are usually narrower than those of other hawkweed species. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker foliage and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
