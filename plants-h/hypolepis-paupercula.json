    "intro": "Hypolepis paupercula, commonly known as the poor fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with short, horizontal stems that produce both roots and new shoots. Its spores are released from sori that are located on the undersides of the fronds, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Hypolepis paupercula make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical climates."
