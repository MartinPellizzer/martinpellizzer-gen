    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. obscurum, commonly known as the dark sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded, silver-green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
