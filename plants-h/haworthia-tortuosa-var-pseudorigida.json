    "intro": "Haworthia tortuosa var. pseudorigida, commonly known as the spiral haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically bluish-green with white or yellowish markings. The leaves are often twisted or spiraled, giving the plant its distinctive appearance. It produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
