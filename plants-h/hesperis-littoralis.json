    "intro": "Hesperis littoralis, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines, thriving in salty and windy environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with a fine layer of hair to reduce water loss. Hesperis littoralis is an important plant for coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
