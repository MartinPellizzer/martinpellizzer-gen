It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium scopolioides is often found in open habitats and can be an indicator of nutrient-poor soils."
