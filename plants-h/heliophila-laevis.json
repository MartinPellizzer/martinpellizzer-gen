    "intro": "Heliophila laevis, commonly known as the smooth heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, white or pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in environments with full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and smooth, often floating on the water surface, while its roots help stabilize the soil. Heliophila laevis is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to improve water quality and provide habitat for aquatic life."
