    "intro": "Hemionitis lozanoi, commonly known as the Zambian fern, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Zambia. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across water surfaces and form dense mats. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often submerged, with some floating leaves that have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is adapted to low-light conditions. Due to its specialized morphology, it plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
