    "intro": "Henryastrum augustinianum, commonly known as the golden water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom above the water, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its roots anchor it in the muddy substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense mats. Henryastrum augustinianum is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in maintaining water quality and biodiversity."
