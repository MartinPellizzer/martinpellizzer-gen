The plant features succulent, silver-gray leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, providing a distinctive visual appearance. Its small, pinkish-white flowers are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes, which bloom during the spring and summer months. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
