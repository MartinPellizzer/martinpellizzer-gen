    "intro": "Heteropterys pauciflora f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-flowered heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to tropical regions of South America. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, clustered flowers that are often covered in glandular hairs. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The glandular structures on the leaves and stems are a distinguishing feature, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. It is often found in moist, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests."
