    "intro": "Hemionitis quadripinnata, commonly known as the four-pinnate water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It has delicate, floating leaves that are divided into four pairs of pinnate lobes, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Hemionitis quadripinnata is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as an indicator of water quality."
