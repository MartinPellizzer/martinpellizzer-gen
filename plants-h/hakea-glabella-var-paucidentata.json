    "intro": "Hakea glabella var. paucidentata, commonly known as the smooth hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and small, waxy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. The species is also notable for its ability to attract nectar-feeding birds and insects."
