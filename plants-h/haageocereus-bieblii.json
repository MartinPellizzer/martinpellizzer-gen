It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. It is well adapted to hot, dry climates and requires minimal water once established. Its botanical features make it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens and a fascinating subject for botanical study."
