    "intro": "Hieracium pseudexilentum, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its shorter stems and smaller leaves."
