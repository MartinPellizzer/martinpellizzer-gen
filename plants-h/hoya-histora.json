    "intro": "Hoya histora, commonly known as the \"Beggar's Treasure,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya histora is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
