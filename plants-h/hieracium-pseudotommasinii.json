    "intro": "Hieracium pseudotommasinii, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a weed in some regions due to its invasive potential."
