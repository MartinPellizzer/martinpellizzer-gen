    "intro": "Hieracium pseuderiopus, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
