    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina subsp. orthantha, commonly known as alpine hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in width. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its low-growing habit and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions, it plays a significant role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude ecosystems."
