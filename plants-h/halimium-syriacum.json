    "intro": "Halimium syriacum, commonly known as Syrian rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, yellow or orange flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Halimium syriacum is adapted to grow in well-drained soils and is often found in limestone or rocky habitats."
