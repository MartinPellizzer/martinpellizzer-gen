    "intro": "Helvingia, commonly known as the yellow water lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nympheaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in the mud, while its stems are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Helvingia plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
