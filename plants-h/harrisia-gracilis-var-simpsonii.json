    "intro": "Harrisia gracilis var. simpsonii, commonly known as Simpson's slender harrisia, is a species of cactus native to southern Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in small, white spines and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils in dry, sunny environments. It is a low-maintenance plant that thrives in well-drained conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
