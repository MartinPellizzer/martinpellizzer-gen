    "intro": "Halenia caleoides, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and showy, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to its habitat specificity, Halenia caleoides is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
