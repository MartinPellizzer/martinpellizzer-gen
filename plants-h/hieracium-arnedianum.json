    "intro": "Hieracium arnedianum, commonly known as the Armenian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often found in meadows, rocky slopes, and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
