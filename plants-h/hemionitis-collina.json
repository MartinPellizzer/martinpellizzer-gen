    "intro": "Hemionitis collina, commonly known as the mountain hemionitis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often in areas with high elevations and cool climates. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, and it is known for its ability to survive in harsh, arid conditions. Hemionitis collina is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
