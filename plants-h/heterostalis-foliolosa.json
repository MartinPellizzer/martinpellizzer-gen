    "intro": "Heterostalis foliolosa, commonly known as the leafy mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of host trees, primarily in the genus *Ficus*. It lacks true roots and absorbs water and nutrients through its stems and leaves, which are adapted for this parasitic lifestyle. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often pollinated by insects, leading to the formation of berries that are dispersed by animals. Its leaves are alternate and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. Heterostalis foliolosa is found in the understory of dense forests, where it thrives in humid, shaded conditions."
