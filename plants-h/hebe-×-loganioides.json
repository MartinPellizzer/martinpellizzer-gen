    "intro": "Hebe \u00d7 loganioides, commonly known as the silver fern, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Hebe and a species of loganioides. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, dark green leaves with a silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, which bloom in spring and summer. It is native to New Zealand and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The silver fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate a range of environmental conditions."
