    "intro": "Hieracium squalidum subsp. prinzii, commonly known as the Prinz's ragged robin, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its often arid or disturbed habitats. This subspecies is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can thrive with minimal competition. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare member of the Hieracium genus."
