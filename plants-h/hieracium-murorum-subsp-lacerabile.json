    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. lacerabile, commonly known as the ragged hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, with a distinctive yellow flower head composed of numerous small florets. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its rapid spread through vegetative reproduction. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
