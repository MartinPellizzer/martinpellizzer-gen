    "intro": "Hymenophyllum halconeuse, commonly known as the silver hair-fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum halconeuse is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
