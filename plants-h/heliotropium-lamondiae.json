    "intro": "Heliotropium lamondiae, commonly known as the Lamond's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the cooler months. The plant has hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it adapt to its high-altitude environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
