It features a mat-forming growth habit with slender, hairy stems that spread along the ground. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along riverbanks."
