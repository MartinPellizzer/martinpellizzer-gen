    "intro": "Habenaria nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Himalayan region. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, slender stem and linear leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
