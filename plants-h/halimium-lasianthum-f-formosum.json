It features dense clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
