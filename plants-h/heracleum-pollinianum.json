    "intro": "Heracleum pollinianum, commonly known as the Italian cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant features large, compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in height, with a distinctive umbel of white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs and have a mild, aromatic scent. The roots are thick and fleshy, though they are not typically consumed due to their potential toxicity."
