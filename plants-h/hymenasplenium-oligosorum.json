    "intro": "Hymenasplenium oligosorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically divided into small, linear segments. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in groups called sori. Hymenasplenium oligosorum is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and is often found in shaded, moist environments. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and relatively rare member of the fern family."
