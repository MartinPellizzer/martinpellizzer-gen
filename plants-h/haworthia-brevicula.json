    "intro": "Haworthia brevicula, commonly known as the dwarf Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically pale green with white or translucent markings. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It prefers well-draining soil and bright, indirect light, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for succulent enthusiasts."
