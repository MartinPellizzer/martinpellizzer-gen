It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a rosette of basal leaves and produces numerous flowering stems with clustered yellow flowers. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other hieracium species."
