    "intro": "Hieracium adspersum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium adspersum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
