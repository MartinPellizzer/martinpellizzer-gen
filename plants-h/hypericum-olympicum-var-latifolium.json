    "intro": "Hypericum olympicum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features upright, woody stems that bear opposite, oval to elliptic leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in summer, which are surrounded by four to five small, leaf-like bracts. Its foliage is often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in herbal medicine, though its medicinal uses are less well-documented compared to the common St. John's wort."
