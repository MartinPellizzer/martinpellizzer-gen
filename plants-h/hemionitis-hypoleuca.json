    "intro": "Hemionitis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white hemionite, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-white fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in rocky crevices or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
