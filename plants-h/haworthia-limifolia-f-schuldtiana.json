    "intro": "Haworthia limifolia f. schuldtiana, commonly known as the Schuldt's narrow-leaf Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color with white or pale green markings. The plant produces small, white flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
