    "intro": "Hedeoma glabra, commonly known as smooth hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Hedeoma glabra is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its smooth, hairless stems and leaves contribute to its common name and distinguish it from similar species."
