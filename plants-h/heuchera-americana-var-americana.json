    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. americana, commonly known as the American alumroot, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its clump-forming growth habit and vibrant, colorful foliage that ranges from green to red, purple, and gold. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in clusters during the spring, typically in shades of white or pale pink. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to provide seasonal interest throughout the growing season."
