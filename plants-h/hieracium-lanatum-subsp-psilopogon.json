    "intro": "Hieracium lanatum subsp. psilopogon, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features pale yellow to orange composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, often with a bluish-green hue, and the stems are covered in fine, white hairs. The species is characterized by its reduced leaf hairs and shorter flowering stems compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
