    "intro": "Helianthus nuttallii var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow ray florets that surround a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture and often have a bluish-gray hue. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
