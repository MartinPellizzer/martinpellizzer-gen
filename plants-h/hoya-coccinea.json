    "intro": "Hoya coccinea, commonly known as the red-veined hoya, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves with prominent red veins, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. Hoya coccinea is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
