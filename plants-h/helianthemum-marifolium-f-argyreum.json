    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium f. argyreum, commonly known as the silverleaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss, an adaptation to its arid environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a bright touch to rocky or sandy soils. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety 'argyreum' is distinguished by its particularly dense and reflective leaf covering, enhancing its ornamental value."
