    "intro": "Hypericum hircinum subsp. cambessedesii, commonly known as the Corsican St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers, which bloom in summer, and its upright, compact growth habit. The plant has small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. This subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different morphology compared to the more widespread H. hircinum."
