    "intro": "Helichrysum fulgens, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, tubular florets that are clustered in dense, spherical heads. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum fulgens is also valued for its ornamental use and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
