    "intro": "Heteromma simplicifolia, commonly known as the simple-leaved heteromma, is a species of flowering plant native to arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its simple, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, typically blooming in late spring. It is adapted to survive in dry environments with deep root systems and thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapic gardens."
