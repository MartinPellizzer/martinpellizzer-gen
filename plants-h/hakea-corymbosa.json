    "intro": "Hakea corymbosa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, cylindrical or conical flower spikes. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Hakea corymbosa is often found in coastal heathlands and is well-suited to sandy or well-drained soils."
