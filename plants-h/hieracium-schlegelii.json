    "intro": "Hieracium schlegelii, commonly known as Schlegel's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal and rosette-forming, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that give it a daisy-like appearance. Schlegel's hawkweed is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
