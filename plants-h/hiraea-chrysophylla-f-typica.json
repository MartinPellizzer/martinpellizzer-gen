    "intro": "Hiraea chrysophylla f. typica, commonly known as the golden-leaf hiraea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow foliage, which is a result of its unique chlorophyll composition. The plant produces small, delicate white flowers that bloom in late spring, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth rate, it is considered a conservation concern."
