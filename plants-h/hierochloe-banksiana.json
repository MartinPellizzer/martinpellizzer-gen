    "intro": "Hierochloe banksiana, commonly known as the Banks' bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of lakes and rivers. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled at the edges, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Hierochloe banksiana plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
