    "intro": "Hasseltia, commonly known as the African snowbush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in rocky and arid environments. The plants are characterized by their succulent leaves and vibrant, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. Hasseltia species are often used in rock gardens due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value. They play an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
