    "intro": "Hymenophyllum acanthoides, commonly known as the acanthoid fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy fronds and is typically found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a unique reproductive structure called a synangium, which is a type of spore-producing organ. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a dense covering of fine hairs that help retain moisture. Hymenophyllum acanthoides is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures."
