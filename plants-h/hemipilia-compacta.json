    "intro": "Hemipilia compacta, commonly known as the compact lady's tresses, is a flowering plant belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including China, India, and Indonesia. The plant produces dense clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form compact, low-growing mats. Hemipilia compacta is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands."
