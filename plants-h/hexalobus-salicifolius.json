It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of willow species. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists studying tropical flora."
