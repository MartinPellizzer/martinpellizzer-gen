    "intro": "Huperzia rupicola, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and is typically found growing on rocky outcrops or in shaded, moist environments. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia rupicola is well adapted to rocky habitats, often thriving in areas with poor soil conditions. Its unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
