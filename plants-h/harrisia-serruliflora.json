    "intro": "Harrisia serruliflora, commonly known as the serrated-flowered harrisia, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soil. Its leaves are usually reduced to spines, and it produces small, edible fruits that are sometimes used in local cuisine. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
