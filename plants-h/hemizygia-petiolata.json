    "intro": "Hemizygia petiolata, commonly known as the white-flowered sandverbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, four-lobed fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. Hemizygia petiolata is also noted for its ecological importance, providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
