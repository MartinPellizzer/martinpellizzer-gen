    "intro": "Hymenophyllum molle, commonly known as the soft shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, silky coating. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a unique, shield-like cover. Hymenophyllum molle is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
