    "intro": "Hebea nemorosa, commonly known as the forest hebe, is a perennial plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Hebea nemorosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with partial shade."
