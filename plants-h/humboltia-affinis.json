    "intro": "Humboltia affinis, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a climbing plant native to Central America and parts of South America. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its large, showy white flowers that open at night. The plant produces violet-colored berries that contain toxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to animals and humans. Humboltia affinis thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as forest edges and abandoned fields. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit and ornamental value make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and horticulture."
