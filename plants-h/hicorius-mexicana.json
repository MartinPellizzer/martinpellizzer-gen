    "intro": "Hicorius mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican thistle, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its spiny, erect stems and small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has silver-gray foliage that helps it retain moisture in its dry environment. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Hicorius mexicana plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
