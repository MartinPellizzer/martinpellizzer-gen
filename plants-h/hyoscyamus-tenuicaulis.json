    "intro": "Hyoscyamus tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender belladonna, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of the Middle East. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and purple or violet flowers. The plant produces small, yellowish fruits that contain toxic seeds, making it a hazardous species to handle. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers are typically clustered in loose inflorescences. Due to its toxic properties, it is not commonly cultivated for ornamental or agricultural purposes."
