    "intro": "Hedysarum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, round pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum glomeratum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
