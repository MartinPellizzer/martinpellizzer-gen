    "intro": "Hebe lapidosa, commonly known as the stone hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage that is often covered in a fine, powdery coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Hebe lapidosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in temperate climates."
