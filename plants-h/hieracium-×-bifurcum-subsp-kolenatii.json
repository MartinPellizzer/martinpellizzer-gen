    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. kolenatii, commonly known as the Kolenatii hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has hairy, often reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires careful management."
