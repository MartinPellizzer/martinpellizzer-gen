    "intro": "Hedera helix var. canariensis, commonly known as the Canary Island ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that originates from the Canary Islands. It is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries, which are attractive to birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it requires careful management to prevent ecological disruption."
