    "intro": "Hanguana bogneri, commonly known as the Bogner's hanguana, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and opposite, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, arranged in terminal inflorescences. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
