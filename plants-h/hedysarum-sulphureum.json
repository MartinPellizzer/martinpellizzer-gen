    "intro": "Hedysarum sulphureum, commonly known as golden peavine, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume characterized by its trailing growth habit and yellow-orange flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny areas such as grasslands and disturbed sites. Hedysarum sulphureum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
