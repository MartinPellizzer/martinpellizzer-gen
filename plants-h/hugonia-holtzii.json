    "intro": "Hugonia holtzii, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh grass, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than an inch wide, with a smooth, dark green surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in loose clusters at the tips of its stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist soils. Hugonia holtzii is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems."
