    "intro": "Hymenopappus nudipes var. alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, reducing water loss in arid conditions. This variant is adapted to rocky, alpine soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters."
