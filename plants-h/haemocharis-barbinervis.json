    "intro": "Haemocharis barbinervis, commonly known as the golden torch ginger, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright yellow bracts that resemble a torch, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil. Haemocharis barbinervis is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant and showy appearance."
