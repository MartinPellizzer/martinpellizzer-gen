    "intro": "Hudsonia australis, commonly known as the coastal sand verbena, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal climates with high salinity and strong winds. The plant features small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hairs that help reduce water loss. Hudsonia australis is an important plant for stabilizing dunes and supporting local wildlife in its native habitat."
