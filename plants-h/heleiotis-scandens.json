    "intro": "Heleiotis scandens, commonly known as the climbing morning glory, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its vining growth habit and heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, often opening in the early morning. Heleiotis scandens thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found climbing over shrubs or trees in its native habitat. Its rapid growth and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
