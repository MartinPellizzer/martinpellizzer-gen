    "intro": "Hesperis hamzaoglui, commonly known as Hamzaoglu's honesty, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble those of the common honesty (Hesperis matronalis). The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and is native to specific regions in Turkey. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing a delicate, fragrant floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
