    "intro": "Hydrolea prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate hydrolea, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features slender, sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy surface. Hydrolea prostrata is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in dry conditions."
