    "intro": "Hieracium martrini, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium martrini is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
