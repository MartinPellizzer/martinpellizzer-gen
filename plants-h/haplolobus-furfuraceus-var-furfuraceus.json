    "intro": "Haplolobus furfuraceus var. furfuraceus, commonly known as the hairy ant plant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and the presence of specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for mutualistic ants. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
