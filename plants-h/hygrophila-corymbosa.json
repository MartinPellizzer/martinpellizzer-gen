It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of white or pale blue flowers, which bloom throughout the growing season. Hygrophila corymbosa thrives in moist or aquatic environments, making it a common sight in marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. It is often used in ornamental gardening and traditional medicine due to its attractive appearance and potential therapeutic properties."
