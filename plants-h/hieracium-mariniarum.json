    "intro": "Hieracium mariniarum, commonly known as sea hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along shorelines, where it tolerates saline and windy conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to reddish-brown. Hieracium mariniarum plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
