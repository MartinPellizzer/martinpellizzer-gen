    "intro": "Hereroa hesperantha, commonly known as the Cape snowbush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and clusters of white or pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, making it drought-tolerant. Hereroa hesperantha is often used in rock gardens and as a landscape plant due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
