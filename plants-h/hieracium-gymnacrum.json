    "intro": "Hieracium gymnacrum, commonly known as the lesser spearthorn, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It has spiny, glandular leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium gymnacrum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
