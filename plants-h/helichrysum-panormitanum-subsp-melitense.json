    "intro": "Helichrysum panormitanum subsp. melitense, commonly known as the Maltese everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Malta and surrounding areas. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces dense clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers that are highly resistant to drying, giving it a lifelike appearance when dried. The plant features silver-green, aromatic foliage with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its resilience and ornamental value have contributed to its cultivation in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
