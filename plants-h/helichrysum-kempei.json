    "intro": "Helichrysum kempei, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often mistaken for true flowers, as they are actually composite inflorescences. Its foliage is covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Helichrysum kempei is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
