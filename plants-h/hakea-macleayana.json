    "intro": "Hakea macleayana, commonly known as the Macleay's hakea, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-club shaped woody stems and its striking, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces woody, cone-like seed pods that open to release its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and dry inland areas. Hakea macleayana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
