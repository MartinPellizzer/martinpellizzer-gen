    "intro": "Hirania, commonly known as the \"sea hibiscus,\" is a flowering plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is native to coastal regions of the Americas, particularly in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features showy, hibiscus-like flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hirania thrives in sandy or saline soils and is often found growing near the shoreline or in coastal dunes."
