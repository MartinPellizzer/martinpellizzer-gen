    "intro": "Heterocentron roseum, commonly known as the pink-flowered water lily, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features showy, rose-pink flowers that bloom on long, slender stalks above the water surface. The leaves are broad, rounded, and float on the water's surface, providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female parts, and are pollinated by insects. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments with ample sunlight."
