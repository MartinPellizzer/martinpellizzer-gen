    "intro": "Hierochloe latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually covered with fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Hierochloe latifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland environments."
