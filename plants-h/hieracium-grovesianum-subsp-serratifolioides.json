    "intro": "Hieracium grovesianum subsp. serratifolioides, commonly known as the serrated-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features upright stems that bear basal and alternate leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and serrated along the edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as stream margins and forest clearings. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its native environment, with hairy foliage that may help reduce water loss."
