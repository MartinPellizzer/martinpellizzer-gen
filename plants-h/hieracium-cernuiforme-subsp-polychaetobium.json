    "intro": "Hieracium cernuiforme subsp. polychaetobium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features a low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in clusters, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, contributing to its common name."
