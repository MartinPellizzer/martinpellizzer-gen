    "intro": "Hemionitis timorensis, commonly known as the Timor spleenwort, is a rare and delicate fern native to the island of Timor. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered growth habit and finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are positioned on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis timorensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
