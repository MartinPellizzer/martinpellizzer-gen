    "intro": "Hiptage detergens, commonly known as the sooty hiptage, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often clustered in terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a rough texture and a distinctive sooty appearance due to the presence of fine hairs. Hiptage detergens is often found in moist, shaded areas and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
