    "intro": "Hymenocallis proterantha, commonly known as the early morning glory, is a striking tropical plant native to Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale yellow flowers that open in the early morning and close by midday. The plant produces a bulbous corm as its underground storage organ, which helps it survive dry periods. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy texture that aids in water retention. Hymenocallis proterantha is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family."
