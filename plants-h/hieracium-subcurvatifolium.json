    "intro": "Hieracium subcurvatifolium, commonly known as the bent-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are distinctive for their curved shape and rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. It is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
