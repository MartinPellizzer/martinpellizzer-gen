    "intro": "Hieracium semiseptentrionale, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
