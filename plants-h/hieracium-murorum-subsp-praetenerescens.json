    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. praetenerescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in moist, often shaded environments such as meadows, woodland edges, and riverbanks. The plant features upright, hairy stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, hairy achenes as its seeds. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
