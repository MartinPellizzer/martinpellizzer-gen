    "intro": "Hydrocotyle langsdorffii, commonly known as the swamp spurge or water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a rosette of rounded, succulent leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist to aquatic habitats, including marshes, ponds, and along stream banks. Hydrocotyle langsdorffii is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and improve water quality."
