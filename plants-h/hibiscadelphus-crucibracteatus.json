    "intro": "Hibiscadelphus crucibracteatus, commonly known as the Kauai waterwheel, is a rare endemic species found only on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its distinctive, showy yellow flowers with five broad, overlapping petals. The plant has palmate leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically in rainforest environments. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to survive."
