    "intro": "Hieracium violaceipes, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its purple flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium violaceipes is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
