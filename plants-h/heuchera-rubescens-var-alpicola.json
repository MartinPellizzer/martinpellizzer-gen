    "intro": "Heuchera rubescens var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine heuchera, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of North America. It features dense, compact foliage that is typically a vibrant red or bronze color, with heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers well-drained, moist soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This variety is particularly valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cooler, high-altitude environments."
