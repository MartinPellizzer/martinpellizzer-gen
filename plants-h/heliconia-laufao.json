It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, inconspicuous true flowers surrounded by fleshy, lobster-claw-shaped bracts. Its leaves are long, broad, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Heliconia laufao is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
