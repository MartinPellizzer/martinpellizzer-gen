    "intro": "Hellerorchis doeringii, commonly known as the Doering's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors, where it thrives in the dappled light of the forest canopy. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single spike of flowers that are often overlooked due to their modest appearance. Due to habitat loss and its limited distribution, Hellerorchis doeringii is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
