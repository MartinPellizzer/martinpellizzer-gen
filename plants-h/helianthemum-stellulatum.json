    "intro": "Helianthemum stellulatum, commonly known as the starry rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy species suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
