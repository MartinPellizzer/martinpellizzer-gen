    "intro": "Habenaria pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It prefers moist, shaded habitats and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
