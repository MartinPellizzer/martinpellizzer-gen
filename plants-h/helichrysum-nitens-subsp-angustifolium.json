    "intro": "Helichrysum nitens subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and dense clusters of yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and the plant is drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant's ability to retain its color after drying makes it a valued component in floral arrangements."
