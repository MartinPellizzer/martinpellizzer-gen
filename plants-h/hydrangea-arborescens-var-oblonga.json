    "intro": "Hydrangea arborescens var. oblonga, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, rounded clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces showy, lacecap flower heads that are typically white with a central cluster of smaller, sterile flowers. Its leaves are ovate to oblong in shape, hence the variety name, and are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. This hydrangea thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
