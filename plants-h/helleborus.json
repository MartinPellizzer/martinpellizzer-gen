    "intro": "Helleborus, commonly known as the Christmas rose or marsh hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. These plants are characterized by their evergreen basal leaves and showy, often long-lasting flowers that bloom in winter or early spring. Helleborus species are native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, often growing in woodland or shady areas. The flowers typically have petals that are waxy and come in shades of white, purple, and pink. They are also known for their toxic properties, containing cardiac glycosides that can be harmful to humans and animals."
