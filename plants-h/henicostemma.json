    "intro": "Henicostemma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved marsh herb, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged oppositely. The flowers are usually pink or purple, with two lips, and are clustered in dense inflorescences. These plants are typically found in wet or moist habitats, such as marshes and stream banks. They play a role in supporting local insect populations and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
