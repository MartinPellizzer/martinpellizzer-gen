    "intro": "Heterolaena incana, commonly known as the silverleaf bush, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which results from dense covering of fine, white hairs on the leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its leaves are usually elliptical or ovate in shape and have a leathery texture. Heterolaena incana is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
