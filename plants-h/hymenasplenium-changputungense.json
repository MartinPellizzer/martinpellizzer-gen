    "intro": "Hymenasplenium changputungense, commonly known as the Changpu tung spleenwort, is a rare and lesser-known fern species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that typically grow in shaded, moist environments. The plant's leaves are usually divided into narrow, linear segments, and it exhibits a unique reproductive structure with sporangia arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range. Botanists study this plant to better understand its ecological role and conservation needs in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."
