    "intro": "Huntleya brevis, commonly known as the broad-leaved huntleya, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in coastal and sandy environments. The plant features broad, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of yellow or orange, and bloom during the warmer months. Huntleya brevis is known for its resilience and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
