    "intro": "Habenaria tenuispica var. eggelingii, commonly known as the slender-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and swamps. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, which is essential for its survival. This variety is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in moist forest understories."
