    "intro": "Heterolamium debile var. debile, commonly known as the slender heterolamium, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to certain regions of South America. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves arranged in a basal rosette, which help it conserve moisture in arid environments. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters during the warmer months. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species."
