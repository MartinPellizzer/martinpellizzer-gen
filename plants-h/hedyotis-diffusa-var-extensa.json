    "intro": "Hedyotis diffusa var. extensa, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats over the soil. The plant produces small, white or greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate, and often have a slightly toothed margin. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
