    "intro": "Habenaria marquisensis subsp. marquisensis, commonly known as the Marquesan marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Society Islands in French Polynesia. It typically grows in wet, forested areas and is characterized by its slender, erect stem and showy, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the moist soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
