    "intro": "Hieraciodes flexuosa, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, sprawling habit with small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the spring, which are borne on slender, hairy stems. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Hieraciodes flexuosa is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the ecological diversity of these high-elevation environments."
