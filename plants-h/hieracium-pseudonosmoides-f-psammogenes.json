The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically narrow and linear, adapted to withstand harsh, windy conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
