    "intro": "Hosta sieboldii var. rectifolia, commonly known as the straight-leaf siebold hosta, is a hybrid plant resulting from crosses between Hosta sieboldii and Hosta ventricosa. It is characterized by its broad, waxy, dark green leaves that are relatively straight and upright, distinguishing it from other hosta varieties. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches, with a spread of about 24 to 30 inches, making it suitable for shade gardens. It produces small, fragrant white flowers on tall, slender stems in late summer. This variety is prized for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to moist, well-drained soil in partially shaded environments."
