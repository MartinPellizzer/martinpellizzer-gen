    "intro": "Helianthus divaricatus var. scaberrimus, commonly known as the rough sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an attractive addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
