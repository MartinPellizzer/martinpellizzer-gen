    "intro": "Hymenanthera chathamica, commonly known as the Chatham Island whitebeam, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Chatham Islands of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or rocky habitats, showing a high degree of adaptation to the harsh maritime environment. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, dark berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Hymenanthera chathamica is also notable for its slow growth rate and limited distribution, making it a rare and ecologically significant species."
