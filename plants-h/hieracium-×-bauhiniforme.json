    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bauhiniforme, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium piloselloides and Hieracium aurantiacum, leading to a variety of morphological characteristics. The plant typically has dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow or orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a range of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
