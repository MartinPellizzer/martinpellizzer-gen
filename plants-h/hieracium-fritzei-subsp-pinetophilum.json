    "intro": "Hieracium fritzei subsp. pinetophilum, commonly known as the pine forest hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the pine forests of the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a serrated edge, while the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. This subspecies is often found in association with other pine forest flora and is adapted to the specific microclimate of its habitat."
