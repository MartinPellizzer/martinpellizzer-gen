    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. farinosum, commonly known as the sticky rockrose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a similar sticky coating. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
