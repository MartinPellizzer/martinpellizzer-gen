    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. tibetanum, commonly known as Tibetan barley, is a variant of the common barley species native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It is a hardy, annual grass that thrives in cold climates and poor soils, often found at elevations above 3,000 meters. The plant produces small, oval-shaped grains that are typically light golden in color and are used in traditional Tibetan cuisine and brewing. Its growth cycle is adapted to the short growing seasons of its native environment, with rapid maturation to avoid frost. Tibetan barley is also valued for its nutritional content and has been used in local agriculture for centuries."
