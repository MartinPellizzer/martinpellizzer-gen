    "intro": "Hemionitis mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis mexicana is considered a species of conservation concern."
