    "intro": "Hakea obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Hakea obliqua is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or sandy soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
