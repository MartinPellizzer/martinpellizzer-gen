    "intro": "Hemicicca, commonly known as the desert holly, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Portulacaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas, particularly in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants are typically low-growing shrubs with fleshy, often spiny stems and small, clustered leaves. Hemicicca species are adapted to harsh desert conditions, featuring succulent structures that store water. They produce small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a touch of color to the otherwise stark desert landscape."
