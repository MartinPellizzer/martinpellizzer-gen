    "intro": "Helianthemum abelardoi, commonly known as the Abelard's rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves adapted to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom in spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
