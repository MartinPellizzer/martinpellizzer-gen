    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum var. angustifolium, commonly known as narrowleaf barley, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, narrow leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide, giving it its distinguishing appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, which are characteristic of the grass family Poaceae. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wet meadows or along stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
