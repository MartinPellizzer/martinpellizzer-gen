    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hydrocotyle batrashioides, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, greenish-white flowers bloom in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain seeds. Hydrocotyle batrachioides plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water quality through oxygenation."
