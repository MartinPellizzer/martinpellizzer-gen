    "intro": "Hydrocotyle villosa var. latifolia, commonly known as broadleaf marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, broad leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic life."
