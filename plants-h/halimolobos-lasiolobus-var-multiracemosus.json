    "intro": "Halimolobos lasiolobus var. multiracemosus, commonly known as the hairy-leaved halimolobos, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that are often pubescent and have a distinct, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences, which bloom in the spring. Its woody stems are typically covered in a thick layer of fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. This species is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
