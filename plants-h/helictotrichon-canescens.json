    "intro": "Helictotrichon canescens, commonly known as silverhair grass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, silver-gray stems and fine, hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Helictotrichon canescens is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soils and its adaptability to various environmental conditions."
