    "intro": "Hecaste juncea, commonly known as slender flax, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hecaste juncea is often found in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It is valued for its fibrous stalks, which have been historically used for textile production."
