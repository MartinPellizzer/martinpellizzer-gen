    "intro": "Heliconia reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are used to attract pollinators. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are typically visited by hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and glossy, often with a net-like vein pattern that gives it its common name. Heliconia reticulata is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking appearance and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
