    "intro": "Helichrysum subluteum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that remain relatively unchanged after flowering, giving it a lifelike appearance. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum subluteum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is often used in traditional medicine."
