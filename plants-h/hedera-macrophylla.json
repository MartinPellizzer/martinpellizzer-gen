    "intro": "Hedera macrophylla, commonly known as the giant ivy or Persian ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features large, dark green, leathery leaves that are typically 5-9 inches in length, with a waxy surface and a prominent central vein. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by dark blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls and structures. Hedera macrophylla is also valued for its air-purifying properties and its ability to tolerate a variety of soil conditions."
