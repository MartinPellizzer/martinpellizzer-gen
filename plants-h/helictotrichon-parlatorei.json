    "intro": "Helictotrichon parlatorei, commonly known as the Parlatore's bluegrass, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny blue to purple flowers, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
