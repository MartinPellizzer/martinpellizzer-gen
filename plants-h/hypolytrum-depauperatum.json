    "intro": "Hypolytrum depauperatum, commonly known as the poor man's grass, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Poaceae. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its modest appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes overlooked but plays a part in supporting local biodiversity."
