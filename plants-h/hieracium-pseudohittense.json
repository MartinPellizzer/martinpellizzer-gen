    "intro": "Hieracium pseudohittense, commonly known as the Hittite hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
