    "intro": "Hieracium maurostylum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. It is a perennial herb that can form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
