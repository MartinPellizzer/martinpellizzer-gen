    "intro": "Hartogia adenocaulis, commonly known as the coastal daisy, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has fibrous roots and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It is often found in coastal dune environments, where it withstands salt spray and strong winds. Hartogia adenocaulis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sands and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
