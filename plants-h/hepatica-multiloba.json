    "intro": "Hepatica multiloba, commonly known as the five-lobed liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves that resemble a liver shape. The plant produces showy, nodding flowers in shades of white, blue, or purple, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are often hairy and have a waxy coating, which helps protect it from frost and moisture loss. Hepatica multiloba thrives in woodland soils and is an important early bloomer in forest ecosystems."
