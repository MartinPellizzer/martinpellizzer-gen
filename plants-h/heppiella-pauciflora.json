    "intro": "Heppiella pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered heppiella, is a rare and delicate plant belonging to the family Pterostomataceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and is typically found in specific, often moist habitats. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually pale green or white, and they bloom in late spring or early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
