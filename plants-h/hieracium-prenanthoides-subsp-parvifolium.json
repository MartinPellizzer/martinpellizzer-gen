    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. parvifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowering heads are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a disk shape, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich habitats and can be an indicator of soil fertility."
