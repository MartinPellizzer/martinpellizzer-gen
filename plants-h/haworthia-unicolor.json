    "intro": "Haworthia unicolor, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with white markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is characterized by its ability to store water in its thick, fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant. It produces tall, branched flower stems with white or yellow flowers during the summer months. Haworthia unicolor prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
