    "intro": "Helianthus truncatus, commonly known as the roughleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features upright stems covered in coarse, hairy texture, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, serrated margin. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woodlands and disturbed sites. Helianthus truncatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for pollinators."
