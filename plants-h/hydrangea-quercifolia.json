    "intro": "Hydrangea quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble the shape of an oak leaf, which turn from green to red or orange in the fall. The plant produces cone-like flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Its seasonal foliage and floral display make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
