It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and clustered, violet-blue flower heads. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which are attractive to pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and often have a slightly grayish appearance due to fine pubescence. This species is adapted to grow in dry, open habitats and is often found in meadows and along roadsides."
