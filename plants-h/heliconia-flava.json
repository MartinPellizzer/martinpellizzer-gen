    "intro": "Heliconia flava, commonly known as the yellow heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, banana-like inflorescence that is typically bright yellow in color. The plant belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to the nectar-rich bracts."
