    "intro": "Hoffmannseggia oxycarpa subsp. oxycarpa, commonly known as the mountain hoffmannseggia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in the Andean regions of Peru and Bolivia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the cooler months. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often covered in a fine pubescence, aiding in water retention. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens due to its hardiness and adaptability."
