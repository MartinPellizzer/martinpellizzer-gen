    "intro": "Hillia maguirei, commonly known as the Maguire's hillia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hillia maguirei is considered a vulnerable species."
