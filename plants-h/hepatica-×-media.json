    "intro": "Hepatica \u00d7 media, commonly known as the hybrid liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to woodland areas in eastern North America. It features distinctive trifoliate leaves that are often bluish-green with a waxy coating, and it blooms with delicate, five-petaled flowers in shades of white, pink, and blue. The plant typically grows to a height of 6 to 12 inches and thrives in partial to full shade with moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers appear in early spring, often before the leaves fully unfurl, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens and natural habitats. Hepatica \u00d7 media is also valued for its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in forest ecosystems."
