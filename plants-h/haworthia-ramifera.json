It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically fleshy and covered in a white, waxy coating. The leaves are usually green with distinct, radial markings and can develop a reddish tinge when exposed to bright light. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the spring or summer months. This plant is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
