    "intro": "Habenaria sartor, commonly known as the Sartor's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a prominent lip, which is a key feature in orchid identification. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
