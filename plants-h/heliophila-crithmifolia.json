    "intro": "Heliophila crithmifolia, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and silver-gray, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in maritime climates. Its flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila crithmifolia is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in coastal gardens."
