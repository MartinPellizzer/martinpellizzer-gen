    "intro": "Hedysarum fruticosum subsp. laeve, commonly known as the smooth shrub vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems and trifoliate leaves, with each leaflet being ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny habitats. Hedysarum fruticosum subsp. laeve is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to fix nitrogen and stabilize soil."
