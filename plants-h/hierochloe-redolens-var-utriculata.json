It is characterized by its delicate, tufted growth habit and fine, silky leaves that emit a subtle, pleasant aroma. The plant produces small, spikelike inflorescences containing numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along streambanks. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of ecological restoration projects and a subject of interest in botanical research."
