    "intro": "Hypolepis helenensis, commonly known as the Helen's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dryopteridaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, deeply lobed fronds. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spores are released from the sori located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive cycle."
