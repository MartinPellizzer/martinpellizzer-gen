    "intro": "Hymenophyllum osmundoides, commonly known as the fern moss, is a small, delicate plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. This plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees and rocks without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its intricate structure and unique growth habits make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
