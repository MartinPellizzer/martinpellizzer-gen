    "intro": "Hemionitis angolensis, commonly known as the Angola fern, is a rare and unique species belonging to the Hemionitidaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, and often spirally arranged fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that spread along the ground and produce new shoots. It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in Angola and Namibia, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis angolensis is considered a vulnerable species."
