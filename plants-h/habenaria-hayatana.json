    "intro": "Habenaria hayatana, commonly known as the Malayan butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The plant produces delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, which are highly attractive to pollinators. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the forest floor. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
