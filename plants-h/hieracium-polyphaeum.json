    "intro": "Hieracium polyphaeum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium polyphaeum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
