    "intro": "Heteropterys nitida var. obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leafed wax tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical to ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, giving them a shiny appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
