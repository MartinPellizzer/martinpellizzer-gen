    "intro": "Hiraea borealis var. eglandulosa, commonly known as the northern hiraea, is a low-growing, perennial herb native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It typically features small, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to cold climates. The plant produces tiny, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to extreme environmental conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh northern ecosystems."
