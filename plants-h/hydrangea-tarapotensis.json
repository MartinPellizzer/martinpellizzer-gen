It belongs to the Hydrangeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and blue, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial shade. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence.
