    "intro": "Habenaria debilis, commonly known as the weak orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and forest floors. The plant features a slender, often branched stem with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. Habenaria debilis is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
