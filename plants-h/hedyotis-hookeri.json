    "intro": "Hedyotis hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds.
