    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. pljackavicense, commonly known as the Pljackavice hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
