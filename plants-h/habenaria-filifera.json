    "intro": "Habenaria filifera, commonly known as the thread-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on rocky or humus-rich substrates. The plant features a slender, upright stem with few leaves, and its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in a raceme. It produces a single, elongated, thread-like pseudobulb, which is characteristic of many orchid species. The plant is noted for its delicate appearance and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
