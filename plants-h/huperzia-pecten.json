    "intro": "Huperzia pecten, commonly known as the feather moss, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Huperzia pecten is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of many forest ecosystems."
