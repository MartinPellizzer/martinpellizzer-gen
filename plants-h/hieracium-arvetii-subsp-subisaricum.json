    "intro": "Hieracium arvetii subsp. subisaricum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and linear, often hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. It has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
