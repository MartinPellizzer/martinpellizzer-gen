    "intro": "Haplopappus enormidens, commonly known as the large-headed pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and thrives in full sun, displaying a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are usually linear and grayish-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The showy, yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
