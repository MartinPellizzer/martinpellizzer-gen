    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. arnoldianum, commonly known as Arnold's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head. Its flowers are surrounded by phyllaries, which are leaf-like structures that protect the flower head. The subspecies is characterized by its distinct morphology and is often found in moist, temperate regions."
