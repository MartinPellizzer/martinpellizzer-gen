It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in racemes, and the leaves are opposite, elliptic to ovate in shape. Hedyotis ramarowii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
