    "intro": "Hieracium rhomboidale, commonly known as the rhomboid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are rhombic in shape, hence its scientific name. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
