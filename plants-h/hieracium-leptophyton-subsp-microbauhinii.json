    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. microbauhinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal capitulum with ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
