    "intro": "Hortensia chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese holly, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, dark green leaves that remain throughout the winter. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red berries in the fall. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Hortensia chinensis is also valued for its use in traditional Chinese medicine."
