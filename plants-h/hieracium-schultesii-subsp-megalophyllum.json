It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and can grow up to 1 meter in height. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in some regions."
