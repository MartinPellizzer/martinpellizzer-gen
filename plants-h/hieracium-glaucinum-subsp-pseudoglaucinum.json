    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. pseudoglaucinum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and woodland edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually covered in a whitish or bluish waxy coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, which are typically pale yellow to white. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
