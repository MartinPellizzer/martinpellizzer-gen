    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum, commonly known as the silver carpet carnation, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming foliage covered in silvery-gray hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for xeriscaping and garden design."
