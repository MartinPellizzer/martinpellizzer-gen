It is characterized by its soft, hairy leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, dark seeds. Hibiscus leiospermus typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
