    "intro": "Heloniopsis leucantha, commonly known as the white heloniopsis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
