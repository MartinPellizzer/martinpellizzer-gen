    "intro": "Helianthella uniflora, commonly known as the singleflower helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The single, showy flower at the top of each stem blooms in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
