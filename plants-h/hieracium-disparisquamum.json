It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. Its leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, scaly hairs, which gives it its common name. Hieracium disparisquamum is typically found in moist environments and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
