    "intro": "Hemiachyris glutinosa, commonly known as sticky false fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The sticky secretions on its leaves and stems give it its common name and help deter herbivores."
