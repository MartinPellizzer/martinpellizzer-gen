    "intro": "Haageocereus \u00d7 comosus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of white, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, yellow fruits that are edible. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Its unique nocturnal blooming habit makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and collectors."
