    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. laeviceps, commonly known as the smooth-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. This subspecies is distinguished by its relatively smooth stem and lack of glandular hairs, setting it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus."
