It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, and its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium permaculatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
