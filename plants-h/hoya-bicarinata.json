    "intro": "Hoya bicarinata, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya bicarinata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a favored choice among indoor gardeners."
