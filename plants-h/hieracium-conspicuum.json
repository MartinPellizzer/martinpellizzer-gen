    "intro": "Hieracium conspicuum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow-orange flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow to white ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. Hieracium conspicuum is often found in open habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens."
