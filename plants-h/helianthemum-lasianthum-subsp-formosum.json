    "intro": "Helianthemum lasianthum subsp. formosum, commonly known as the showy rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, star-shaped flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are typically small, glandular, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
