It is characterized by its upright growth habit and compound leaves that are pinnately arranged. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum xanthinum is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
