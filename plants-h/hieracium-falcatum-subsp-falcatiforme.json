    "intro": "Hieracium falcatum subsp. falcatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its horticultural appeal and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
