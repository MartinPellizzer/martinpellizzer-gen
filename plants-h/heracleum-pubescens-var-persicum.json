The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive hairy texture, and the plant is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
