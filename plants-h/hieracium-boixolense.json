It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single inflorescence. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grasslands. It has small, hairy leaves and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain areas."
