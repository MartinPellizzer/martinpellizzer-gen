    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum var. borneense, commonly known as the ant plant, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It forms a hollow, cup-like structure on its stem that serves as a home for ants, which in turn protect the plant from herbivores. The plant's morphology includes a dense network of roots and a specialized leaf that secretes nectar to attract ants. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees in the understory of tropical forests. Its symbiotic relationship with ants is a key feature of its ecological niche."
