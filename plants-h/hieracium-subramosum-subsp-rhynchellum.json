    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. rhynchellum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
