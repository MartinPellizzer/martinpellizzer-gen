    "intro": "Homalolepis intermedia, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or alpine regions. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Homalolepis intermedia is an important component of New Zealand's native flora and is valued for its ornamental and ecological significance."
