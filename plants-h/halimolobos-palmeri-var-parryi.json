    "intro": "Halimolobos palmeri var. parryi, commonly known as the Parry's halimolobos, is a perennial shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a hardy species in desert ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in some regions."
