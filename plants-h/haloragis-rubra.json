    "intro": "Haloragis rubra, commonly known as the redflower waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of bright red flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of still or slow-moving water. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that help stabilize the soil. Haloragis rubra plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
