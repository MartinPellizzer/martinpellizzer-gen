It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium subsuomense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread quickly."
