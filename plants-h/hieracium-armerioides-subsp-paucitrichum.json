    "intro": "Hieracium armerioides subsp. paucitrichum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are narrow and linear, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and delicate species in many regions."
