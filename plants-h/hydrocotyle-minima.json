    "intro": "Hydrocotyle minima, commonly known as little water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture. Its flowers are tiny, white, and clustered in umbels, making it a subtle yet distinctive species. Hydrocotyle minima plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through oxygen production."
