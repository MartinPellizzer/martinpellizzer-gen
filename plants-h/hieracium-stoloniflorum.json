    "intro": "Hieracium stoloniflorum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and forms dense mats through its stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. Hieracium stoloniflorum is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides, where it can become invasive in certain regions."
