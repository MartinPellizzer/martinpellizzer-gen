    "intro": "Helianthella mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican sunflower or Mexican helianthemum, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with succulent, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helianthella mexicana is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its vibrant blooms and drought-tolerant nature."
