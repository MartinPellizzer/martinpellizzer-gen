    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-stalked filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its small, translucent, and often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, and the plant lacks true roots, relying instead on rhizomes for nutrient absorption. Due to its fragile nature, it is often found in protected microhabitats where it can maintain the high humidity required for survival."
