    "intro": "Hoya epedunculata, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, waxy flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya epedunculata is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
