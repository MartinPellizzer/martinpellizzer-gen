It features a cylindrical stem covered in spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding ornamental value. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it stores water in its thick, fleshy stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid environments."
