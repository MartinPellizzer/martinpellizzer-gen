It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms a dense mat of silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, adding a subtle ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. Due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and rock gardens."
