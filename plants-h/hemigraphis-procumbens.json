It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense carpet of foliage. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a metallic sheen, especially when wet. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments."
