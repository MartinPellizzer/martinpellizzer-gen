    "intro": "Hypericum glandulosum, commonly known as sticky St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and glandular, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full sun. Its leaves are opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly serrated margin. Hypericum glandulosum is often used in native plant gardens due to its ecological value and ornamental appeal."
