    "intro": "Hedera donerailensis minor, commonly known as the Donerailensis ivy, is a rare and lesser-known species within the Araliaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge. Native to a limited geographic region in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its climbing habit allows it to scale trees and structures, making it a unique addition to botanical collections. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is not commonly cultivated outside of specialized horticultural settings."
