    "intro": "Hedysarum gypsaceum, commonly known as the gypsum peavine, is a perennial legume native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils, often found on gypsum or limestone substrates. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod fruits containing several seeds. Its deep root system allows it to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Hedysarum gypsaceum is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife."
