    "intro": "Hedysarum polymorphum, commonly known as the variable milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Hedysarum polymorphum has a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
