It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its unique appearance and adaptability make it a popular choice for rock gardens and drought-tolerant landscapes.
