    "intro": "Hieracium carolinianum f. alpestre, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a variant of the common hawkweed characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more densely packed flower heads. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, rocky slopes, and forest clearings. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. This subspecies is adapted to cooler, more arid conditions compared to its typical counterparts."
