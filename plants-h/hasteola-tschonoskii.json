    "intro": "Hasteola tschonoskii, commonly known as the Tschonoskii grass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, wiry leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Hasteola tschonoskii is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in rocky habitats."
