It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically found in clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soil conditions, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical features make it an important species for wetland ecosystems and ecological restoration projects."
