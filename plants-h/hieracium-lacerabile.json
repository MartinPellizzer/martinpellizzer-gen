    "intro": "Hieracium lacerabile, commonly known as the torn hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
