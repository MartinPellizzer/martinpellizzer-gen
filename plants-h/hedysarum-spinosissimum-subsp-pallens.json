    "intro": "Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. pallens, commonly known as the pale thorned vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spiny stems and trifoliate leaves, with small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine meadows. Hedysarum spinosissimum subsp. pallens is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a food source for grazing animals."
