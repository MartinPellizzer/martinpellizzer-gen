    "intro": "Houstonia trichotoma, commonly known as the hairy blue-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. Houstonia trichotoma thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodlands or along stream banks. Its hairy stems and leaves are adaptations that help it retain moisture in its preferred habitat."
