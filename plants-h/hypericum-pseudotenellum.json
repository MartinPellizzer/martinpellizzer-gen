    "intro": "Hypericum pseudotenellum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for coastal and maritime gardens due to its hardiness and drought tolerance."
