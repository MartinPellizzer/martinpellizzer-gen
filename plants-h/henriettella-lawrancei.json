    "intro": "Henriettella lawrancei, commonly known as the Lawrence's henriettella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cooler, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, facing threats from habitat loss and climate change. Its unique botanical features make it an important subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
