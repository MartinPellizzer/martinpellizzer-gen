    "intro": "Halosarcia leptoclada subsp. inclusa, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline environments. The plant produces small, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple, blooming in the morning. Its leaves are ovate and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is often found along the coastline, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
