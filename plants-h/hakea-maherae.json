    "intro": "Hakea maherae, commonly known as the Maherae hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It belongs to the Proteaceae family and is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce small, red or yellow flowers. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Hakea maherae is often found in coastal and sandy regions, where it plays a role in stabilizing dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
