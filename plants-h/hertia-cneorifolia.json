    "intro": "Hertia cneorifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. The plant has basal rosettes of silver-gray, woolly leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually greenish-white and appear in clusters, followed by small, fleshy berries. Hertia cneorifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
