    "intro": "Hieracium attractum subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and streambanks. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. The subspecies coriaceum is distinguished by its thick, leathery leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier conditions."
