    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. deinacladium, commonly known as the dark-staining hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers and hairy, basal leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. It produces small, dark brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker coloration and specific morphological traits compared to other hawkweed species."
