    "intro": "Haplopappus nuttallii var. depressus, commonly known as the lowleaf horsebrush, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its low-growing habit and silver-gray foliage. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in the spring. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments."
