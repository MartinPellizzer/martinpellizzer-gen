    "intro": "Heterocentron breedlovei, commonly known as the Florida starflower, is a rare and endangered flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Onagraceae family and is characterized by its star-shaped, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, while its stems are often prostrate or ascending. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for the survival of this unique species."
