    "intro": "Hysterobaeckea graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock-heath, is a small evergreen shrub native to the south-western regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers during the autumn season, which are often accompanied by a strong, unpleasant odor. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh, arid conditions of its natural habitat. Hysterobaeckea graniticola is an important component of the local flora and is often found in rocky outcrops and gravelly soils."
