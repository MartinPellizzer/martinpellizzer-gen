    "intro": "Hakea triternata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom in spring. It is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Hakea triternata is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
