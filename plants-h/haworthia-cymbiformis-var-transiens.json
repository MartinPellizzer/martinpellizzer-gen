The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are often arranged in a rosette pattern, and it is well adapted to arid environments. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
