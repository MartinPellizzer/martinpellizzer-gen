    "intro": "Hilliardia, commonly known as the silverleaf plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is native to the Americas, particularly found in regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. The plants are characterized by their silver-gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence covering the leaves. Hilliardia species typically grow as shrubs or subshrubs, often with stout, branching stems. They produce small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, adding ornamental value to gardens."
