    "intro": "Haworthia turgida f. caespitosa, commonly known as the compact Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pinkish markings, providing a striking visual contrast. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers on tall, slender stems during the growing season. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its leaves and requiring minimal watering. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor cultivation."
