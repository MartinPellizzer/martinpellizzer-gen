It features striking, sword-shaped leaves that are often reddish or purple at the base. The plant produces dense clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its bulbs are fleshy and store water, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soil."
