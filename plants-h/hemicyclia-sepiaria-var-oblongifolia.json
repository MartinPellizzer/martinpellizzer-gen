    "intro": "Hemicyclia sepiaria var. oblongifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer, often surrounded by spiky, leaf-like bracts. The plant has a compact growth habit and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hemicyclia sepiaria var. oblongifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance and resilience to coastal conditions."
