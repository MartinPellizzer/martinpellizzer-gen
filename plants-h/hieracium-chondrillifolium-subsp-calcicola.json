    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. calcicola, commonly known as the limestone buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to calcareous grasslands in Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in early summer, and its hairy, lobed leaves that are adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is often found in open, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and limestone soils. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is distinguished by its composite flower heads. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species for calcareous ecosystems."
