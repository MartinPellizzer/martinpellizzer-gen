    "intro": "Hydrocleis, commonly known as the marsh frog or pond frog, is a genus of aquatic frogs found in various parts of Africa. These frogs are typically small, with a body length ranging from 3 to 5 centimeters. They have smooth, moist skin that helps them absorb oxygen from water, and they often have distinctive coloration patterns for camouflage. Hydrocleis species are usually found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and temporary pools. Their life cycle includes an aquatic larval stage, followed by metamorphosis into adults that return to water for breeding and survival."
