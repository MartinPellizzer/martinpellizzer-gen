It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure. It is a perennial herb that blooms from late spring to early summer."
