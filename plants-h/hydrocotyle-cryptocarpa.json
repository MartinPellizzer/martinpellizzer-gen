    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cryptocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant has delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with the stems submerged beneath. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits. Hydrocotyle cryptocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
