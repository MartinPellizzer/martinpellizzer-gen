    "intro": "Helianthemum halimifolium proles involucratum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to June. The plant has silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
