    "intro": "Hymenophyllum cruentum, commonly known as the red fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of hair, which helps retain moisture. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered on the underside of the leaves. Hymenophyllum cruentum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in humid, rocky habitats."
