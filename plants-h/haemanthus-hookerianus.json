It features tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright orange-red flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has strap-like, glossy green leaves that are narrow and grass-like in appearance. It is well adapted to full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers and architectural form."
