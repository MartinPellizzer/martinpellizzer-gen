    "intro": "Habrothamnus aureus, commonly known as the golden sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, linear leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in desert scrub habitats. Due to its resilience and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in xeriscapes and native plant gardens."
