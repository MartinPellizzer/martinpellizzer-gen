It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and gelatinous, sticky berries. The plant attaches to its host trees using haustoria, which allow it to extract water and nutrients. It thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in secondary forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
