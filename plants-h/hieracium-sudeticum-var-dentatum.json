    "intro": "Hieracium sudeticum var. dentatum, commonly known as the Southern Field Dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, bright yellow flower head. The leaves are typically lanceolate and have serrated margins, which distinguish it from other dandelion varieties. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in waste areas. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
