    "intro": "Hieracium heterodon, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
