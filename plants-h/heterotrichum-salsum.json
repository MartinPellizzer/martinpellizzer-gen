    "intro": "Heterotrichum salsum, commonly known as the salt marsh moss, is a species of liverwort that thrives in saline environments. It is characterized by its small, closely packed leaves and is often found in coastal areas where saltwater meets land. The plant has a simple thalloid structure, which allows it to tolerate high salinity levels. It plays an important role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in salt marsh ecosystems. Due to its specialized adaptations, Heterotrichum salsum is an indicator species for coastal habitats."
