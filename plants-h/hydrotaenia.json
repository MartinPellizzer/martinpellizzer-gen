    "intro": "Hydrotaenia, commonly known as water ferns, are aquatic or semi-aquatic plants belonging to the family Marsileaceae. They typically have small, floating or submerged leaves that are often divided into four parts, resembling a cloverleaf shape. These plants are found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Their rhizomes help anchor them to the substrate, and they can form dense mats that provide habitat for aquatic life. Hydrotaenia species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and are often indicators of eutrophic conditions."
