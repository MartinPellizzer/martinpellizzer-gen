    "intro": "Humboltia bivalvis, commonly known as the split-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its distinctive leaves, which are deeply lobed and often resemble a split or a bivalve shell, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. Humboltia bivalvis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
