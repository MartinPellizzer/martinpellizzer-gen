It is a low-growing shrub that produces vibrant yellow flowers, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. It is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens or coastal areas. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in its native habitat."
