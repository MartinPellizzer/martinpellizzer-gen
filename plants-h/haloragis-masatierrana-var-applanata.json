    "intro": "Haloragis masatierrana var. applanata, commonly known as the flat-leaved waterwheel plant, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, flat leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, typically emerging from the water, which attract various pollinators. It thrives in brackish or freshwater environments, often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. This variant is notable for its adaptability to fluctuating water levels and salinity, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
