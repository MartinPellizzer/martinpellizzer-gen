    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum subsp. songaricum, commonly known as the Songaric St. John's Wort, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive leaf venation, with translucent dots that give it a unique appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry habitats and is known for its medicinal properties. It is closely related to other species of Hypericum, sharing similar chemical compounds such as hypericin and pseudohypericin. However, it is less commonly used in modern herbal medicine compared to H. perforatum."
