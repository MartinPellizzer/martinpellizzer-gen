    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirta var. partita, commonly known as the hairy arrowhead, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the warmer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in wet or moist environments. It is often found in marshy areas, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats."
