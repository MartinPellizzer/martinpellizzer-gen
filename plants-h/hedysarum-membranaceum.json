    "intro": "Hedysarum membranaceum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The plant has a deep taproot system, which allows it to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its flowers are pollinated by bees and other insects, and it produces small, flat, brown pods that contain several seeds. Hedysarum membranaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
