    "intro": "Hieracium crenulentum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
