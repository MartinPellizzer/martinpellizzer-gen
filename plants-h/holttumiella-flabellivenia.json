    "intro": "Holttumiella flabellivenia, commonly known as the flabelliform holttumiella, is a rare and unusual plant species belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, fan-shaped leaves that give it its common name. The plant is native to specific regions in South America, particularly in the Andean foothills. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically displaying a pale yellow to greenish hue. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
