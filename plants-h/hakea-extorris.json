    "intro": "Hakea extorris, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, typically blooming in spring. Hakea extorris is adapted to arid environments, with deep roots that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
