    "intro": "Hieracium subflorescens, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in a compact cluster at the end of each stem. Hieracium subflorescens is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is considered a weed in some regions."
