It is a low-growing herb with opposite, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring and summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
