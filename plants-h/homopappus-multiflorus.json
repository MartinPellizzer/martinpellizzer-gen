    "intro": "Homopappus multiflorus, commonly known as the multibract sunflower, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive involucral bracts. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets, which are typically tubular in shape. Its leaves are typically alternate, oblanceolate, and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces achenes with pappus structures, aiding in wind dispersal of its seeds."
