    "intro": "Hermione tazetta var. sexlobata, commonly known as the six-lobed narcissus, is a botanical variant of the daffodil genus. It is characterized by its distinctive six-lobed petals, which set it apart from the typical single-lobed form of Tazetta daffodils. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its bright, cheerful blossoms."
