It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and vibrant, showy flowers that bloom in winter. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Its ability to produce flowers during the holiday season adds to its ornamental value."
