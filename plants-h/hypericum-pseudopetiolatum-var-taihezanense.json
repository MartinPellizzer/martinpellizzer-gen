It is a herbaceous perennial with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in summer. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
