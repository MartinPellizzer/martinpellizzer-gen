It belongs to the Dilleniaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with narrow, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Hibbertia altigena is well adapted to dry and sandy soils, and it thrives in full sun, making it a common sight in coastal and inland regions of Australia.
