    "intro": "Huperzia cumingii, commonly known as the Cuming's clubmoss, is a species of evergreen fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that give it a mossy appearance. Native to regions of East Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically located at the base of the leaves. Huperzia cumingii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
