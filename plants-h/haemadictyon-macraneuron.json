    "intro": "Haemadictyon macraneuron, commonly known as the giant waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its large, floating, circular leaves. The leaves are typically 1 to 2 meters in diameter and are divided into numerous narrow, ribbon-like segments that radiate outward from a central vein. These segments are designed to trap air, allowing the plant to float on the water's surface. The plant is native to tropical and subtropical regions and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Its distinctive appearance and ecological role make it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
