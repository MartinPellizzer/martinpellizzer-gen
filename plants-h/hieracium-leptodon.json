    "intro": "Hieracium leptodon, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium leptodon is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through its flowering heads, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
