    "intro": "Hakea heliosperma, commonly known as the sunball hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that resemble small sunbursts, typically blooming in yellow or orange during spring. The plant has woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and sandy environments. Hakea heliosperma is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
