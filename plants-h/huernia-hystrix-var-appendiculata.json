It features a thick, fleshy stem covered in sharp, spiny tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with plenty of sunlight. Its unique morphology makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
