It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers in late summer. The plant has a taproot system and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Botanically, it is notable for its complex inflorescence and its role in ecological succession."
