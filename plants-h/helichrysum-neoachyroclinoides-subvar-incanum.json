    "intro": "Helichrysum neoachyroclinoides subvar. incanum, commonly known as the silver woolly everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, fluffy yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative plant due to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established. The subspecies incanum is distinguished by its particularly fine, woolly texture and pale coloration."
