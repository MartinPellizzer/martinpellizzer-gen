    "intro": "Hieracium eurycranum, commonly known as the broad-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are generally lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium eurycranum is often found in disturbed sites and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural fields."
