    "intro": "Hieracium liptoviense subsp. coinotokum, commonly known as the Liptovian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, preferring well-drained soils. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom from June to August. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
