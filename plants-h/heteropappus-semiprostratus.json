    "intro": "Heteropappus semiprostratus, commonly known as the prostrate aster, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with a mat-forming habit, characterized by its branching stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent white ray florets, typically blooming in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are linear to oblanceolate, with a hairy surface, and the plant is often found in dry, disturbed soils. Heteropappus semiprostratus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
