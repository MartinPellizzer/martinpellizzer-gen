It is characterized by its reduced or absent glandular structures on the leaves, distinguishing it from the typical form. The plant belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to Central and South America. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. This form is often studied for its morphological variations and ecological adaptations."
