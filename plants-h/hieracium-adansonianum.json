    "intro": "Hieracium adansonianum, commonly known as the Adanson's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of basal leaves with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium adansonianum is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
