    "intro": "Hedera combwoodiana, commonly known as the combwood ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves that have a distinctive comb-like pattern on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on trees or walls. Hedera combwoodiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover vertical surfaces effectively."
