    "intro": "Heptapleurum vitiense, commonly known as the Vitiense Stagshorn, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Vanuatu. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
