    "intro": "Hakea maritima, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant features needle-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in cylindrical spikes, and are adapted for pollination by birds and insects. Hakea maritima is also known for its hardy nature and resilience to coastal winds and salt spray."
