    "intro": "Hibiscus grandidieri var. manamboloensis, commonly known as the Manambolo hibiscus, is a rare and endemic species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink, with a prominent central stigma. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in dense forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps retain moisture. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
