It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have serrated edges. Hieracium \u00d7 alleghaniense is a hybrid species, resulting from the cross between Hieracium auripunctatum and Hieracium pilosellum."
