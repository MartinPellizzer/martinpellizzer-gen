    "intro": "Halesia tetraptera var. carnea, commonly known as the pink-flowered halesia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, pink to reddish-purple inflorescences that appear in early spring before the leaves emerge. The plant has simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves with smooth margins and a glossy upper surface. Its flowers are clustered in pendulous racemes and are pollinated primarily by insects. The bark is smooth and grayish-white, becoming fissured with age, and the plant is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
