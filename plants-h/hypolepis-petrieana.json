    "intro": "Hypolepis petrieana, commonly known as the rock fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant has pinnately compound fronds with a distinctive, serrated margin. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense, fibrous layer, which helps in anchoring it to rocky substrates. Hypolepis petrieana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types."
