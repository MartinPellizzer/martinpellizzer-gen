    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. basicuneatum, commonly known as the two-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology, featuring a basal pair of lobes that are more pronounced than in other members of the species. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many parts of its range."
