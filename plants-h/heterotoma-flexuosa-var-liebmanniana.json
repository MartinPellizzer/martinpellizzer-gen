It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on bark or stone in temperate forest environments. The plant exhibits a foliose growth form with a leathery texture and a distinct, often bright green or yellowish coloration. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ecological role in nutrient cycling. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and sensitive indicator of environmental health."
