    "intro": "Habenaria leucophaea, commonly known as the white-lipped twayblade, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or swampy areas. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its specialized mycorrhizal relationships with fungi. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
