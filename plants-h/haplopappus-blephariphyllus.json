It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, linear leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, persistent pappus structures that aid in seed dispersal. Haplopappus blephariphyllus is generally found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands."
