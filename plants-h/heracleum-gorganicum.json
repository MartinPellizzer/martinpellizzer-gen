    "intro": "Heracleum gorganicum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall biennial or perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature and harmful effects, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
