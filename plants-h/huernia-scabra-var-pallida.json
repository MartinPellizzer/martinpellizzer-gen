It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are covered in white to pale green tubercles. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the base of the stem. It is a slow-growing species that thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
