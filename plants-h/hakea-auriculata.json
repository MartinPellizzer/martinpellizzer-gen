    "intro": "Hakea auriculata, commonly known as the ear-shaped hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, ear-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea auriculata is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, and it is drought-tolerant once established. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also important in local ecosystems."
