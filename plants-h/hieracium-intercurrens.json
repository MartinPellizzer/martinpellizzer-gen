    "intro": "Hieracium intercurrens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its clusters of yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas. Its foliage and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties."
