It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a distinctive central disc. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
