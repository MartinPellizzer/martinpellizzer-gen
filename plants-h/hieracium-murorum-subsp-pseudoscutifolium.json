It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated, narrow leaves and yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened plant in many regions."
