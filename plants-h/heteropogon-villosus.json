    "intro": "Heteropogon villosus, commonly known as the hairy panic grass, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy foliage. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough, textured surface due to the presence of fine hairs.
