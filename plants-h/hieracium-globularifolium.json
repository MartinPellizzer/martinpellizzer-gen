    "intro": "Hieracium globularifolium, commonly known as the globe-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that form a dense, low-growing cluster. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its fibrous root system allows it to colonize and persist in a variety of soil types."
