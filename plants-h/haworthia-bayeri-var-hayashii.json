    "intro": "Haworthia bayeri var. hayashii, commonly known as the Hayashii Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal watering to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
