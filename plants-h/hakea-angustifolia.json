    "intro": "Hakea angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that appear in winter and early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species well adapted to coastal and sandy soils. Hakea angustifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
