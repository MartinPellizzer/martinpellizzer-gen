    "intro": "Hypolepis flexuosa, commonly known as the flexible shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, leathery, shield-shaped fronds that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are divided into numerous pinnae, which are often curled at the edges, giving the plant its distinctive appearance."
