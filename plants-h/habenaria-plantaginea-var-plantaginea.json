    "intro": "Habenaria plantaginea var. plantaginea, commonly known as the showy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, often fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces small, oval-shaped pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in various environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the base of the plant. This orchid thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or grassland habitats."
