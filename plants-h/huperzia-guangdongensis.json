    "intro": "Huperzia guangdongensis, commonly known as the Guangdong clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is native to southern China, particularly Guangdong Province, and thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant has a distinctive appearance with upright, segmented stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense clusters. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Huperzia guangdongensis plays a role in maintaining soil stability and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
