    "intro": "Heliconia alba, commonly known as the white heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, boat-shaped inflorescence that is predominantly white with green streaks, giving it a unique and ornamental appearance. The plant belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value in gardens and as a cut flower. Its leaves are broad and waxy, contributing to its ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Heliconia alba also plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich bracts."
