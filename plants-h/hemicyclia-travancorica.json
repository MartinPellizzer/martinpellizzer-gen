    "intro": "Hemicyclia travancorica, commonly known as the Travancore cycad, is a unique cycad species native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnate leaves that are dark green and leathery. The plant produces cones, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants, a feature typical of cycads. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the tropical climate of its native region. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
