    "intro": "Hippophae gyantsensis, commonly known as the Tibetan sandthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and adjacent areas. It is characterized by its small, yellow-orange berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. The species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
