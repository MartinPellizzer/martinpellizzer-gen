    "intro": "Helianthopsis lodicata, commonly known as the golden cupflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are gray-green and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Helianthopsis lodicata is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
