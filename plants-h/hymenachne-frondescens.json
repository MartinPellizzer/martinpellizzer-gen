    "intro": "Hymenachne frondescens, commonly known as the narrowleaf hymenachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along waterways, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant has slender, erect stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Hymenachne frondescens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
