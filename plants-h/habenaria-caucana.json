    "intro": "Habenaria caucana, commonly known as the Caucan Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
