    "intro": "Hieracium funereum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium funereum is often found in clusters, with hairy stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height."
