    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium plicatifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, pinnately lobed leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
