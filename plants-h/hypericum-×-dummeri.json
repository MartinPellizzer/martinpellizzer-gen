    "intro": "Hypericum \u00d7 dummeri, commonly known as the hybrid St. John's wort, is a flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Hypericum perforatum (common St. John's wort) and Hypericum hirsutum (rough St. John's wort). The plant is characterized by its yellow flowers, which are typically tubular and contain four stamens. It has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Hypericum \u00d7 dummeri is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
