    "intro": "Hieracium incurvum, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves that curve inward, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in dry, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
