    "intro": "Herrania lemniscata, commonly known as the sacred lotus of the Andes, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as cloud forests and riverbanks. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often covered in a waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and cultural significance in indigenous communities."
