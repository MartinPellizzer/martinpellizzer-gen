It is characterized by its long, narrow leaves that are often submerged in water, with some leaves emerging above the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are arranged in clusters, typically blooming in the spring. Hygrophila baronii is often used in aquatic gardens and as a decorative plant in ponds. It prefers still or slow-moving water and can thrive in a variety of soil types when planted in shallow water."
