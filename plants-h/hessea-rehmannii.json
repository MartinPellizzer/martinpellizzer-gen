    "intro": "Hessea rehmannii, commonly known as the coastal hens and chicks, is a succulent plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette-forming structure with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white powder. The plant produces small, yellow flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It is adapted to arid and salty environments, making it highly resilient to coastal conditions. Hessea rehmannii is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
