    "intro": "Hieracium bourgaei subsp. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green leaves and its showy yellow flowers with a distinctive red or orange center. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has a hairy stem and produces small, bract-like leaves along its flowering stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its two-toned flower heads, which contribute to its ornamental value in horticulture."
