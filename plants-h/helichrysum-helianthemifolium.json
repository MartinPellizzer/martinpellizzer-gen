    "intro": "Helichrysum helianthemifolium, commonly known as the golden everlasting or Cape goldflame, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that are densely packed in compact clusters, giving it a fiery appearance. The plant has silvery-gray, hairy leaves that are oval-shaped and arranged alternately along the stems. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are long-lasting when dried, which has led to its use in floral arrangements and traditional medicine."
