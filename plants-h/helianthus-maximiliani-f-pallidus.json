    "intro": "Helianthus maximiliani f. pallidus, commonly known as the pale helianthus, is a flowering plant native to the central and southern United States. It is a variant of the common sunflower, characterized by its pale yellow to white ray flowers and shorter, more compact stature. The plant typically grows in prairie and open woodland habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces numerous seeds in its composite flower head. The pale helianthus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use by indigenous peoples for food and medicinal purposes."
