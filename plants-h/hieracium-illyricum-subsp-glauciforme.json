    "intro": "Hieracium illyricum subsp. glauciforme, commonly known as the Illyrian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Its subspecies status reflects distinct morphological features, including a bluish-gray leaf coating, which helps distinguish it from other hawkweed species."
