    "intro": "Herniaria fruticosa var. erecta, commonly known as the upright sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It thrives in sandy and gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs where it is exposed to salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems, and bloom from late spring to early summer. This species is well adapted to harsh maritime environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects along shorelines."
