    "intro": "Hemianthus punctatus, commonly known as the dwarf chain sword, is a small, carpet-forming aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length, arranged in a dense, mat-like structure. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often submerged, contributing to its role in freshwater ecosystems. It thrives in slow-moving to still waters with soft, acidic substrates. Due to its compact size and aesthetic appeal, it is popular in aquariums and planted ponds."
