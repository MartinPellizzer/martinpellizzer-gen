    "intro": "Hedera helix var. cavendishii, commonly known as the Cavendish ivy, is a variant of the common English ivy. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically broader and more heart-shaped compared to other ivy varieties. This plant is a climbing or trailing evergreen vine with small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The Cavendish ivy is native to Europe and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded areas. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate to high humidity, making it suitable for indoor cultivation as well."
