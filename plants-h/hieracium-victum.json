It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. Hieracium victum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in certain regions."
