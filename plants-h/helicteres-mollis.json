    "intro": "Helicteres mollis, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sweetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, which later develop into spiny, woody pods containing seeds. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Helicteres mollis is also noted for its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its tolerance to drought conditions."
