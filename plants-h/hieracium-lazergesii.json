    "intro": "Hieracium lazergesii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium lazergesii is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate its habitat."
