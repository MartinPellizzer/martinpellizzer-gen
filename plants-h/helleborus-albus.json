It is characterized by its evergreen, palmate leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces showy, white, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring, often before the leaves appear. Helleborus albus is part of the Ranunculaceae family and is known for its toxic properties, containing various alkaloids. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils."
