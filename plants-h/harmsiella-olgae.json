    "intro": "Harmsiella olgae, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its succulent, bladder-like structures that trap small aquatic organisms, aiding in its nutrient acquisition. The plant typically grows in brackish or freshwater environments, often in coastal areas with fluctuating salinity. Its leaves are usually simple and alternate, with small, delicate flowers that are pollinated by insects. Harmsiella olgae plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
