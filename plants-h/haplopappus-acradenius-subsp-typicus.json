    "intro": "Haplopappus acradenius subsp. typicus, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial with small, narrow leaves adapted to reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are followed by small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant. Its ecological role includes providing food for pollinators and stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
