    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. pseudochlorophanes, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellowish to orange inflorescences with ray flowers. Its flowers are typically 5-lobed, and the plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its aggressive growth and competitive nature."
