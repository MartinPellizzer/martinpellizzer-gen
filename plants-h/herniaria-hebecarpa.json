    "intro": "Herniaria hebecarpa, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It features small, succulent leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize sandy soils, making it an important pioneer species in coastal dunes. Herniaria hebecarpa is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in maritime climates."
