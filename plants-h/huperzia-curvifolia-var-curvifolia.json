    "intro": "Huperzia curvifolia var. curvifolia, commonly known as the curly fern, is a species of clubmoss that exhibits distinct botanical features. It is characterized by its long, segmented stems and lance-shaped leaves that curl at the tips, giving it its common name. The plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporophytes produce spores in small, cup-like structures called sporangia, which are clustered along the leaf margins. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptability in temperate regions."
