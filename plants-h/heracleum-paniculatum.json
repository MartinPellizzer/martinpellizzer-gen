    "intro": "Heracleum paniculatum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a robust stem with a distinctive, hollow, ridged structure and large, umbrella-like compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, aromatic scent. Cow parsnip is often found in moist meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas."
