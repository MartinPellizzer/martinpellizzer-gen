    "intro": "Haplopappus mcleanii, commonly known as the McLean's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as sagebrush steppe and rocky soils. Its small, yellow to orange flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, hairless seeds in a pappus structure that aids in wind dispersal. Haplopappus mcleanii is often found in disturbed or open habitats and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils."
