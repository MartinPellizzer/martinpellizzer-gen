    "intro": "Heliophila rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heliophyte, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201350 cm, featuring slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers clustered in loose spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in water-saturated soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Heliophila rostrata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
