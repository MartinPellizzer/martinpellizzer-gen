It is characterized by its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
