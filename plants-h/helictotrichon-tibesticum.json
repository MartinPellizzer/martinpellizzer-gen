    "intro": "Helictotrichon tibesticum, commonly known as the Tibetan feathergrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters and has slender, wiry stems covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences composed of numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often have a bluish-green hue due to the presence of dense pubescence. Helictotrichon tibesticum is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
