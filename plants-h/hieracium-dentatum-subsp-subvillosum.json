    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. subvillosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the dandelion family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
