    "intro": "Heliamphora tatei var. macdonaldae, commonly known as the Macdonald's sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its tall, tubular pitchers that secrete a sticky liquid to trap insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, relying on its specialized morphology for survival. Its leaves form a rosette, and the pitchers are often covered in fine hairs that aid in trapping prey. This variant is notable for its striking appearance and ecological adaptation to its unique habitat."
