    "intro": "Hartogia tabularis, commonly known as the flatleaf hartogia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are broad and flat, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Hartogia tabularis is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of the region."
