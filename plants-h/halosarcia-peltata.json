    "intro": "Halosarcia peltata, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with hairy stems and leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions, making it a resilient species in harsh climates. Halosarcia peltata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
