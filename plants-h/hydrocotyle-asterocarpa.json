    "intro": "Hydrocotyle asterocarpa, commonly known as the star-fruited water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has rounded, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white flowers with five petals. Its fruit is distinctive, consisting of a star-shaped cluster of small, dry capsules. Hydrocotyle asterocarpa plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through its biological activity."
