    "intro": "Harveya wysockiana, commonly known as the Wysocki's harveya, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte or lithophyte, often found on rocky outcrops or tree trunks. Its leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Harveya wysockiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
