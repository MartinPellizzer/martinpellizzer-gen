    "intro": "Hevea pauciflora var. pauciflora, commonly known as the low-flowered rubber tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with smooth, gray bark and lanceolate leaves that are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in axillary inflorescences, followed by small, round rubbery fruits. Its latex, while not as commercially significant as that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been used in traditional applications. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in tropical forests."
