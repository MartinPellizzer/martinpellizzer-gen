    "intro": "Hypolepis repens var. hostilis, commonly known as the spreading holly fern, is a variant of the broad-leafed fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, creeping rhizomes that form a carpet-like growth pattern on the forest floor. The fronds are typically bipinnate, with a distinctive dark green color and a rough, textured surface. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
