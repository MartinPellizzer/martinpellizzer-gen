    "intro": "Hoya paziae subsp. paziae, commonly known as the Peace Lily, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance, which is especially noticeable when the flowers bloom. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya paziae subsp. paziae is popular as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
