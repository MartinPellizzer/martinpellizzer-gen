    "intro": "Hydrocotyle canbyi, commonly known as the Canby's water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and marshes, where it forms dense mats on the water surface or submerged substrates. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, and it produces small, white flowers that are clustered in umbels. Its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively make it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Hydrocotyle canbyi is also notable for its role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
