    "intro": "Helichrysum bicolor, commonly known as the double sunset flower, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, daisy-like yellow and orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum bicolor is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
