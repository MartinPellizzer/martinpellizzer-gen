It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has aromatic, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit and hardy nature make it a resilient plant in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
