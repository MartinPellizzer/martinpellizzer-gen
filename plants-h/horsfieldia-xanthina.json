    "intro": "Horsfieldia xanthina, commonly known as the yellow orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers, which are typically borne on pendulous inflorescences. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing structural support and aiding in water retention. Horsfieldia xanthina is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
