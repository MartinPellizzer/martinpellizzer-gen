    "intro": "Hosackia balsamifera, commonly known as the balsamroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features a robust, upright stem with large, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in a single, terminal head. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to dry, sandy soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant is also characterized by its aromatic, balsam-scented foliage, which gives it its common name."
