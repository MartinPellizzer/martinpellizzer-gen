    "intro": "Habenaria microgymnadenia, commonly known as the dwarf fairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Native to Southeast Asia, this species thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing in forest undergrowth. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome and produces small, clustered leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
