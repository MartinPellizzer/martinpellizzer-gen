    "intro": "Hulsea vestita var. pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf hulsea, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
