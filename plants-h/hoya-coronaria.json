    "intro": "Hoya coronaria, commonly known as the Crown of the Andes, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to South America. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are often waxy and covered in a fine layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers with a distinctive crown-like appearance, typically in shades of pink and white. Hoya coronaria thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its slow growth and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
