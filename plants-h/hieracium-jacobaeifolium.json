    "intro": "Hieracium jacobaeifolium, commonly known as the Jacob's liverwort, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It is a perennial herb that can thrive in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions."
