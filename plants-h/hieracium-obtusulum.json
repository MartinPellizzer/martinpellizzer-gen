    "intro": "Hieracium obtusulum, commonly known as the bluntleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rounded base and are covered in fine hairs. The yellow flowers appear in late summer and are followed by seed heads that disperse easily, aiding in its spread."
