It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a single, terminal head. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
