    "intro": "Heracleum longifolium, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, deeply lobed leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in diameter, with a distinctive hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers arranged in an umbrella-like inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its stem is thick, hollow, and covered in reddish spots and coarse hairs. It is important to note that all parts of the plant contain phototoxic sap, making it potentially harmful to skin when exposed to sunlight."
