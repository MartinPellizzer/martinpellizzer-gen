    "intro": "Hypericum richeri subsp. alpigenum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
