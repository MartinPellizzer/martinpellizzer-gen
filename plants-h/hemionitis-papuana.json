    "intro": "Hemionitis papuana, commonly known as the papuan hemionitis, is a rare fern native to the mountainous regions of New Guinea. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnately divided fronds that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Due to habitat loss, Hemionitis papuana is considered a vulnerable species with limited distribution."
