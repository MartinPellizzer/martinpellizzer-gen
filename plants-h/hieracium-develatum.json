    "intro": "Hieracium develatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium develatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
