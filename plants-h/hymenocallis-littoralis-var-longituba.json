It is a bulbous perennial that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils near the shoreline. The plant produces tall, narrow leaves and clusters of white, spider-like flowers with a distinctive yellow throat. Its adaptability to salt spray and strong winds makes it a resilient coastal species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological importance in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
