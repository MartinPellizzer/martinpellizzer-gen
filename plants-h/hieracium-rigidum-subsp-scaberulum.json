    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. scaberulum, commonly known as rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which give it a rough texture. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
