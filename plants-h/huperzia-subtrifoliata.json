    "intro": "Huperzia subtrifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaved clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophyte produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are clustered in strobila. Huperzia subtrifoliata is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its role in ecological systems and traditional medicine."
