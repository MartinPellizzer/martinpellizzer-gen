It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. The species is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
