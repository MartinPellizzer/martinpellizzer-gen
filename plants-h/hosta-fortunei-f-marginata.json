    "intro": "Hosta fortunei f. marginata, commonly known as the white-edged hosta, is a striking cultivar of the Hosta genus native to eastern Asia. This plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly dark green with distinctive white or cream-colored margins. The leaves are often variegated, adding visual interest to the plant's appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though it is primarily cultivated for its attractive foliage."
