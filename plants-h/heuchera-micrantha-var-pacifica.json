    "intro": "Heuchera micrantha var. pacifica, commonly known as the Pacific alumroot, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States. It features dense, mat-forming foliage with heart-shaped leaves that vary in color from silver-green to deep red, depending on the variety and environmental conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer.
