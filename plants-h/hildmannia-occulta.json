    "intro": "Hildmannia occulta, commonly known as the hidden hildmannia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as under the canopy of dense forests. Its foliage consists of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hildmannia occulta is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
