    "intro": "Hieracium caricinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces numerous small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium caricinum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
