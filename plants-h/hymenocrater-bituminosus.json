    "intro": "Hymenocrater bituminosus, commonly known as the bituminous cup lichen, is a member of the family Parmeliaceae. It is a foliose lichen, characterized by its leaf-like thallus that is typically dark green to black in color. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship between a photosynthetic partner, usually a green alga, and a fungal partner, typically a member of the Ascomycota. It thrives in shaded, humid environments, often found on tree bark or soil surfaces. Its chemical composition includes various secondary metabolites that contribute to its distinct coloration and ecological role."
