    "intro": "Helianthus decapetalus var. scrophulariifolius, commonly known as the scarlet globemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in late summer and early fall. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that resemble those of the scrophulariaceae family, hence its varietal name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to xeriscapic gardens and native plant collections."
