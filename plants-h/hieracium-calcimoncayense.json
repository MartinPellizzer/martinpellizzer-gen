    "intro": "Hieracium calcimoncayense, commonly known as the calcareous hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in calcareous soils, often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is typically short-lived, with a mat-forming growth habit, and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
