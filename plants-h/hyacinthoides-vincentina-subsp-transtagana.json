    "intro": "Hyacinthoides vincentina subsp. transtagana, commonly known as the Trans-Tasman hyacinth orchid, is a rare and distinctive orchid species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its striking violet-blue flowers, which bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces a single, elongated flower spike. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation priority."
