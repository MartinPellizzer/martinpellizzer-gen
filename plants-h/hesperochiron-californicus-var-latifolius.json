It is characterized by its broad, oval-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces a milky sap that is toxic to many animals, including insects and mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. This variety is an important host plant for certain butterfly species, such as the painted lady."
