    "intro": "Hetaeria roseans, commonly known as the rose-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-white petals and a distinctive, fragrant floral structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments within forest understories. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the surrounding soil, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Hetaeria roseans is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
