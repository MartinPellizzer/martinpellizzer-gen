    "intro": "Hypericum mutilum var. longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, erect stems that are often branched and covered in short, glandular hairs. The leaves are lanceolate to ovate, with a smooth margin and a prominent midrib, and they are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with four petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in moist, open habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
