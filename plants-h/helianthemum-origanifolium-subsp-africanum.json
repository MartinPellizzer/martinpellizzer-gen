    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium subsp. africanum, commonly known as the African rock rose, is a succulent shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for Mediterranean and semi-arid climates."
