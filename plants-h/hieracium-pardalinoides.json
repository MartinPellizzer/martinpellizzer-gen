    "intro": "Hieracium pardalinoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped achenes as seeds. Hieracium pardalinoides is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
