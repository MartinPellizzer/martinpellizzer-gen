    "intro": "Hieracium venosum var. commutatum, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its habitat. The variation in its morphology, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure, contributes to its classification as a variant."
