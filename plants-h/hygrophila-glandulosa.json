    "intro": "Hygrophila glandulosa, commonly known as the water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and wetlands. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually violet or blue, arranged in whorled clusters along the stems. Hygrophila glandulosa is valued in aquariums and wetland restoration projects for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
