    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. valdecordatum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
