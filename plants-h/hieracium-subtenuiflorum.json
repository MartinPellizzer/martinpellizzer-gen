    "intro": "Hieracium subtenuiflorum, commonly known as slenderflower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems rise above the leaves, bearing small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence. Hieracium subtenuiflorum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
