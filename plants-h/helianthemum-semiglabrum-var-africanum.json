It is a low-growing shrub with compact, evergreen foliage and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, glandular leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The species is valued in horticulture for its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
