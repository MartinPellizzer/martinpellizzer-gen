    "intro": "Huperzia piscium, commonly known as the water huperzia, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often segmented fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Huperzia piscium is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
