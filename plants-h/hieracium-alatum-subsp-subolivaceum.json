    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. subolivaceum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, rough stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure."
