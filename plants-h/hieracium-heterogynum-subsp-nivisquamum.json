    "intro": "Hieracium heterogynum subsp. nivisquamum, commonly known as the snow-squamated hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and hairy, silver-gray foliage that helps it retain heat in cold environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
