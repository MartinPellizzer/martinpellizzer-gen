It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
