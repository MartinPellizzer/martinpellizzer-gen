    "intro": "Hieraciodes aculeata, commonly known as the prickly hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant grows primarily in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped with stiff, bristly hairs, and its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieraciodes aculeata is often found in disturbed areas and can spread readily through its seeds."
