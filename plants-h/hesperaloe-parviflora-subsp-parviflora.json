    "intro": "Hesperaloe parviflora subsp. parviflora, commonly known as the dwarf red yucca, is a succulent plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, bluish-green leaves and produces clusters of red or orange flowers during the summer months. The plant is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value. The subspecies parviflora is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth compared to other Hesperaloe species."
