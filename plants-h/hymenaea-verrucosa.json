    "intro": "Hymenaea verrucosa, commonly known as the \"sama\u00fama\" or \"Brazil nut tree,\" is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its large, rough, fissured bark and long, pendulous racemes of yellow flowers. The tree produces large, woody pods containing seeds that are the source of the edible Brazil nuts. Its leaves are alternate, pinnately compound, and often have a distinctive velvety texture. Hymenaea verrucosa is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
