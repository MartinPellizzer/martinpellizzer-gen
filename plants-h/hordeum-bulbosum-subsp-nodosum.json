It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and cylindrical, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration. The subspecies is distinguished by its nodular structures on the stems, which are a key botanical feature."
