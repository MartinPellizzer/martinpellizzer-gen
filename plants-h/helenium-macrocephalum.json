    "intro": "Helenium macrocephalum, commonly known as the giant swamp lantern, is a striking member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in wetland and swampy environments. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Helenium macrocephalum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
