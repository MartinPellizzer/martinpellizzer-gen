    "intro": "Heliamphora parva, commonly known as the miniature pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its small, tubular leaves that function as pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant's pitchers are typically green or red, with a waxy surface that aids in trapping prey. It thrives in cool, humid environments with nutrient-poor soil. Heliamphora parva is a popular species among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
