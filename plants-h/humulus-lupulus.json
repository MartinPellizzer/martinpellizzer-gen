    "intro": "Humulus lupulus, commonly known as hop, is a climbing plant belonging to the Cannabaceae family. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North America, and is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and cone-like flowers called strobiles. The plant produces a resinous compound known as lupulin, which is responsible for its bitter taste and aromatic properties. Hops are typically cultivated for use in brewing beer, where they contribute bitterness, flavor, and aroma. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
