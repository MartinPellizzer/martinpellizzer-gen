    "intro": "Hexisea cuniculata, commonly known as the rabbit's foot fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, velvety fronds that resemble rabbit feet, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread and colonize new areas. Its fronds are typically dark green and can grow up to 30 cm in length. Hexisea cuniculata is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
