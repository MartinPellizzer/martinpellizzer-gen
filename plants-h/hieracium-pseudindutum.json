    "intro": "Hieracium pseudindutum, commonly known as the false sandwort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and coastal areas. It has a low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
