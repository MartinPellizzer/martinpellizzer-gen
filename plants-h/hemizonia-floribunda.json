    "intro": "Hemizonia floribunda, commonly known as the red-flowered hemizonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-like inflorescences. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic properties. Hemizonia floribunda thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in arid environments."
