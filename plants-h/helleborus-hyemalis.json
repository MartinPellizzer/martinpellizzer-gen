    "intro": "Helleborus hyemalis, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It produces striking, waxy white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves emerge. The plant features broad, dark green, heart-shaped leaves that are glossy and leathery in texture. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and has a deep root system that helps it survive in colder climates. Helleborus hyemalis is valued in horticulture for its early blooming habit and ornamental appeal."
