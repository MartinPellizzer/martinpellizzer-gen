    "intro": "Hedysarum latebrosum, commonly known as the late-blooming peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Hedysarum latebrosum is adapted to rocky and dry habitats, often found in mountainous regions. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it ecologically valuable in soil enrichment."
