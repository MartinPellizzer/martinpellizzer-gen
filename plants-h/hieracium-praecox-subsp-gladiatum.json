    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. gladiatum, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy and often reddish in color. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. This subspecies is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
