It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a rough, hairy texture, which gives it its common name, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. It is often found in coastal areas, dry grasslands, and rocky habitats. This species is well adapted to harsh environmental conditions and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
