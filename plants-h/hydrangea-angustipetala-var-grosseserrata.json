It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces large, showy inflorescences that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to change flower color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
