    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum subsp. tapinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its low-growing habit and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
