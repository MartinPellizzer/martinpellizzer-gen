    "intro": "Hepetis tenuis, commonly known as slender liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a small, mat-forming liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like body, and it lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces via spores, which are released from specialized structures called sporophytes. Hepetis tenuis is often found in temperate regions and is an important indicator species for humid microhabitats."
