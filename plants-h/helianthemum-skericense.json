    "intro": "Helianthemum skericense, commonly known as the Sker island carnation, is a low-growing shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its coastal habitat. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found on rocky coastal cliffs. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native range."
