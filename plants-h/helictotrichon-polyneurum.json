    "intro": "Helictotrichon polyneurum, commonly known as the slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a bluish-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-bearing branches. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers, which are followed by small, dry seeds. This species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
