    "intro": "Hieracium sobrinatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
