    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. goritiense, commonly known as the Goritian hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and a more compact growth form compared to other members of the species."
