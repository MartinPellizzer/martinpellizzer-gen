    "intro": "Hedera wallichiana, commonly known as the Himalayan ivy, is a species of climbing plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves that are often shiny and have a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by bright red berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest areas. Hedera wallichiana is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in its native habitat."
