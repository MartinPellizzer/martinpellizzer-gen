    "intro": "Heracleum, commonly known as cow parsley or giant hogweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white or greenish-yellow flowers. The leaves are typically large, deeply lobed, and have a distinct, often aromatic scent. Heracleum species are native to temperate regions of Europe, Asia, and North America. Some species, like Heracleum mantegazzii, are considered invasive and can pose a risk due to their toxic sap."
