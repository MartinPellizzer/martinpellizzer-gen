    "intro": "Hieracium macdonaldii, commonly known as MacDonald's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, herbaceous stems that bear the inflorescence at the top. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
