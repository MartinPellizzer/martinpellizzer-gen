    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pusilla, commonly known as the small water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has delicate, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. It spreads through runners and can form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Hydrocotyle pusilla is often found in temperate regions and is adaptable to a range of water conditions."
