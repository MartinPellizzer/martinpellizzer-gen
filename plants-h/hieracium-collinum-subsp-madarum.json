It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It has a taproot system and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
