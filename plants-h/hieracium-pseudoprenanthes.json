    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoprenanthes, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize open areas."
