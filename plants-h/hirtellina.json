    "intro": "Hirtellina, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its thick, velvety leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellowish in color. Hirtellina is often found in wetlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in moist, rich soils. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
