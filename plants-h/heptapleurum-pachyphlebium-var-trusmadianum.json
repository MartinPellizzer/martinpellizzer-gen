    "intro": "Heptapleurum pachyphlebium var. trusmadianum, commonly known as the Trusmadian holly, is a rare and endemic plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, elliptical leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers followed by dark, glossy berries. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
