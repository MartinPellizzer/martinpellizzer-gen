    "intro": "Herminium lanceum, commonly known as the lance-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and its lack of chlorophyll, making it a myco-heterotroph, relying on fungal associations for nutrition. The plant produces a single, erect spike of small, greenish-white flowers, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its specialized ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
