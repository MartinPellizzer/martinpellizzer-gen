    "intro": "Hieracium suppressum, commonly known as the suppressed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
