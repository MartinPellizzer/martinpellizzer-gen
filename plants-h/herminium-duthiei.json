    "intro": "Herminium duthiei, commonly known as the Duthie's orchid, is a rare and elegant member of the orchid family, native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and delicate, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded woodlands or on rocky slopes. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a subtle beauty to its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Herminium duthiei is considered a conservation concern."
