    "intro": "Haplopappus lanuginosus, commonly known as the hairy pappus plant, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters, and it produces fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Haplopappus lanuginosus is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a common sight in desert and semi-arid regions."
