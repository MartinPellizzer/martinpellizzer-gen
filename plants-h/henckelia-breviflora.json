    "intro": "Henckelia breviflora, commonly known as the short-flowered henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. Its leaves are usually basal and pinnately divided, while the flowers are small and white or pale green. Henckelia breviflora is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to its alpine habitat."
