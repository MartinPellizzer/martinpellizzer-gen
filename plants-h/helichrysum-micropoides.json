It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Helichrysum micropoides thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ability to retain color when dried makes it a popular choice for floral arrangements."
