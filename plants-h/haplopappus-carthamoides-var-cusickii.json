    "intro": "Haplopappus carthamoides var. cusickii, commonly known as the Cusick's hairy fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its yellow-orange flower heads bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
