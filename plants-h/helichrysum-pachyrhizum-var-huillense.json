    "intro": "Helichrysum pachyrhizum var. huillense, commonly known as the Huill\u00e9n goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small sunflowers, which are often used in floral arrangements. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky soils, thriving in temperate to cold climates. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, herbaceous stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
