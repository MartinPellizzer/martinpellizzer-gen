    "intro": "Heterotrichum octonum, commonly known as the eight-branch moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and dark green, densely packed leaves. The leaves are linear to lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin, and are often twisted when dry. This moss is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rock crevices. It reproduces via spores and is well adapted to survive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
