    "intro": "Hydrocharis salifera, commonly known as the water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to the Americas. It has broad, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom above the water, typically in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Hydrocharis salifera plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
