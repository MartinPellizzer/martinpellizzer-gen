    "intro": "Hibiscus lambertianus, commonly known as Lambert's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its stems are woody and can grow up to several feet in height. Hibiscus lambertianus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, particularly insects and birds."
