    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobenzianum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. Hieracium pseudobenzianum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to spread rapidly."
