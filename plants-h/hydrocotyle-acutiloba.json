    "intro": "Hydrocotyle acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with the upper surface often exposed to sunlight. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots help stabilize aquatic sediments. Hydrocotyle acutiloba is adapted to shallow water and can thrive in both still and flowing water bodies. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
