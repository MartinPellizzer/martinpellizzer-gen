    "intro": "Hyparrhenia pseudocymbaria, commonly known as the narrow-leaf muhly, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that are often pink or red in color. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species. Its botanical features make it useful for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
