    "intro": "Habenaria tahitensis, commonly known as the Tahitian butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Pacific Islands, particularly Tahiti and other French Polynesian islands. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, butterfly-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are grass-like and arranged in a rosette, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. The species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
