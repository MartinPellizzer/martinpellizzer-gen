    "intro": "Haworthia affinis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, often marked with distinctive white or yellow markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. It produces small, pale green or white flowers on tall stems during the warmer months. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
