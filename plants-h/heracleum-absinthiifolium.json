    "intro": "Heracleum absinthiifolium, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to North America. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves with finely divided, fern-like lobes that are often covered in a fuzzy layer of hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks."
