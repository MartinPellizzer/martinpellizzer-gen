    "intro": "Hypericum cyclosepalum var. elbrusense, commonly known as the Elbrus hypericum, is a rare and endemic species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus Mountains. It is a shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
