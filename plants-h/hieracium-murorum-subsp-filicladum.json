    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. filicladum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely divided, fern-like leaves, which give it its specific epithet *filicladum*. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and along stream banks. This plant is also known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
