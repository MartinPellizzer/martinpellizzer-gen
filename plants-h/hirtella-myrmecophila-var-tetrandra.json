It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, velvety appearance. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. This variety is noted for its symbiotic relationship with ants, which inhabit the specialized structures called domatia found within the plant's stems."
