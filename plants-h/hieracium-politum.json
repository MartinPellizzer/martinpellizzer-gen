    "intro": "Hieracium politum, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium politum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
