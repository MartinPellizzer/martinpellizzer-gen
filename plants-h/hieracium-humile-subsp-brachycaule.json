    "intro": "Hieracium humile subsp. brachycaule, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its short stature, with stems that are often less than 10 cm in height. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its compact form and floral structure, it is a distinctive member of the Asteraceae family."
