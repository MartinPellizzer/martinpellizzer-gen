    "intro": "Helictotrichon milanjianum, commonly known as the Milanjianum grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green coloration that helps it thrive in arid environments. Helictotrichon milanjianum is often found in open grasslands and along rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
