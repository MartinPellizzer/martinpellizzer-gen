    "intro": "Hedysarum ancistrocarpum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sweetvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum ancistrocarpum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it valuable for soil enrichment in ecological restoration projects."
