It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant has heart-shaped, dark green leaves and thrives in warm, humid climates with well-drained soil. Hibiscus kokio is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional Hawaiian culture. Its rapid growth and ability to bloom throughout the year make it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
