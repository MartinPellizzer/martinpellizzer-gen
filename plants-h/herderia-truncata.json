It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color and have a rough texture. The plant produces small, pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It is well adapted to arid and rocky environments, often growing on cliffs or in dry soils. Herderia truncata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
