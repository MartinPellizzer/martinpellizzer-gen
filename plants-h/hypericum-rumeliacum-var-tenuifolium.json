    "intro": "Hypericum rumeliacum var. tenuifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are linear and narrow, giving the plant its common name, and they are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. This species is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It is closely related to other Hypericum species and shares similar medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal medicine."
