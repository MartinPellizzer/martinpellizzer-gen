    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. dentatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and meadows. It has fibrous roots and produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. The leaves are usually rough and hairy, with serrated edges that give it its scientific name."
