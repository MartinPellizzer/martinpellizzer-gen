    "intro": "Hieracium sciaphilum, commonly known as the shade-loving hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across suitable habitats."
