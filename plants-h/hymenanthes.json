    "intro": "Hymenanthes, commonly known as the star anise tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Schisandraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, star-shaped fruit that is widely used in culinary and medicinal applications. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into the distinctive, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Hymenanthes is valued not only for its fruit but also for its essential oils, which are used in perfumery and traditional medicine."
