    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. morteysense, commonly known as the Cornus-leaved Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves that resemble the leaves of the cornus plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
