These plants are typically shrubs or subshrubs, characterized by their distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage. Hylococcus species are native to regions in the Mediterranean, South Africa, and parts of Asia. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking appearance and drought tolerance. The plant's ability to thrive in coastal and sandy soils makes it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
