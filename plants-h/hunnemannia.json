    "intro": "Hunnemannia, commonly known as the golden cupplant, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking yellow flowers in late summer, which are borne on tall, slender stems. Hunnemannia thrives in moist, rich soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration projects."
