It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, often with a slight pubescence. It is known for its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in modern herbal medicine."
