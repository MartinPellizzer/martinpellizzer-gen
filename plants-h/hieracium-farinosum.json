    "intro": "Hieracium farinosum, commonly known as the dusty hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant is distinguished by its finely hairy, grayish-green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species."
