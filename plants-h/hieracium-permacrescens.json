    "intro": "Hieracium permacrescens, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to heights of up to 1.5 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
