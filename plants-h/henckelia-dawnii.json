    "intro": "Henckelia dawnii, commonly known as the Dawn's Henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or forested areas, and prefers cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species in botanical collections."
