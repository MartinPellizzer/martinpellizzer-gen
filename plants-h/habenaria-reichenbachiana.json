It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive greenish-yellow lip and a pale yellow to white dorsal sepal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it remains relatively rare in the wild."
