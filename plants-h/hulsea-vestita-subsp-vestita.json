    "intro": "Hulsea vestita subsp. vestita, commonly known as the slender hulsea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and maritime environments. Its leaves are linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing habitat for native insects."
