    "intro": "Hoffmannia asclepiadea, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has succulent, ribbed stems and lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its milky sap contains toxic compounds, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Hoffmannia asclepiadea plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
