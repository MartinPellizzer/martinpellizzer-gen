    "intro": "Hypericum aetnaeum, commonly known as the Aetna goldthread, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and holly-like leaves. The plant belongs to the genus Hypericum, which includes many species known for their medicinal properties. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh, high-altitude environment of its native habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority."
