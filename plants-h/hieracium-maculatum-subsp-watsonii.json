    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. watsonii, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with distinctive orange-tipped bracts. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It is part of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
