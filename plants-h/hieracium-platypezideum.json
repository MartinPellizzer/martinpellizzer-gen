    "intro": "Hieracium platypezideum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a hairy stem and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
