    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. lyratifolium, commonly known as the lyratifolium hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It has a taproot system and produces numerous flowering stems that can reach up to 30 cm in height. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more lyre-shaped leaves compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
