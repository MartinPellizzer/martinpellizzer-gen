    "intro": "Helianthemum viscarium subsp. hispidulum, commonly known as the hispid cushion crassum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, rounded leaves covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in early spring, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean environments. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
