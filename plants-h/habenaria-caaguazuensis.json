    "intro": "Habenaria caaguazuensis, commonly known as the Caaguaz\u00fa orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Paraguay. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and linear leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
