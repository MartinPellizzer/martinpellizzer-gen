It features small, rounded leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pink flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas. It has a compact growth habit, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Herniaria africana is also known for its ability to tolerate drought conditions."
