    "intro": "Haworthiopsis viscosa var. viscosa, commonly known as the Haworthia fasciata, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or silver markings. The leaves are covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or container planting due to its compact size and low maintenance requirements."
