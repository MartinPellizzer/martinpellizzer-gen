    "intro": "Haemospermum, commonly known as the bloodflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive red or orange seed pods that contain bright red or orange seeds, which give the plant its common name. The flowers are typically purple or pink and are arranged in dense clusters, often resembling a brush or a cluster of small bells. These plants are native to southern Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and they often thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Haemospermum species are known for their ornamental value and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their striking appearance."
