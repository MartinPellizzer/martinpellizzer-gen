    "intro": "Hedysarum collinum, commonly known as the mountain vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous regions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately divided, and the stems are often covered in fine hairs. Hedysarum collinum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
