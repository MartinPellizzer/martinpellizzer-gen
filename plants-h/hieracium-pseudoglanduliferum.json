It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
