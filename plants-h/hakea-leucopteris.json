    "intro": "Hakea leucopteris, commonly known as the white-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces striking, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, typically appearing in spring. It is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for low-water gardens. Hakea leucopteris is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
