The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, preferring well-drained soil and partial shade. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often found in mountainous regions across countries like Thailand and Vietnam."
