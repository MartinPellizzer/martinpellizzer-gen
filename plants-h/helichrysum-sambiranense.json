    "intro": "Helichrysum sambiranense, commonly known as the Sambiranense everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after drying. The plant typically grows in shrubland and forest edges, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, silver-white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in its native region."
