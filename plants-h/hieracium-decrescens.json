    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion decrescens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a mat-forming growth habit with creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk."
