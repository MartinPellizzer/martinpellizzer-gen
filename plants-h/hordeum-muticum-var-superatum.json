    "intro": "Hordeum muticum var. superatum, commonly known as the saltgrass or sea barley, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense, mat-forming growth pattern, which helps it thrive in saline and sandy environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are typically green or bluish-green in color. It is well-adapted to coastal dunes and salt marshes, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Hordeum muticum var. superatum is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to colonize disturbed coastal areas."
