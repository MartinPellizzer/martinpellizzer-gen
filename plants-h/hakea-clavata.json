    "intro": "Hakea clavata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it a hardy species suitable for coastal and sandy soils. Hakea clavata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
