    "intro": "Hugeria japonica f. incisa, commonly known as the Japanese fern, is a variant of the Japanese holly fern. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often bright green and slightly curled. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in partial shade."
