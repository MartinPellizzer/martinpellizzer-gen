    "intro": "Holcus argenteus, commonly known as silver hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, spikelet-based flowers. Holcus argenteus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
