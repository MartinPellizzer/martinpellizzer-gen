    "intro": "Holcus avenaceus var. palustris, commonly known as marsh bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to wetland habitats. It typically grows in moist to waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland environments and provides habitat for various invertebrates. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often used in ecological restoration projects involving wetland rehabilitation."
