    "intro": "Heteropappus insularis, commonly known as the island groundsel, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and pappus structures. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as coastal dunes and rocky areas. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by feathery seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
