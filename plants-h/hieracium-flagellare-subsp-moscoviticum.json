It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
