It features small, opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its flowers are typically borne on slender, erect stalks, and it is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Hedyotis magallanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
