    "intro": "Hedysarum ovczinnikovii, commonly known as the Ovczinnikov's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Hedysarum ovczinnikovii is often found in alpine and steppe habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
