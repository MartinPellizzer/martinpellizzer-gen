    "intro": "Henrya costata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, compact foliage with small, elliptical leaves that are typically a dark green color. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, which are followed by bright red berries. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and seasonal flowering."
