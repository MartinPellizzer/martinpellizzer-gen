    "intro": "Haworthia glauca f. armstrongii, commonly known as the Armstrong's Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of thick, fleshy, bluish-green leaves with distinctive white or pale blue markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
