    "intro": "Hakea quercifolia, commonly known as the oak-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage, with leaves that are broad, leathery, and resemble oak leaves in appearance. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to various soil types make it a resilient species in its native habitat. Hakea quercifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits in gardens and restoration projects."
