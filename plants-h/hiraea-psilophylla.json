    "intro": "Hiraea psilophylla, commonly known as the slender hiraea, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, thin leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hiraea psilophylla is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
