    "intro": "Hieracium cleistogamoides, commonly known as the cleistogamous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant is notable for producing both open and closed (cleistogamous) flowers, a reproductive strategy that ensures seed production even in shaded or disturbed environments. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its stems are erect and often branched. The plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
