    "intro": "Heliomeris hispida var. ciliata, commonly known as the hairy heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, adding ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its adaptability to drought conditions makes it a resilient choice for dryland gardens."
