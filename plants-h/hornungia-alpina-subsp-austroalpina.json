    "intro": "Hornungia alpina subsp. austroalpina, commonly known as the Alpine hornungia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense cushions or mats, which help it survive in harsh alpine conditions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, providing protection against cold and wind. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, appearing in clusters at the ends of the stems. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in high-altitude environments."
