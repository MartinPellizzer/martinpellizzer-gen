    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. hermaphroditus, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, a trait that defines its hermaphroditic nature. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in various habitats."
