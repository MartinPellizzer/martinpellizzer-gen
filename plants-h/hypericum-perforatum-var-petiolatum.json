    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. petiolatum, commonly known as the leafy St. John's wort, is a variant of the common St. John's wort. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and perforated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has a sprawling growth habit with multiple stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height. The leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have small holes, which give the plant its scientific name."
