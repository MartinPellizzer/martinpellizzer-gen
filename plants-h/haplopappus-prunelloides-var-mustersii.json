    "intro": "Haplopappus prunelloides var. mustersii, commonly known as the Musters' narrowleaf groundsel, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and ecological importance to pollinators."
