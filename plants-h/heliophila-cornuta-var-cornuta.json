It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant features slender, upright stems with small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are finely divided and often have a slight fragrance, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds."
