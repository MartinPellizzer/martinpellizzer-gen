    "intro": "Hosta decorata, commonly known as the white-veined hosta, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves with striking white veins contrasting against its deep green foliage. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches and produces small, fragrant, white flowers in late summer. Its foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for shaded gardens. Hosta decorata prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in cool, humid environments."
