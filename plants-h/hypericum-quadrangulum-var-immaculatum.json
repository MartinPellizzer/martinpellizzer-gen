It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and woodland edges.
