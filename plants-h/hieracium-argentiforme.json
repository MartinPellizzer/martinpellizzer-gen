    "intro": "Hieracium argentiforme, commonly known as silverleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it its common name, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
