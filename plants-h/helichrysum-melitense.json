    "intro": "Helichrysum melitense, commonly known as the Maltese immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is often found in coastal areas. Its small, narrow leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum melitense is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
