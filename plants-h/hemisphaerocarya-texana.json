    "intro": "Hemisphaerocarya texana, commonly known as the Texas hemisphaerocarya, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, hemispherical flower head that resembles a small bowl or cup. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in woodland or prairie habitats. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink and bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
