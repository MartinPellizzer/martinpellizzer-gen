    "intro": "Hordeum ciliatum, commonly known as rough barley, is a species of grass native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves with fine, bristly hairs along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including disturbed soils and open fields, and is often found in the western United States. Hordeum ciliatum is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in stabilizing soil and supporting local wildlife."
