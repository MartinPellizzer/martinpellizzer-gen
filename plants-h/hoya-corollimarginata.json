    "intro": "Hoya corollimarginata, commonly known as the \"Coral Margin Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a reddish or pinkish margin. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya corollimarginata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also noted for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, making it a unique addition to any indoor garden."
