It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with white or gray markings. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-draining soil with bright, indirect light. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
