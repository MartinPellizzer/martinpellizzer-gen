It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are often floating or submerged, adapting to its aquatic environment. Hydrocotyle papilionella plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
