    "intro": "Hieracium calyculatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium calyculatum is often found in sunny locations and can sometimes form dense colonies."
