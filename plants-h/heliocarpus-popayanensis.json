    "intro": "Heliocarpus popayanensis, commonly known as the Popayan hibiscus, is a shrub or small tree native to South America, particularly found in Colombia and Ecuador. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its rough, bark-like fruit capsules that enclose the seeds, a feature typical of the genus Heliocarpus. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
