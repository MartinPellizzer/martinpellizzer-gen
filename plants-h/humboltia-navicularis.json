    "intro": "Humboltia navicularis, commonly known as the Navicular Humboltia, is a flowering plant species native to the coastal regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, boat-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the dry season. Humboltia navicularis thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
