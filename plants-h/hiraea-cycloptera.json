    "intro": "Hiraea cycloptera, commonly known as the spiral liverwort, is a small, terrestrial liverwort belonging to the family Ptilidiaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like thallus that often forms dense mats on moist, shaded soil or rock surfaces. The plant exhibits a distinctive spiral arrangement of its lobes, which is a key identifying feature. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Hiraea cycloptera thrives in humid environments and is often found in temperate regions with high moisture levels."
