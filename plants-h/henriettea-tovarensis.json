    "intro": "Henriettea tovarensis, commonly known as the Tovarensis bellflower, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea tovarensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
