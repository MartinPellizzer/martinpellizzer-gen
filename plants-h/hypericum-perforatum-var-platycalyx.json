    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. platycalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elliptical leaves with translucent dots that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been used historically for its purported antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects."
