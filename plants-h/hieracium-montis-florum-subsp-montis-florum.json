    "intro": "Hieracium montis-florum subsp. montis-florum, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it tolerates cold and poor soil conditions. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its flowering heads are surrounded by bracts, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in harsh mountain environments. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
