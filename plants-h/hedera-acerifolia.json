    "intro": "Hedera acerifolia, commonly known as the maple-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to China. It is characterized by its distinctive, lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its attractive foliage, it is often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
