    "intro": "Hieracium subhastulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant has serrated, narrow leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Hieracium subhastulatum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
