    "intro": "Hieracium listropheron, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium listropheron is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
