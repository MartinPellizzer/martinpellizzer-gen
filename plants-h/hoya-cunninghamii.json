    "intro": "Hoya cunninghamii, commonly known as the \"Cunningham's wax plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers, which are typically white or pale pink, bloom in clusters and are often fragrant. Hoya cunninghamii is popular as a houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
