    "intro": "Hyparrhenia coriacea, commonly known as the rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its stiff, fibrous leaves and dense, tufted growth habit, which makes it well adapted to arid and disturbed environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often forming dense mats that stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hyparrhenia coriacea is also valued for its use in livestock forage and in traditional basket weaving."
