    "intro": "Hesperis siliqua-glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular silique houstonia, is a member of the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical seed pods called siliques, which are covered in glandular hairs. Hesperis siliqua-glandulosa is native to parts of North America and thrives in moist, open habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
