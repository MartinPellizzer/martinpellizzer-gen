    "intro": "Hoya caudata, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. Hoya caudata is a climbing plant that often grows on trees or trellises, using its aerial roots to attach itself to surfaces. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
