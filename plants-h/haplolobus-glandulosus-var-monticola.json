    "intro": "Haplolobus glandulosus var. monticola, commonly known as the mountain glandular lobelia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It features upright, branched stems covered in dense, glandular hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color, arranged in spikes at the tips of the branches. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture, adapted to the harsh conditions of its mountainous habitat. This variant is noted for its resilience to cold temperatures and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
