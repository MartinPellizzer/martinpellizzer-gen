    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. approximatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are lance-shaped and often slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite flower heads, typical of the Asteraceae family, and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in temperate climates. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can pose a challenge in native ecosystems."
