    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. odorus, commonly known as the fragrant green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves and clusters of pale green to white flowers that emit a subtle, spicy fragrance. The plant is noted for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its flowers typically bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest blooming hellebores. The variety is distinguished by its stronger scent compared to other hellebore species, which is believed to attract specific pollinators."
