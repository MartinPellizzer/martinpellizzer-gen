    "intro": "Hapalostephium hieracioides, commonly known as the silverleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant features a basal rosette of silver-gray, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. Its leaves are characterized by their finely toothed edges and dense pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
