    "intro": "Hemionitis myrtillifolia, commonly known as the pink marsh fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of China. It thrives in wetland environments, often found in shallow, freshwater habitats. The plant has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are typically light green with a reddish or pinkish hue. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator of wetland health."
