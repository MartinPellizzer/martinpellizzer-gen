    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. calvescens, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and Mediterranean-style landscaping."
