    "intro": "Hauya lundellii, commonly known as the L\u00fcders' hauya, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Hauya lundellii is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
