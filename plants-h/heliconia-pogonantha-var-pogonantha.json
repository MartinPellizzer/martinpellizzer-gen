    "intro": "Heliconia pogonantha var. pogonantha, commonly known as the red-throated heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, brightly colored inflorescences. The plant features long, narrow leaves that form a rosette, with the inflorescence consisting of numerous bracts that enclose the flowers. Its vivid red and orange bracts make it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses. The flowers are typically pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
