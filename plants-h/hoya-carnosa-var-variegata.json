    "intro": "Hoya carnosa var. variegata, commonly known as the variegated wax plant, is a popular houseplant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, typically during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya carnosa var. variegata is relatively low maintenance, making it an ideal choice for both novice and experienced plant enthusiasts."
