    "intro": "Hyoscyamus, commonly known as angel's trumpet, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically yellow, orange, or red. The plants are native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and they often grow in dry, sunny environments. Hyoscyamus species are known for their toxic properties, containing alkaloids such as hyoscyamine and scopolamine. These compounds have historically been used in medicine but require careful handling due to their potent effects."
