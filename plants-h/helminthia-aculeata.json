    "intro": "Helminthia aculeata, commonly known as the spiny hellebore, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, lance-shaped leaves with prominent veins and is characterized by its spiny, erect stems. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by poisonous, red berries. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
