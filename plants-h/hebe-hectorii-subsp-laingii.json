It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or purple. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, white fuzzy layer, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. This subspecies is known for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its attractive foliage and flowering display."
