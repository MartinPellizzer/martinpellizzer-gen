    "intro": "Helleborus orientalis var. heyderi, commonly known as the Oriental hellebore, is a perennial evergreen herbaceous plant native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the winter, and its striking, nodding flowers that range in color from deep maroon to pale pink. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and prefers partial to full shade in well-drained, fertile soil. It is valued in gardens for its winter blooming habit and is often used in woodland or shade gardens. The species is also noted for its resistance to deer and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments."
