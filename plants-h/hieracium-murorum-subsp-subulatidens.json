    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subulatidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with a creeping rhizome. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate to narrowly elliptic, with a rough, hairy texture. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disk florets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and its role in local ecosystems as a food source for pollinators."
