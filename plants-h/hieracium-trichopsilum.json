It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are usually pale yellow to white, with ray florets that give it a dandelion-like appearance. Hieracium trichopsilum is often found in open habitats and is relatively hardy, though it can be invasive in some regions."
