It is characterized by its dense, branching stems that are covered in a thick layer of white, powdery bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, followed by round, fleshy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for arid environments. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
