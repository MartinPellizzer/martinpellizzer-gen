    "intro": "Hemipilia joo-iokiana, commonly known as the Joo-Iokiana orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it forms symbiotic relationships with specific mycorrhizal fungi. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
