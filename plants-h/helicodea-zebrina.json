It features long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically green with a distinctive zigzag pattern along their edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, emerging above the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Helicodea zebrina is valued in aquascaping for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
