    "intro": "Helianthemum ellipticum, commonly known as the narrowleaf sandmat, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white bloom, giving them a slightly woolly texture. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Helianthemum ellipticum is drought-tolerant and well-suited for xeriscaping due to its hardy nature."
