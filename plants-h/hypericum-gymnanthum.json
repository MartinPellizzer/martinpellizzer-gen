    "intro": "Hypericum gymnanthum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small petals and are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional herbal remedies."
