    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. dalmaticum, commonly known as the Dalmatian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, herbaceous stems that bear the showy flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
