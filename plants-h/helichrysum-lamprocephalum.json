    "intro": "Helichrysum lamprocephalum, commonly known as the goldenhead everlasting, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features wiry, branched stems and is characterized by its bright yellow, sun-like flowers that are densely packed in clusters. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, which helps in wind dispersal of its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also known for its aromatic foliage, which can be used in herbal teas and as a natural insect repellent."
