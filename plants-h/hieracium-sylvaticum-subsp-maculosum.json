    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. maculosum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with hairy surfaces, and produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is characterized by the presence of reddish-brown markings on the leaves and stems. The subspecies is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
