    "intro": "Hugonia integerrima, commonly known as the narrow-leafed water plantain, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It features slender, cylindrical stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often coated with a waxy layer, helping to reduce water loss in its moist habitat. Hugonia integerrima is valued for its ecological role in water filtration and as a habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
