    "intro": "Hodgsonia macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a thick, hairy stem that is often reddish in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are followed by oval, greenish-brown fruits. Hodgsonia macrocarpa is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it an invasive species in some regions. However, it contains phototoxic compounds that can cause severe skin irritation upon contact with sunlight, requiring caution when handling the plant."
