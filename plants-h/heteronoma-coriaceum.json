    "intro": "Heteronoma coriaceum, commonly known as the roughleaf daisy, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, leathery leaves that give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Heteronoma coriaceum is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant once established."
