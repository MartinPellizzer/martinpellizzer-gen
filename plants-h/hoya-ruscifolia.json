    "intro": "Hoya ruscifolia, commonly known as the Rosy Wreath, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. Hoya ruscifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
