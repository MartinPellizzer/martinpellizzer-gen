    "intro": "Hypericum dentiferum, commonly known as the toothed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features woody stems covered in small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow, oval-shaped, and have serrated edges, contributing to its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. The plant is notable for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that may be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
