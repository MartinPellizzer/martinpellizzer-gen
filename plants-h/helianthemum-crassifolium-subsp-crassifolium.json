    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium subsp. crassifolium, commonly known as the thick-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, rounded clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland scrub habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in xeriscaping."
