    "intro": "Hieracium neglectum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium neglectum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
