    "intro": "Hakea ulicina var. macrocarpa, commonly known as the broad-fruited hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and produces large, showy red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant's fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of the Proteaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
