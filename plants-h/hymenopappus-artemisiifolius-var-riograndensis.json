    "intro": "Hymenopappus artemisiifolius var. riograndensis, commonly known as the Rio Grande hymenopappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas and New Mexico. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and silver-green foliage, which helps it conserve water in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are surrounded by a pappus, a feathery structure that aids in wind dispersal. This variant is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
