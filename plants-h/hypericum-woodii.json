    "intro": "Hypericum woodii, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats, and its small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
