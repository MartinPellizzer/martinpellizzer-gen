    "intro": "Hesperis chenopodiifolia, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or purple flowers and silver-gray foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as cabbages and mustards. Its structure includes a low-growing rosette of leaves with a central flowering stem. Hesperis chenopodiifolia is adapted to coastal habitats through its salt tolerance and ability to retain moisture in its leaves."
