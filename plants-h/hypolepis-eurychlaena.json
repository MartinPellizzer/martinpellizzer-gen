    "intro": "Hypolepis eurychlaena, commonly known as the broad-leafed water fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are often divided into numerous small, oval-shaped pinnae. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically near water bodies such as streams and marshes. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across wetland habitats. The fronds are often used in traditional medicine and are also appreciated for their ornamental value in aquatic gardens."
