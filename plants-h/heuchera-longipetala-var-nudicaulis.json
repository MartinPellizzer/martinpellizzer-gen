    "intro": "Heuchera longipetala var. nudicaulis, commonly known as the naked-stem heuchera, is a rare and unusual variant of the heuchera genus native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and reduced foliage, giving it a distinct appearance compared to typical heucheras. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
