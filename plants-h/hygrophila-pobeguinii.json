It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, typically in the summer months. Hygrophila pobeguinii is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to provide oxygen to the water."
