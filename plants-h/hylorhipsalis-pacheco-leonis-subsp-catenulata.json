    "intro": "Hylorhipsalis pacheco-leonis subsp. catenulata, commonly known as the chain ivy, is a climbing plant native to South America. It features thin, wiry stems that allow it to trail or climb surfaces, often used in hanging baskets or as a ground cover. The leaves are small, ovate, and have a waxy texture, while the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is valued for its ability to form dense mats and its adaptability to various growing conditions."
