    "intro": "Hieracium capnoides subsp. pseudopiliferum, commonly known as the false pilose hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies is distinguished by its reduced leaf pubescence compared to the typical form. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
