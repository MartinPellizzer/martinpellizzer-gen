    "intro": "Heliotropium petraeum, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky environments in Africa and the Middle East. It is a low-growing shrub with hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. It is adapted to survive in poor soils and withstand drought conditions. Its ability to thrive in harsh environments makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
