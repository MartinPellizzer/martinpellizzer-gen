    "intro": "Hirtella thouarsiana, commonly known as the velvetleaf hirtella, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute, dry seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in warm climates."
