    "intro": "Hypolepis hispaniolica, commonly known as the Hispaniola water fern, is a species of fern native to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in dense forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, which are protected by a membranous covering. This fern plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil stabilization and providing habitat for various microorganisms."
