    "intro": "Hymenostephium, commonly known as the sacred lotus of India, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. The leaves are usually heart-shaped and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Hymenostephium species are often found in tropical and subtropical regions, growing in wetlands or along riverbanks. Their botanical significance is further enhanced by their cultural and medicinal uses in traditional practices."
