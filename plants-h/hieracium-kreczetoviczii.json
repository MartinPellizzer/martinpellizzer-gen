    "intro": "Hieracium kreczetoviczii, commonly known as the Kreczetowicz's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
