It typically grows in well-drained soils, often found in mountainous regions of Europe. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in harsh, nutrient-poor conditions. Its subspecies status reflects adaptations to specific geological and ecological niches."
