    "intro": "Hirschfeldia incana subvar. dasycarpa, commonly known as the rough-hairy hirschfeldia, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that cover its stems and leaves, giving it a rough and fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, aiding survival in dry environments. This subvariety is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities in drought-tolerant gardens."
