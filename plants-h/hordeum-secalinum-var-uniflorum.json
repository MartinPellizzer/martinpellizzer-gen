    "intro": "Hordeum secalinum var. uniflorum, commonly known as goatgrass, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and pastures. Its seeds are small and often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Hordeum secalinum var. uniflorum is also considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its competitive growth habit."
