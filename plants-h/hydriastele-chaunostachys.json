    "intro": "Hydriastele chaunostachys, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its slender, pale green stems and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant lacks true leaves and instead relies on its stems for photosynthesis, making it highly sensitive to environmental conditions. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinct, elongated shape. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, Hydriastele chaunostachys is considered critically endangered in the wild."
