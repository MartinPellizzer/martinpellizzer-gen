    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale, commonly known as Arctic peavine, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy soils in cold climates. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, consisting of three leaflets, and it has a slender, hairy stem. Hedysarum boreale plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh environment and is adapted to survive in low-temperature conditions."
