    "intro": "Hypochaeris maculata subsp. maculata, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, often in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its flowering period typically occurs from spring to early summer. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
