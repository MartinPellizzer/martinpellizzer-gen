    "intro": "Humboltia vilipensa, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central column. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Humboltia vilipensa is adapted to withstand extreme drought conditions, making it a hardy species in desert environments."
