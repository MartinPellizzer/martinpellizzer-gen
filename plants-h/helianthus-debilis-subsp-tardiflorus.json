    "intro": "Helianthus debilis subsp. tardiflorus, commonly known as the late-flowering swamp sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetlands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low, sprawling growth habit. The plant produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tight, spiny disk flowers that bloom later in the season compared to other sunflower species. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are often reddish and branched. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
