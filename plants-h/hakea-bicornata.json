    "intro": "Hakea bicornata, commonly known as the two-horned hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny, woody structure and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Hakea bicornata is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its potential use in horticulture."
