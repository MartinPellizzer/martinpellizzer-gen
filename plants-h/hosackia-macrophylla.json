    "intro": "Hosackia macrophylla, commonly known as the broadleaf milkvetch, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. It has a taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Hosackia macrophylla plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators."
