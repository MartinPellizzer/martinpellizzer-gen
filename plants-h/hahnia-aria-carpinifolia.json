    "intro": "Hahnia aria carpinifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf hahnia, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in gardens with Mediterranean climates."
