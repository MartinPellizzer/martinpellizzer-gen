    "intro": "Hedysarum argenteum, commonly known as silver peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silver-white undersides on its trifoliate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, followed by long, slender pods that contain small, elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hedysarum argenteum is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
