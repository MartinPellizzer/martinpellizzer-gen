    "intro": "Hanabusaya latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal hanabusaya, is a unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its delicate, white or pale pink flowers. The plant has a slender, upright stem with finely divided leaves that resemble those of a dill. Its flowers are arranged in umbels, typical of the Apiaceae family, and it blooms during the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hanabusaya latisepala is considered a rare and endangered species."
