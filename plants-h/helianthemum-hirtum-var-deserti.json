    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum var. deserti, commonly known as the desert hollyhock, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has silver-gray foliage with dense, woolly hairs that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rocky garden settings. The flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to ecological diversity in its native habitat."
