    "intro": "Hieracium pulmonarioides subsp. spelaeum, commonly known as the cave hawkweed, is a rare and specialized plant species adapted to subterranean environments. It is characterized by its short, compact growth form and pale green to yellowish foliage, which helps it survive in low-light conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers that are typically found in cave systems or heavily shaded areas. It thrives in humid, nutrient-poor soils and is often associated with limestone or calcareous substrates. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
