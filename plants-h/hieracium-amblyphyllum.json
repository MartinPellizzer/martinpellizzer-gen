    "intro": "Hieracium amblyphyllum, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
