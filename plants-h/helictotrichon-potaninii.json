    "intro": "Helictotrichon potaninii, commonly known as the Potanin's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny blue to violet flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in cool, temperate climates and is adapted to poor, well-drained soils. Helictotrichon potaninii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in alpine environments."
