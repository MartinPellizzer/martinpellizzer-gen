It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as marshes and ponds. The plant features floating leaves that are heart-shaped and covered in a fine layer of fine hairs. Its small white flowers appear in clusters and bloom during the warmer months. Hydrocotyle apolobambensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
