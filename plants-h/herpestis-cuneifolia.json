    "intro": "Herpestis cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed wormwood, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features slender, upright stems covered in fine, hairy hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a slightly serrated edge. Herpestis cuneifolia is often found in dry, rocky soils and is used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported digestive benefits."
