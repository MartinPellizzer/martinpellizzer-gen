    "intro": "Huperzia megastachya, commonly known as the giant huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its large, leathery, evergreen leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its sporophylls are arranged in dense, spiraled clusters along the stem, producing spores in specialized structures. Huperzia megastachya is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its resilience to environmental stress."
