    "intro": "Hirtella paraensis, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are edible. Hirtella paraensis is often found in shaded understory environments within its natural habitat."
