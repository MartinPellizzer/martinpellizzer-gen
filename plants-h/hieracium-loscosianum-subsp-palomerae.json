    "intro": "Hieracium loscosianum subsp. palomerae, commonly known as the Palomera hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange flowers and basal rosettes of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its leaf morphology and floral structure, which differ from other members of the *Hieracium* genus. It typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic plant."
