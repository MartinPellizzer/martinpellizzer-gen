    "intro": "Helminthostachys mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican orchid or the orchid of the Sierra Madre, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
