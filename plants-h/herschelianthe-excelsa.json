It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and arid landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is widely cultivated in regions with Mediterranean climates."
