    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion mokragorae, commonly known as the Mokragorain hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hieracium mokragorae is considered a vulnerable species."
