    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pauciflora, commonly known as the small-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features a rosette of smooth, heart-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist soils, often forming dense mats. Hydrocotyle pauciflora is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, with its leaves floating or submerged depending on the water level."
