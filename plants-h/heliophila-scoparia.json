    "intro": "Heliophila scoparia, commonly known as narrowleaf heliophila, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or purple, which attract various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila scoparia thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local biodiversity and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
