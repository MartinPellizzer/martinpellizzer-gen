    "intro": "Helichrysum neoachyroclinoides, commonly known as the golden everlasting or African immortelle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which are composed of many tiny, tubular florets. The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic scent and has hairy, narrow leaves that are often gray-green in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum neoachyroclinoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
