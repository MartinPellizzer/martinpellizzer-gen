    "intro": "Helictotrichon alpinum, commonly known as alpine bluegrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically forms dense, mat-like growths with narrow, bluish-gray leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and tundra habitats. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and resilience."
