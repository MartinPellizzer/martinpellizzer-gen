    "intro": "Heracleum atlanticum, commonly known as the Atlantic cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-shaped flowers. It is native to the coastal regions of the eastern United States, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive white underside, and its flowers are typically greenish-yellow in color. It is often mistaken for poison hemlock due to its similar appearance, but it lacks the toxic compounds found in that species. Heracleum atlanticum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator plant for coastal ecosystems."
