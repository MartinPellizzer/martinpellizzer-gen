    "intro": "Hieracium semileptaleum, commonly known as the slenderleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, with yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
