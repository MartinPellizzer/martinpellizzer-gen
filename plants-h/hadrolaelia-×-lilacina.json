    "intro": "Hadrolaelia \u00d7 lilacina, commonly known as the lilac orchid, is a hybrid orchid species resulting from the cross between Hadrolaelia and Laelia. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. This plant is characterized by its vibrant, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically dark green and lance-shaped, providing a striking contrast to the colorful blooms. It thrives in cool, bright conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
