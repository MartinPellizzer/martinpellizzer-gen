    "intro": "Hydrangea opuloides var. plena, commonly known as the Japanese garden hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from white to pink, blue, or purple depending on soil pH. The plant produces sterile flowers that form dense, rounded clusters, while fertile flowers are typically smaller and less conspicuous. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its foliage is dark green and turns red or orange in the fall, adding seasonal interest."
