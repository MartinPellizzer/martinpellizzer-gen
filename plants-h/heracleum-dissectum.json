    "intro": "Heracleum dissectum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It features a thick, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are large, pinnately compound with deeply lobed segments. The plant produces umbrella-like clusters of small, white to greenish-yellow flowers in late summer. Its fruit is a small, dry schizocarp with two mericarps, each containing a single seed. Cow parsnip is often found in moist meadows, streambanks, and disturbed sites, and it is known for its irritant sap that can cause skin reactions."
