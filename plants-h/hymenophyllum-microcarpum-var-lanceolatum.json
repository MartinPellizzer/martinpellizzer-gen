    "intro": "Hymenophyllum microcarpum var. lanceolatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lanceolate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sorus, which are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is notable for its unique morphology and preference for humid, shaded habitats."
