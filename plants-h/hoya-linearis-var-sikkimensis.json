    "intro": "Hoya linearis var. sikkimensis, commonly known as the Sikkim wax plant, is a species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its long, thin, waxy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This varietal is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
