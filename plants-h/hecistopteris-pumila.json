    "intro": "Hecistopteris pumila, commonly known as the small fern, is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that helps it spread and establish itself in suitable habitats. Its leaves are usually light green and may have a slight waxy sheen. Hecistopteris pumila is often found in temperate regions and is a common species in forest understories."
