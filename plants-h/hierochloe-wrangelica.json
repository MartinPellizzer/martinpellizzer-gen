    "intro": "Hierochloe wrangelica, commonly known as Wrangel's needlegrass, is a rare grass species native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, needle-like leaves. The plant thrives in cold, nutrient-poor environments, often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Its reproductive structures include small, spike-like inflorescences that produce wind-dispersed seeds. Hierochloe wrangelica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for Arctic fauna."
