    "intro": "Hieracium melaxum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has basal and upright leaves that are hairy and serrated, with yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across various habitats. Hieracium melaxum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize new areas rapidly."
