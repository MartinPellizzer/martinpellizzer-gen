    "intro": "Hakea lorea subsp. lorea, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense, cylindrical clusters. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne in cylindrical spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, exhibiting drought tolerance and fire resistance. Hakea lorea subsp. lorea is often found in sandplain and laterite soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils in its native habitat."
