    "intro": "Heterospathe muelleriana, commonly known as the Mueller's heterospathe, is a rare and striking member of the Araceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly found in the wetlands and marshy areas of Indonesia and Malaysia. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its inflorescence consists of a spadix surrounded by a colorful spathe, which is often a vibrant green or yellow. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
