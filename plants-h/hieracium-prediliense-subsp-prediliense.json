    "intro": "Hieracium prediliense subsp. prediliense, commonly known as the alpine groundsel, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-green leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its range."
