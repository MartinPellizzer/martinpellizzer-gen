It is characterized by its square, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming in spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe tetragona is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests and diseases, contributing to its widespread cultivation."
