    "intro": "Habenaria sochensis, commonly known as the Soch orchid, is a species of orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ethiopia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread gradually over time. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
