    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum subsp. vulgare, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive leaves with translucent dots, which are visible when held up to light. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides. Its medicinal properties have been widely studied, particularly for their potential in treating mild to moderate depression. The species is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
