    "intro": "Hekaterosachne elatior, commonly known as the tall false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1.5 meters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-lobed spikelets, which are often tinged with reddish hues. Hekaterosachne elatior plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
