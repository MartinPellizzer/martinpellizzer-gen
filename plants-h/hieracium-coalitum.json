    "intro": "Hieracium coalitum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
