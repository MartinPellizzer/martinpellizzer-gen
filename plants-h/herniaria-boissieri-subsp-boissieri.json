    "intro": "Herniaria boissieri subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the rock crassula, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, succulent leaves that are typically green or bluish-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
