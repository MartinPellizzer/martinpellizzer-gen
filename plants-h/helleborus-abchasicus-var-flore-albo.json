    "intro": "Helleborus abchasicus var. flore-albo, commonly known as the Caucasian white hellebore, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its large, waxy, white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette. It prefers cool, moist, and well-drained soils in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species in botanical conservation efforts."
