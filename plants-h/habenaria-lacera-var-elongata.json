    "intro": "Habenaria lacera var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated marsh helleborine, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and ecological role."
