    "intro": "Halimium ocymoides f. lasiocladum, commonly known as the woolly sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has a compact habit with hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. This succulent species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
