    "intro": "Hetaeria tokioi, commonly known as the Tokyo hetaeria, is a rare flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in partial shade. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. Due to habitat loss, Hetaeria tokioi is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
