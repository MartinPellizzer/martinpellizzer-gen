    "intro": "Hydrostachys distichophylla var. hildebrandtii, commonly known as the Hildebrandt's narrow-leaf hydrostachys, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
