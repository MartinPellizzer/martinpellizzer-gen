It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features grayish-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its name reflects its distinctive ash-gray coloration and the presence of a scaly texture on its leaves."
