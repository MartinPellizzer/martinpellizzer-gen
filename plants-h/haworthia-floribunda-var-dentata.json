    "intro": "Haworthia floribunda var. dentata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces upright, branched clusters of small, white flowers during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
