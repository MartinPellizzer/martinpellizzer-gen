    "intro": "Hieracium rotundatum, commonly known as the round-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are rounded and hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from June to September. Hieracium rotundatum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
