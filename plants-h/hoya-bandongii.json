    "intro": "Hoya bandongii, commonly known as the \"Bandung Wax Plant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces fragrant, white or pale pink blooms that are often covered in a fine, fuzzy texture. Hoya bandongii is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
