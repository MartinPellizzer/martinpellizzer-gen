    "intro": "Hakea quinquenervis, commonly known as the five-veined hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking spikes of white or pale pink flowers, which appear in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its seeds are enclosed in woody follicles that open to release the seeds, a feature common in many hakea species. Hakea quinquenervis is adapted to arid conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas."
