It typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is characterized by its robust, fleshy stems and is often found in disturbed or semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
