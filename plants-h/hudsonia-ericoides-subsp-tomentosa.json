    "intro": "Hudsonia ericoides subsp. tomentosa, commonly known as the tomentose heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires full sun to partial shade. This subspecies is well adapted to coastal climates and is often found in sandy or rocky habitats."
