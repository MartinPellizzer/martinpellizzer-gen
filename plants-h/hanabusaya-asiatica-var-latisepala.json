    "intro": "Hanabusaya asiatica var. latisepala, commonly known as the broad-sepal hanabusaya, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its unique, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant features a short, rhizomatous stem with broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. Its flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, attracting various pollinators such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
