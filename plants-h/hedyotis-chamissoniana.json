    "intro": "Hedyotis chamissoniana, commonly known as the coastal blue-eyed grass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of North America. It features small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has slender, creeping stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand salt spray and sandy soils. It thrives in moist, well-drained habitats along shorelines and is often found in dune ecosystems. Hedyotis chamissoniana plays a vital role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
