It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium boyumense is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
