    "intro": "Hieracium canipes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in open woodlands. Hieracium canipes is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
