    "intro": "Holboellia angustifolia var. minima, commonly known as the narrowleaf holboellia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. The plant has slender, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes many aromatic herbs and vegetables. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
