    "intro": "Heterotoma pringlei, commonly known as the Pringle's heterotoma, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, clustered flowers during the spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heterotoma pringlei is considered a vulnerable species."
