    "intro": "Huperzia struthioloides, commonly known as the clubmoss, is a primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its small, needle-like leaves arranged in dense, spirally whorled patterns along its erect, branching stems. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobila, which are typically found at the tips of the branches. Huperzia struthioloides thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and has historical significance in traditional medicine."
