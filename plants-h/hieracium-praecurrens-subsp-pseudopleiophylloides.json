It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with a flowering period from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to other Hieracium species."
