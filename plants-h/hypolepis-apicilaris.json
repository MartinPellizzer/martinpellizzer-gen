    "intro": "Hypolepis apicilaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf holly fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, slender fronds that are typically arranged in a loose, upright clump. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with fertile spore-bearing leaves that are usually shorter than the sterile fronds. Its foliage is often used in ornamental horticulture due to its attractive, lacy appearance. Hypolepis apicilaris thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, moist soil for optimal growth."
