    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. wahlenbergii, commonly known as Wahlenberg's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers in the summer. Its inflorescence consists of a dense array of disk flowers surrounded by a single row of ray florets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its often harsh, temperate or alpine environment."
