    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium murorum subsp. killinense, commonly known as the Killin sandhill hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Scottish Highlands. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender, hairy stems and bright yellow composite flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in open habitats such as heaths and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is of particular interest in botanical studies due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity."
