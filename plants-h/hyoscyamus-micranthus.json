    "intro": "Hyoscyamus micranthus, commonly known as the lesser henbane, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, with erect, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are palmately lobed and have a somewhat hairy texture. Hyoscyamus micranthus contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to humans and animals, though it has been used historically in medicinal and ritual contexts."
