    "intro": "Hypericum venustum, commonly known as the yellow wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Hypericum venustum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
