    "intro": "Hieracium polycampylum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, elongated seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium polycampylum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
