    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia f. aureomarginata, commonly known as the golden-margin lanceleaf hosta, is a cultivar characterized by its striking foliage. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a broad, waxy texture and a vibrant, chartreuse edge that contrasts beautifully with the deep green center. It is a shade-tolerant plant, making it ideal for woodland gardens or shaded borders. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though its ornamental value primarily comes from its foliage. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade."
