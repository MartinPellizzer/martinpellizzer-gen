    "intro": "Hydrangea serrata var. serrata, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of showy, cone-shaped flower heads that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant features serrated, ovate leaves that are dark green and provide a striking contrast to its floral displays. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators and support local biodiversity."
