    "intro": "Hamilcoa, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its tall, grass-like foliage and striking, showy inflorescences. The plant is known for its fibrous leaves, which have been traditionally used by M\u0101ori for weaving baskets and other crafts. Hamilcoa species often thrive in wet, coastal environments and are adapted to the temperate climate of New Zealand. Due to its ecological and cultural significance, it plays an important role in both the local ecosystem and indigenous heritage."
