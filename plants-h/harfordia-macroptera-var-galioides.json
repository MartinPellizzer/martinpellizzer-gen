    "intro": "Harfordia macroptera var. galioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved harfordia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in clustered inflorescences during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments. Its foliage and floral structure make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
