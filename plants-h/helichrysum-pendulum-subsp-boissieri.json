    "intro": "Helichrysum pendulum subsp. boissieri, commonly known as the hanging goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its pendulous clusters of bright yellow, sunflower-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color when dried."
