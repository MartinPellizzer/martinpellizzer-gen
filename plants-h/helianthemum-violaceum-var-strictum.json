It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it blooms in late spring to early summer. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Helianthemum violaceum."
