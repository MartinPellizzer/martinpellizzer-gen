    "intro": "Hypolepis aspidioides, commonly known as the broad-leaf hartienna, is a fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, leathery, dark green fronds that are typically divided into numerous pinnae. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in strobila, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens."
