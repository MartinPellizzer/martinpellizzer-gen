It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy, heart-shaped, and often covered in fine white hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in flat-topped clusters. It is a common weed that can form dense mats, often outcompeting native vegetation in its habitat."
