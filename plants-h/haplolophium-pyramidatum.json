    "intro": "Haplolophium pyramidatum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Haplolophium pyramidatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
