    "intro": "Helianthemum multiplex, commonly known as the evergreen sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, succulent leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to conserve water in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners in Mediterranean and coastal climates."
