    "intro": "Hieracium irregulare, commonly known as the irregular hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
