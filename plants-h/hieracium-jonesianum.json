    "intro": "Hieracium jonesianum, commonly known as Jones' hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has basal leaves that are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Its flowering period occurs in spring and summer, producing yellow flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
