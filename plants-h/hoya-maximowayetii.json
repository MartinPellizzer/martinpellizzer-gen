The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya maximowayetii is relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
