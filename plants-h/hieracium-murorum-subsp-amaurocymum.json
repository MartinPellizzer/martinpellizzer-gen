    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. amaurocymum, commonly known as the dark-centred hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that are typically yellow to orange in color. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark, often purplish central disk within the flower head, giving it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new areas."
