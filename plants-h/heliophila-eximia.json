    "intro": "Heliophila eximia, commonly known as the golden water-plantain, is a flowering plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It produces showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. It thrives in still or slow-moving water, often forming dense stands in shallow ponds and ditches. Heliophila eximia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
