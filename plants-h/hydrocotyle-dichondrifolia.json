    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dichondrifolia, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Africa. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats on the water surface or along the edges. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are usually light green and oval in shape. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered near the water's surface, and it is often used in water gardens for its ornamental value. Hydrocotyle dichondrifolia is also known for its ability to help improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
