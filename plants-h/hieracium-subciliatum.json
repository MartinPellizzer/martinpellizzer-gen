It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has small, ciliate (fringed) margins on its leaves, giving it its scientific name. Hieracium subciliatum is typically short-lived and can be invasive in certain environments."
