    "intro": "Honottia, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and evergreen leaves, often growing in shaded, moist environments. The genus includes several species, such as Honottia hirtella and Honottia multiflora, which are native to eastern North America. These plants typically have a low-growing habit and are often found in forest understories. Their botanical features make them valuable for ecological studies and horticultural interest."
