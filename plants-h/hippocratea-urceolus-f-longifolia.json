    "intro": "Hippocratea urceolus f. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved cup plant, is a variant of the cup plant species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, heart-shaped leaves that are often longer than those of the typical species. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are typically hairy and can become woody with age, while the leaves are usually sessile and arranged alternately along the stem. This form is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodland edges and stream banks."
