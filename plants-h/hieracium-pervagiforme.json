    "intro": "Hieracium pervagiforme, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Hieracium pervagiforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
