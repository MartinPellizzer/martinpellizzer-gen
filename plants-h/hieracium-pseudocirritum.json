It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It is known for its long-lasting bloom, which can persist for several weeks, making it a popular choice for dried flower arrangements. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural studies."
