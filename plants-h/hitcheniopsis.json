    "intro": "Hitcheniopsis, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in dense, light green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the warmer months, which are typically clustered at the tips of the stems. Hitcheniopsis thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for desert gardens and rockeries."
