    "intro": "Hieracium maranzae subsp. subboreale, commonly known as the subboreal hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the northern regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
