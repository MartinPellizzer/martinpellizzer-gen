    "intro": "Hieracium rutrofolium, commonly known as the red-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright red to orange-yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It is often considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
