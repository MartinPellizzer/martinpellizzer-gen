    "intro": "Halimium occidentale, commonly known as the western sandverbena, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and gray-green, hairy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. Halimium occidentale is often used in xeriscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
