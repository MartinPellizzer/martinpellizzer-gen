It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in early summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
