    "intro": "Holcus oriolis, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, pale yellowish-green blades that often have a reddish tinge. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Holcus oriolis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, dunes, and along coastal areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
