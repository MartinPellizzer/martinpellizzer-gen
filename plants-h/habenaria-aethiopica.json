    "intro": "Habenaria aethiopica, commonly known as the Ethiopian orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Africa, particularly Ethiopia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested or mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
