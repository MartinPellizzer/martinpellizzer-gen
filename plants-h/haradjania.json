    "intro": "Haradjania, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Kenya and Tanzania. The plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers that resemble orchids in structure. Haradjania species typically grow as shrubs or small trees, with lance-shaped leaves and a preference for well-drained, sandy soils. They are often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks, where they thrive in full sun to partial shade."
