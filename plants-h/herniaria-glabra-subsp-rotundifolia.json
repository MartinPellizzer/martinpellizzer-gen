    "intro": "Herniaria glabra subsp. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to sandy and coastal habitats. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It is well adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in dunes, rocky shores, and other coastal areas where it plays a role in stabilizing sand and preventing erosion."
