It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are woody and can become semi-woody with age, and it prefers well-drained soils in full sun. Hypericum origanifolium is often used in rock gardens and as a border plant due to its ornamental value and hardy nature."
