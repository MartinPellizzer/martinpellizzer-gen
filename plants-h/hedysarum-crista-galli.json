    "intro": "Hedysarum crista-galli, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and distinctive, pea-like flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind and animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Hedysarum crista-galli is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil restoration efforts."
