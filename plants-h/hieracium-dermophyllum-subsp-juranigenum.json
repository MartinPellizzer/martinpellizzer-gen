    "intro": "Hieracium dermophyllum subsp. juranigenum, commonly known as the Jurana alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is often found in mountainous areas of the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains."
