It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
