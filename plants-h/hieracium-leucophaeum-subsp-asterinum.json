    "intro": "Hieracium leucophaeum subsp. asterinum, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has pale yellow to white flowers with narrow, linear leaves. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in leaf and flower structure, compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
