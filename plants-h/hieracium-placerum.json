    "intro": "Hieracium placerum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its yellowish to reddish flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium placerum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
