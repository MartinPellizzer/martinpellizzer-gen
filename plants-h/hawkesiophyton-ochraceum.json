    "intro": "Hawkesiophyton ochraceum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, cone-like structures. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky, well-drained soils. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
