    "intro": "Hieracium ausserdorferi subsp. pseudosenile, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a composite head. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It has lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
