    "intro": "Helianthemum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture, which helps in reducing water loss. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a similar sticky coating. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas."
