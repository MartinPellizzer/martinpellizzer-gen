It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe, particularly in the Alps. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often found in alpine meadows and open slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
