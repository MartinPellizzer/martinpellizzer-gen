    "intro": "Hakea oxyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to orange, often appearing in late summer to autumn. Hakea oxyantha is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It is also known for its ability to produce large quantities of seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind."
