    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a variant of the bentgrass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its distinctive hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. It produces small, greenish-brown flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its adaptability and ornamental qualities, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens or used in ecological restoration projects."
