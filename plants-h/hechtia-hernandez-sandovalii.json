    "intro": "Hechtia hernandez-sandovalii, commonly known as the Hernandez-Sandoval hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca, where it grows in cloud forests at elevations around 1,500 meters. The plant is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating. It produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
