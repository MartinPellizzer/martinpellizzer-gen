    "intro": "Hopea obscurinerva, commonly known as the dark-veined hopea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The tree is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and elliptical leaves with prominent, dark veins. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by woody, oblong fruits. Hopea obscurinerva is valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making due to its durability and fine grain."
