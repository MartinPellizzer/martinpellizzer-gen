    "intro": "Hieracium bottnicum subsp. oribates, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with creeping stolons that help it spread across open, disturbed sites. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. This subspecies is native to northern Europe and has been introduced to other parts of the world, sometimes becoming invasive."
