It is characterized by its rosette of basal, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping growth habit with hairy stems and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
