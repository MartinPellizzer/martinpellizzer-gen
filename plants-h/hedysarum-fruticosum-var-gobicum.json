    "intro": "Hedysarum fruticosum var. gobicum, commonly known as the Gobi heddle, is a perennial shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It features small, compound leaves and produces yellow or orange pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor, sandy soils. It is often found in steppes and desert margins, contributing to soil stabilization. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species in ecological restoration projects in arid landscapes."
