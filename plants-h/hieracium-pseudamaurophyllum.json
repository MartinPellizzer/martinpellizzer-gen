The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are upright and branching. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
