    "intro": "Hieracium rohacsense subsp. bifidelliflorum, commonly known as the bifidelliflorum hawkweed, is a rare and specialized member of the sunflower family. It is characterized by its hairy, basal leaves and yellowish to orange flowers with a distinctive bifid (split) structure at the base. This subspecies is typically found in specific alpine or subalpine habitats, often in rocky or grassy areas. Its limited distribution and unique floral morphology make it an interesting subject for botanical study. Due to its rarity, it is often protected in its native regions."
