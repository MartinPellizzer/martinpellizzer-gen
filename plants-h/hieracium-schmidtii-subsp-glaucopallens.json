    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. glaucopallens, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. The plant features basal rosettes of silver-green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. Its inflorescence consists of several flower heads, each with tubular florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive glaucous (bluish-gray) leaf surfaces and its specific geographic distribution."
