    "intro": "Halopyrum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhamnaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plants typically have simple, opposite leaves and produce small, yellowish flowers that develop into small, dark berries. Halopyrum species are often found in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, grasslands, and disturbed soils. They are sometimes invasive in non-native regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to their rapid growth and prolific seed production."
