    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. triviale, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of broadly ovate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, which consist of many small tubular florets surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
