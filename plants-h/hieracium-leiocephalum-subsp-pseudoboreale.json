    "intro": "Hieracium leiocephalum subsp. pseudoboreale, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It has a taproot system and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to cool, temperate climates."
