    "intro": "Herorchis coriophora subsp. fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant marsh orchid, is a perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe. It produces showy, pale green to yellowish flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent that attracts pollinators such as bees and flies. The plant has a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and a short, erect flowering stem. It thrives in nutrient-poor, waterlogged soils and is often found in peat bogs and along the edges of ponds. The subspecies fragrans is distinguished by its stronger fragrance compared to other subspecies of Herorchis coriophora."
