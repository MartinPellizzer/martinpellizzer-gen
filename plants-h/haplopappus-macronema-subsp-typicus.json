    "intro": "Haplopappus macronema subsp. typicus, commonly known as the narrowleaf burrobrush, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, needle-like leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, terminal clusters, which are followed by small, papery bracts that give it its common name. It is adapted to thrive in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it a hardy species in harsh desert environments. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and forage for various desert wildlife species."
