    "intro": "Hieracium prolixum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. The plant produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread easily. Hieracium prolixum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native plants."
