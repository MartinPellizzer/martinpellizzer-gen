It is characterized by its drooping clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces elongated, bean-like pods containing edible seeds, which are often used in traditional cuisines. Its leaves are compound, with trifoliate or pinnate arrangements, and it thrives in well-drained soils. The weeping tamarind is valued for its ornamental appeal and has some medicinal uses in local herbal practices."
