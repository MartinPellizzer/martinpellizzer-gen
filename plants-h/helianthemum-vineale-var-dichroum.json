    "intro": "Helianthemum vineale var. dichroum, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and rocky habitats. It features small, pale green or yellowish leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its succulent stems are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant. This variety is well-suited for xeriscaping and thrives in well-drained soils with full sun exposure."
