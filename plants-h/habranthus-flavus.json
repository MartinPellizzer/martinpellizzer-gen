    "intro": "Habranthus flavus, commonly known as the yellow star-of-Bahia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 cm and prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers, though it requires careful watering to avoid root rot."
