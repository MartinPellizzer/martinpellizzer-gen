    "intro": "Hippocratea dewildemaniana, commonly known as the Dewildeman's hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the rainforests of Ecuador and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in soft, woolly hairs. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing in the understory of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
