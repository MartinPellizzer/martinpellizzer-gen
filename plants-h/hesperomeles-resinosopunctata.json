    "intro": "Hesperomeles resinosopunctata, commonly known as the resinous dot huito, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andes region of South America. It belongs to the family Elaeocarpaceae and is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and showy, white to pink flowers. The plant produces a unique resinous substance, which gives it its common name and contributes to its ecological and potential medicinal significance. It typically grows in humid, montane forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to habitat loss and limited study, it remains a relatively understudied species within its native range."
