    "intro": "Hieracium chamaenerides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
