    "intro": "Hieracium squarrosiramum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a compact cluster. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its common name reflects the hairy appearance of its foliage, which helps in distinguishing it from similar species."
