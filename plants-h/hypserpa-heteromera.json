    "intro": "Hypserpa heteromera, commonly known as the narrow-leafed lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its thin, leaf-like thallus with a distinct upper and lower surface. The upper surface is typically greenish or brownish, while the lower surface is covered in fine, white rhizines. It forms symbiotic relationships with algae, which provide the primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. This lichen is often found on tree trunks and rocks in temperate regions."
