    "intro": "Hemisiphonia, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are typically found in coastal areas, thriving in saline and brackish water environments. Hemisiphonia species are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are usually alternate, simple, and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant's adaptability to marine conditions makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
