    "intro": "Hydrocotyle himalaica, commonly known as Himalayan water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found near streams or in alpine meadows. The plant features small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Hydrocotyle himalaica is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
