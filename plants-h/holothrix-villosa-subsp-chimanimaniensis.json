    "intro": "Holothrix villosa subsp. chimanimaniensis, commonly known as the Chimanimani hollyhock, is a flowering plant native to the Chimanimani Mountains in eastern Zimbabwe. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy bracts that resemble petals, although they are modified leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the late summer and early autumn. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins and rocky habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
