    "intro": "Haplopappus undulatus, commonly known as the wavy pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with linear, grass-like leaves and produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Its botanical features make it well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found in dry slopes, gravelly soils, and disturbed areas."
