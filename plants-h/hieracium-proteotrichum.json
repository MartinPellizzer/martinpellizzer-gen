It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid environments. It features narrow, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
