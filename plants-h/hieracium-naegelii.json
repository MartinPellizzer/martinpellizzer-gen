    "intro": "Hieracium naegelii, commonly known as the Naegeli's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium naegelii is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
