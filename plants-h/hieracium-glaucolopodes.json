    "intro": "Hieracium glaucolopodes, commonly known as the blue-veined hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist meadows and grasslands. The plant's hairy stems and leaves help reduce water loss, adapting it to its often temperate and humid habitats. It is often found in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies in suitable environments."
