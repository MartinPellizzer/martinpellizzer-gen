    "intro": "Hieracium callianthum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces achenes as its seed type. Hieracium callianthum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
