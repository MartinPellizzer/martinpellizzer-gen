    "intro": "Hoya eumbeitii, commonly known as the Wandering Nurse, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces its flowers in late summer to early autumn, often in clusters that resemble a nurse's cap, hence its common name. Hoya eumbeitii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and ornamental appeal."
