    "intro": "Hypericum crenulatum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with a slightly serrated edge, and its stems are often prostrate or trailing. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Hypericum crenulatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
