    "intro": "Hieracium japonicum, commonly known as Japanese hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, forests, and along roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to reddish-brown. It is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
