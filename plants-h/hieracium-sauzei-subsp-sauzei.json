It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in its harsh alpine habitat."
