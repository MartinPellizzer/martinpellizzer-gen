    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. polyschistophyllum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of leaves, with flowering stems that bear clusters of yellow flowers. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, disc-shaped flower heads. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
