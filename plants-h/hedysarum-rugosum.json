    "intro": "Hedysarum rugosum, commonly known as the rough trefoil, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Hedysarum rugosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
