    "intro": "Humiria floribunda var. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed humiria, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. The plant produces showy, spathaceous flowers that are typically pale green or yellow, surrounded by a leaf-like bract. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests or along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
