    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. prasinescens, commonly known as the greenish hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges across parts of Europe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
