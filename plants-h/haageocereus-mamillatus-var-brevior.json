    "intro": "Haageocereus mamillatus var. brevior, commonly known as the short-stemmed night blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its short, thick stems and spiny, cylindrical ribs. The plant produces large, white, star-shaped flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to harsh, dry environments. The varietal form brevior distinguishes it by its shorter stem length compared to the typical species."
