    "intro": "Heeria rangeana, commonly known as the rock heeria, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its small, fragrant flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, round berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Heeria rangeana is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh environments."
