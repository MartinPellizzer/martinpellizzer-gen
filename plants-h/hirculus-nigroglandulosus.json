    "intro": "Hirculus nigroglandulosus, commonly known as the black glandular hirculus, is a unique species within the hirculus genus. It is characterized by its dark green foliage, which is covered in small, black glands that secrete a viscous substance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant's botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
