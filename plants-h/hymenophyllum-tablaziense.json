    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tablaziense, commonly known as the Tablazien fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its spores are released from the undersides of its leaves, which are covered in a thin, membranous layer called the indusium. This species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in the understory of dense, tropical vegetation."
