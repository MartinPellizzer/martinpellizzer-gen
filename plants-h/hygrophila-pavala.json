    "intro": "Hygrophila pavala, commonly known as water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in clusters. It is often used in water gardens and pond landscapes for its ornamental value and ability to help control algae. Hygrophila pavala is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
