    "intro": "Hydnora acharii, commonly known as the devil's nose, is a parasitic plant found primarily in southern Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host plant for nutrients, typically growing inside the stems of other plants. The plant produces a unique, odorless flower that emits a strong smell resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies for pollination. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it is often mistaken for a fungal growth due to its appearance. Hydnora acharii is a fascinating example of a plant that has evolved to thrive in a specialized ecological niche."
