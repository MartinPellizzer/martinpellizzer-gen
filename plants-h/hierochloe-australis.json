    "intro": "Hierochloe australis, commonly known as the Australian hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are typically arranged in dense clusters along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetland or riparian habitats. Hierochloe australis plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native environment."
