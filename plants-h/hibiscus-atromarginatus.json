    "intro": "Hibiscus atromarginatus, commonly known as the black-margin hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green with prominent black margins. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a deep red throat. Hibiscus atromarginatus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
