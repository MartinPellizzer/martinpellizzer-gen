    "intro": "Hieracium repandum var. subrotundum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are broadly ovate to subrotund, with a hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
