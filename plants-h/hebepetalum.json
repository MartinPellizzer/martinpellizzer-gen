    "intro": "Hebepetalum, commonly known as the mountain heath or false heath, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their shrub-like growth habit and small, often showy flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and leathery, adapted to the harsh, dry conditions of their native habitats. Hebepetalum species are often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in well-drained environments. Their flowers, which can be pink, white, or purple, are often clustered in dense inflorescences, adding ornamental value to the landscape."
