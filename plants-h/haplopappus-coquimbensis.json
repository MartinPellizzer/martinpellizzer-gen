    "intro": "Haplopappus coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its small, feathery pappus aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus coquimbensis plays a role in stabilizing desert soils and supporting local biodiversity."
