    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaf sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, yellowish-green leaves that are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean regions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in garden settings."
