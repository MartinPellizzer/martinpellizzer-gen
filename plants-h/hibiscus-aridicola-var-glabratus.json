    "intro": "Hibiscus aridicola var. glabratus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a succulent shrub native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and dark green, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom during the cooler months. It is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its leaves and stems. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in dry climates."
