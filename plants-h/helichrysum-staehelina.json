    "intro": "Helichrysum staehelina, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow or golden inflorescences that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its small, papery bracts give it a distinctive, long-lasting appearance, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements. Helichrysum staehelina is also valued for its aromatic foliage and drought-resistant properties."
