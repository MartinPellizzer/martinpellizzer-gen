It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, rough leaves, which give it its common name. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces numerous small, dandelion-like flowers. It is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
