    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 alicantinum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short pedicels. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
