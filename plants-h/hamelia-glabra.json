    "intro": "Hamelia glabra, commonly known as the smooth flamebush, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often thornless stems. The plant produces showy, tubular red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and ovate with a smooth texture, and the plant is drought-tolerant once established. Hamelia glabra is well-suited for use in native gardens and landscaping due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
