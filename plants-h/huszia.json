    "intro": "Huszia, commonly known as the common holly, is a shrub or small tree native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its spiny leaves and bright red berries that are often used in ornamental gardening. The plant belongs to the family Aquifoliaceae and is known for its evergreen foliage, which provides year-round visual interest. Huszia thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for landscaping. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, so care should be taken when planting near areas where children or pets are present."
