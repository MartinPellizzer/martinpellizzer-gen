    "intro": "Halimus australis, commonly known as the coastal dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with a fibrous root system and a branching stem that often lies prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow composite flowers that are followed by fluffy, white seed heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is adapted to salt-laden environments. Halimus australis plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
