    "intro": "Hieracium praecox subsp. portaeferreae, commonly known as the early hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, composed of many small florets arranged in a disk. It is characterized by its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
