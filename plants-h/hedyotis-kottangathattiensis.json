    "intro": "Hedyotis kottangathattiensis, commonly known as the Kottangathatti pennywort, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in cymes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
