    "intro": "Helianthocereus poco, commonly known as the little sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless plant with a compact, globular shape and produces yellow flowers that open in the morning. The plant has thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs during the warmer months, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant's ability to thrive in dry environments makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
