    "intro": "Hypericum macgregorii subsp. punctatum, commonly known as the spotted St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, branching stems that are often hairy, and its leaves are elliptical with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late summer. Its botanical interest lies in its unique subspecific characteristics, including the presence of distinct spots on the calyces. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky or well-drained soils."
