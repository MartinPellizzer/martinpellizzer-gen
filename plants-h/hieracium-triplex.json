    "intro": "Hieracium triplex, commonly known as the three-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and can be hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium triplex is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
