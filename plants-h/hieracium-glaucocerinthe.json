    "intro": "Hieracium glaucocerinthe, commonly known as the blue-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
