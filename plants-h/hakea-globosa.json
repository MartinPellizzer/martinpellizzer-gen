    "intro": "Hakea globosa, commonly known as the globular hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spherical growth form and woody stems that often bear a thick layer of resin. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense, globular inflorescences, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. Hakea globosa is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and resilient plant."
