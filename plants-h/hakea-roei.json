    "intro": "Hakea roei, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically narrow and dark green. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in shades of yellow to orange, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea roei is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance."
