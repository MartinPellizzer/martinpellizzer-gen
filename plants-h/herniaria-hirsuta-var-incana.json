    "intro": "Herniaria hirsuta var. incana, commonly known as the hairy rock crasswort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments. It features small, fleshy, greenish-gray leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or on limestone outcrops. Its succulent leaves and adaptability to harsh environments make it a notable species in botanical studies of xerophytic flora."
