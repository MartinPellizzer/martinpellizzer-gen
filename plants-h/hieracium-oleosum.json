    "intro": "Hieracium oleosum, commonly known as meadowhawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by brown, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium oleosum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas."
