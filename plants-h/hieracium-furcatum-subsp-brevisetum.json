    "intro": "Hieracium furcatum subsp. brevisetum, commonly known as the short-stalked hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has erect, branching stems with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow, forming a composite head of small florets, and it produces seeds in a fluffy, wind-dispersed form. This subspecies is characterized by its shorter petioles compared to other members of the species."
