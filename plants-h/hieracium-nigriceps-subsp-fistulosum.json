    "intro": "Hieracium nigriceps subsp. fistulosum, commonly known as the black-headed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its dark purple to black flowers are surrounded by yellow ray florets, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The subspecies fistulosum is distinguished by its elongated, tubular stems and hairy leaves."
