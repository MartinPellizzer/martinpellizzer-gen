    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. floccidorsum, commonly known as the dark hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered flower heads that bloom in late summer, and its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species. This plant is often found in open habitats and is relatively uncommon in the wild."
