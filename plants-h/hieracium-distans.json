    "intro": "Hieracium distans, commonly known as the distant hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has alternate, hairy leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its stems are usually erect and branched, with a rough texture. Hieracium distans is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
