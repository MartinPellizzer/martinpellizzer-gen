    "intro": "Helipterum uniflorum, commonly known as the single-flower helipterum, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features bright yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, showy inflorescences. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helipterum uniflorum is often found in sandy or rocky soils in coastal regions."
