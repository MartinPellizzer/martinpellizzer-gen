    "intro": "Hieracium marchesettianum subsp. huljakianum, commonly known as the Huljakianum hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, often in rocky or grassy habitats. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies is native to the Eastern Alps and is relatively rare, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
