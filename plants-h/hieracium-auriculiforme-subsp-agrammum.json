    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. agrammum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowering heads and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive heart-shaped base, while the flowers are arranged in a compact cluster. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
