    "intro": "Hieracium cretatum, commonly known as the Cretan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Crete and other parts of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as rocky soils and grasslands. It produces yellow to orange flowers with a central disc, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium cretatum is often considered a weed but can be an indicator of disturbed or nutrient-rich soils."
