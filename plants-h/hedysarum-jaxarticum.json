    "intro": "Hedysarum jaxarticum, commonly known as the alpine milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Hedysarum jaxarticum is adapted to harsh, alpine environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity in its native habitat."
