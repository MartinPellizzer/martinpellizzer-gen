    "intro": "Hemizonia pungens var. parryi, commonly known as the Parry's hemizonia, is a species of flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its woody stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its adaptability to harsh, dry environments makes it a resilient species in its native habitat. The plant's botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptations to survive in nutrient-poor soils and extreme temperature fluctuations."
