It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are usually ovate to elliptic in shape. Its flowers are tiny, white or pale yellow, and are clustered in racemes, while the fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule. Hedyotis longifolia is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
