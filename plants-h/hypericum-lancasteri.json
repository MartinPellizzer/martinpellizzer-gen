    "intro": "Hypericum lancasteri, commonly known as the Lancashire St. John's Wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, opposite leaves and produces small, bead-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grassy areas and along hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
