    "intro": "Hieracium mastrucatum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Hieracium mastrucatum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
