    "intro": "Huperzia serrata var. paucidentata, commonly known as the serrate huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves that are arranged in whorls. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. It produces spores in elongated, cylindrical sporangia that are clustered at the tips of the leaves. This variety is notable for its reduced leaf margins compared to the typical form, giving it a distinctive appearance."
