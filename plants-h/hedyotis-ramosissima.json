    "intro": "Hedyotis ramosissima, commonly known as the creeping marshweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland and marsh environments. It features slender, branched stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hedyotis ramosissima is often found in moist soils and is an important species in aquatic and riparian ecosystems."
