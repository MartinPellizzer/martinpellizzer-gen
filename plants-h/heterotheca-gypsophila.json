    "intro": "Heterotheca gypsophila, commonly known as the gypsum sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its yellow ray flowers and dark brown disk flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are gray-green and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Heterotheca gypsophila is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ecological importance to pollinators."
