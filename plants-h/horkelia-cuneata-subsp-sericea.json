    "intro": "Horkelia cuneata subsp. sericea, commonly known as the silky horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and basal rosettes of narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry meadows and open slopes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
