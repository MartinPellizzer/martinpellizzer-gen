    "intro": "Hymenopappus filifolius var. idahoensis, commonly known as the Idaho sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces delicate, pink to purple flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open habitats like sagebrush steppe. This variety is distinguished from other forms of Hymenopappus filifolius by its specific geographic distribution and slightly different leaf morphology."
