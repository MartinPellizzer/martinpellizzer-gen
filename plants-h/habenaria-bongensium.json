    "intro": "Habenaria bongensium, commonly known as the Bornean marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy areas. The plant produces tall, slender stems with lance-shaped leaves and clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its habitat. The species is notable for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity and its potential value in horticultural cultivation."
