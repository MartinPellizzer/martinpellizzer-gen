    "intro": "Hieracium illapsum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat, disc-like structure with numerous small florets. Hieracium illapsum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
