    "intro": "Hoya alba, commonly known as the white wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically light green to white in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Hoya alba is a popular houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its air-purifying properties. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and beneficial for indoor environments."
