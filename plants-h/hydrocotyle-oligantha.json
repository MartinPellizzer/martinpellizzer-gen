    "intro": "Hydrocotyle oligantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water shield, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves that are usually narrow and elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, and it has a fibrous root system adapted for aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle oligantha thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and wetlands. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine, though its botanical significance lies in its ecological role within aquatic ecosystems."
