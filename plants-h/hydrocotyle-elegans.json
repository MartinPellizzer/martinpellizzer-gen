    "intro": "Hydrocotyle elegans, commonly known as the silverleaf marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features small, round, shiny leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, with a distinctive silver or white underside. The plant produces tiny white flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by small, dark berries. It thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swales, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its delicate appearance and ecological importance, it is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
