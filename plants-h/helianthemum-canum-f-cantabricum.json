    "intro": "Helianthemum canum f. cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It thrives in rocky, coastal, and sandy soils, often found in Mediterranean climates. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs that help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
