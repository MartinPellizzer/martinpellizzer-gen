    "intro": "Huperzia horizontalis, commonly known as the staghorn fern, is a tropical epiphytic fern native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, antler-like fronds that give it its common name. The plant lacks true roots and instead absorbs moisture and nutrients through its fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. Its unique appearance and air-purifying qualities make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
