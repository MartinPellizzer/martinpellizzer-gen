    "intro": "Helenium autumnale, commonly known as the American golden rod, is a perennial plant native to North America. It is characterized by its bright orange to yellow flower heads, which are composed of numerous small, tubular florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with lance-shaped, rough-textured leaves. Its flowering period occurs in the late summer to early autumn, making it a valuable nectar source for pollinators. Helenium autumnale thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in prairies and open woodlands."
