    "intro": "Hieracium jarzabczynum, commonly known as the Jarzabczynski's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it has a rosette of basal leaves with hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late summer, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
