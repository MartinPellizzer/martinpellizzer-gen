    "intro": "Helianthemum georgicum, commonly known as the Georgian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its flowers are typically tubular, with five petals, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not widely consumed. Helianthemum georgicum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
