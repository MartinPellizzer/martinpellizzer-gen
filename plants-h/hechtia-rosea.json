    "intro": "Hechtia rosea, commonly known as the roseate hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces striking red or pink flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette. Hechtia rosea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky or limestone soils. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental gardening and botanical collections."
