    "intro": "Hepatica asiatica subsp. insularis, commonly known as the Japanese liverleaf, is a perennial herb native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically appearing in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and rocky slopes. Due to its limited geographic range, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
