    "intro": "Hieracium lintonense, commonly known as Linton's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in grasslands and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers in early summer, followed by achenes that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
