    "intro": "Holostyla, commonly known as the \"spider orchid,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their unique, spider-like appearance due to their long, slender petals and sepals. Holostyla species typically grow as terrestrial herbs, often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid or semi-arid regions. They produce small, greenish or yellowish flowers that are pollinated by insects, particularly flies and beetles. The genus is noted for its ecological significance and is often used in horticultural displays due to its striking visual appeal."
