    "intro": "Huperzia hartwegiana, commonly known as the Hartweg's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, spore-bearing strobila that form at the tips of its upright stems. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Central and South America, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Huperzia hartwegiana plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various microorganisms and small invertebrates."
