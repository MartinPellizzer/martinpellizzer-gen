    "intro": "Helianthus laciniatus, commonly known as the cutleaf sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features large, showy yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. The plant has deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 5 feet and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for both ornamental gardens and ecological restoration projects."
