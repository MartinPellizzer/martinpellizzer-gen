    "intro": "Hofmeisteria mexiae, commonly known as the Mexican hofmeisteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and have a glossy surface, while its flowers are pale yellow with prominent white veins. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hofmeisteria mexiae is considered a species of conservation concern."
