    "intro": "Hieracium chondrillifolium subsp. castellae, commonly known as the rock hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or limestone soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its region."
