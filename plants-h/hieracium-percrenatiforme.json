    "intro": "Hieracium percrenatiforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium percrenatiforme is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes."
