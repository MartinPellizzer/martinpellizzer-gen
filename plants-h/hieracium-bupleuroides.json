It is characterized by its bright blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in a single head surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is an important plant in ecological studies due to its role in pollination and soil stabilization."
