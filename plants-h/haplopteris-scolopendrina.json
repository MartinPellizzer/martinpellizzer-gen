    "intro": "Haplopteris scolopendrina, commonly known as the slender cliff fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rock faces or in moist, shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature in many fern species. Haplopteris scolopendrina is well adapted to rocky substrates and is often seen growing in coastal or mountainous regions."
