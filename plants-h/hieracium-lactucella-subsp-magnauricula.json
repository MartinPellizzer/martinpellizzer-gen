    "intro": "Hieracium lactucella subsp. magnauricula, commonly known as the giant milk thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its large, spiny leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant belongs to the Asteraceae family and is known for its latex-like sap, which is milky and can be irritating. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and sometimes considered a weed."
