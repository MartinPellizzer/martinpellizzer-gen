It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features a rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces composite flower heads that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and drought tolerance."
