    "intro": "Hechtia pueblensis, commonly known as the Pueblan hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Puebla, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant features rosettes of narrow, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. It produces striking inflorescences with colorful bracts that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
