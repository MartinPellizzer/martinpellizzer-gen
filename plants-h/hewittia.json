    "intro": "Hewittia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plants are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to yellow and orange. Hewittia species are typically small shrubs or herbs with narrow, linear leaves adapted to conserve water. They are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
