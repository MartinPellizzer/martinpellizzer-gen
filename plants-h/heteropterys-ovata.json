    "intro": "Heteropterys ovata, commonly known as the broadleaf holly or green holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some animals but toxic to humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical forests. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in warm climates."
