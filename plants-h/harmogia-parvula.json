    "intro": "Harmogia parvula, commonly known as the small harmogia, is a small annual herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. It is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
