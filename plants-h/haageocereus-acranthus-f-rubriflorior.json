    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus f. rubriflorior, commonly known as the red-flowered hedgehog cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its spineless stems and vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun conditions. Its foliage consists of fleshy, cylindrical stems that store water, allowing it to survive in drought-prone environments. Due to its striking appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in dry gardens."
