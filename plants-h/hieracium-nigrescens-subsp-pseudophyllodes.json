    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. pseudophyllodes, commonly known as the false yarrow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. This subspecies is notable for its morphological similarity to other hawkweeds, making it challenging to distinguish without careful examination."
