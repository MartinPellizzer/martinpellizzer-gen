    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. basalticum, commonly known as the basalt hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the volcanic regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often found in open habitats such as grasslands and heaths. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered with a dense layer of white to greyish hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. It is a member of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained environments."
