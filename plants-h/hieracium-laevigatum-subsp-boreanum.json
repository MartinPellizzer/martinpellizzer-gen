    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. boreanum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the northern regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, clustered flowers in the summer months. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
