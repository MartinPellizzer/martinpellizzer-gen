    "intro": "Hypolytrum multinerve, commonly known as the narrow-veined swamp lily, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features lance-shaped leaves with prominently visible parallel veins, which contribute to its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often borne on slender stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Hypolytrum multinerve is adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
