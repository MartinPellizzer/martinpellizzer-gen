    "intro": "Hieracium figuerolae, commonly known as the Corsican hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
