    "intro": "Hieracium lapidigenum, commonly known as the stone dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its scientific name reflects its association with stone-like environments, and it is a member of the sunflower family, Asteraceae. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens as an ornamental plant."
