    "intro": "Hieracium elachycyma, commonly known as the pale-centre hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves, with small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
