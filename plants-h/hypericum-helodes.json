    "intro": "Hypericum helodes, commonly known as the yellow-flowered St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and linear, somewhat hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hypericum helodes is often used in traditional medicine and is known for its phototoxic properties due to the presence of hypericin."
