    "intro": "Hieracium sylowii var. norvagorum, commonly known as the Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow disc flowers. Native to northern Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided leaves and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. It is considered a minor weed in some regions but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
