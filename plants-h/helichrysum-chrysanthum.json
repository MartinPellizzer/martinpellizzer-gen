    "intro": "Helichrysum chrysanthum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in flat-topped inflorescences. Its foliage is aromatic and covered in fine, hairy hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Helichrysum chrysanthum is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant appearance."
