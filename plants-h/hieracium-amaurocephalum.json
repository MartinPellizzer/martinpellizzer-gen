    "intro": "Hieracium amaurocephalum, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a dark, almost black central disk, giving it its distinctive appearance. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped, hairy, and arranged alternately along the stem, contributing to its robust growth habit."
