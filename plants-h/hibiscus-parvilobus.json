It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters, featuring palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, which bloom throughout the year. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by native bees and birds, and the plant is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of Hawaii.
