    "intro": "Heldreichia rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leafed heldreichia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection."
