    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. stenogymnon, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. The plant has rough, hairy stems and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a distinctive, rough texture. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced leaf structure compared to other hawkweed species, which aids in its identification."
