    "intro": "Hieracium robertsii, commonly known as Roberts' hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the United States, particularly in the eastern regions. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads consisting of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it can thrive in full sun. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Roberts' hawkweed is noted for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
