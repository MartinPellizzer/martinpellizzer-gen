    "intro": "Hemionitis cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to Cuba. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually hidden among the foliage, and it reproduces via spores rather than seeds. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
