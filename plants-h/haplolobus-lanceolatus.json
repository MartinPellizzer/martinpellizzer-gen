    "intro": "Haplolobus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate lichen, is a species of lichen that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is typically found growing on bark or stone in forested areas. The plant has a thallus that is foliose, with a leathery texture and a pale to dark green coloration. It lacks true leaves, roots, and vascular tissue, relying instead on a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. This lichen is often used in ecological studies to assess air quality due to its sensitivity to environmental pollutants."
