    "intro": "Humata perpusilla, commonly known as the dwarf mistletoe, is a parasitic plant that grows on various coniferous trees. It produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant relies on its host for nutrients and water, forming a symbiotic relationship. Its berries are bright red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Despite its parasitic nature, it plays a role in forest ecosystems by influencing tree growth and biodiversity."
