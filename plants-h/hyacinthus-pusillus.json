It produces clusters of fragrant, blue or violet flowers in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is typically found in rocky or sandy soils. It is a perennial herb that prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
