It is a succulent shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and fleshy, gray-green leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and Mediterranean climates.
