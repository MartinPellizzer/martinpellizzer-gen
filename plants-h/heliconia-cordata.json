    "intro": "Heliconia cordata, commonly known as the crimson heliconia, is a tropical plant belonging to the Heliconiaceae family. It is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are typically pollinated by birds and insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense stands in moist, shaded environments. Heliconia cordata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in landscaping in tropical regions."
