    "intro": "Helichrysum lawrencella var. davenportii, commonly known as the Davenport's everlasting flower, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are tightly packed in dense, fluffy clusters, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are particularly long-lasting when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
