    "intro": "Haplopteris microlepis, commonly known as the small-leaf maidenhair fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. Haplopteris microlepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
