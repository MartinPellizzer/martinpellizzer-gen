It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are generally basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow, often arranged in a single head. Hieracium jangajuense is noted for its resilience to harsh climates and is sometimes considered an invasive species in areas outside its native range."
