    "intro": "Hartwrightia, commonly known as the Hartwright's orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their showy, colorful flowers that often feature intricate patterns and a sweet fragrance. Hartwrightia species typically grow as epiphytes or lithophytes, attaching themselves to trees or rocks in their natural habitat. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticulturists."
