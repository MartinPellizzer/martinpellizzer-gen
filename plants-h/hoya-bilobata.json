    "intro": "Hoya bilobata, commonly known as the \"Two-Lobed Waxplant,\" is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, often with a slight waxy coating. Hoya bilobata thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
