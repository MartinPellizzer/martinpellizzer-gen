It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has finely toothed leaves and produces numerous small, disc-shaped flowers that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its native range."
