    "intro": "Hymenasplenium kenyense, commonly known as the Kenyan spleenwort, is a member of the fern family Polypodiaceae. It is a small, epiphytic or lithophytic fern that typically grows on rocks or trees in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often divided into smaller, finger-like segments. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenasplenium kenyense is native to East Africa, particularly Kenya, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
