It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are hairy and lobed, while the flowers range in color from yellow to orange, adding visual interest to the landscape. It is often considered a weed but can provide nectar for pollinators."
