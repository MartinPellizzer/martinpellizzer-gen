It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically rough and hairy, with a dark green color and a slightly lobed shape. Hieracium ingentiforme is known for its aggressive growth and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
