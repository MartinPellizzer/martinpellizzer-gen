    "intro": "Hydrocotyle ranunculifolia, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has a rosette of small, waxy, arrowhead-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in suitable habitats. Hydrocotyle ranunculifolia plays a role in stabilizing aquatic sediments and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
