It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. The subspecies effusum is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
