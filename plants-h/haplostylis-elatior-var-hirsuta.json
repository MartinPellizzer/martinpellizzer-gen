    "intro": "Haplostylis elatior var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy stinging nettle, is a variant of the stinging nettle species characterized by its dense, soft hairs covering the stems and leaves. It belongs to the Urticaceae family and is native to regions of Europe and Asia. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clustered inflorescences, and its leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. It is known for its stinging hairs, which release irritants when touched, making it a common weed in disturbed soils. This variant is often used in traditional medicine and as a food source when cooked."
