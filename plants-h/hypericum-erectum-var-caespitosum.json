    "intro": "Hypericum erectum var. caespitosum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense, prostrate stems that form a mat-like growth habit, often covering the ground with a thick layer of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are oval-shaped, glossy, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as ground cover due to its hardy nature."
