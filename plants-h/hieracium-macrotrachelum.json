    "intro": "Hieracium macrotrachelum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves and showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It is known for its aggressive growth and is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes and seeds. The plant's botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
