    "intro": "Hieracium sceletum, commonly known as the skeleton weed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in dry, disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows and along roadsides. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while the plant's name refers to its skeletal appearance due to the thin, wiry stems. It is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain insects."
