    "intro": "Hieracium oribates, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium oribates is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
