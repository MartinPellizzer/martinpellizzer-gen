It is characterized by its rosette of soft, fuzzy, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed sites. Hieracium incrassatum is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
