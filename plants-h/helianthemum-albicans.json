It features compact, upright stems covered in small, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, white, five-petaled flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or coastal environments. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and drought-tolerant plant suitable for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
