    "intro": "Hieracium aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with the stem directly supporting its yellow-orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are composite, consisting of numerous small florets arranged in a dense cluster. Hieracium aphyllum is often found in dry, sandy soils and can tolerate poor soil conditions."
