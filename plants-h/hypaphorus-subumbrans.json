    "intro": "Hypaphorus subumbrans, commonly known as the shade-loving fern, is a species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that typically grow in dense clusters. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found under the canopy of forests. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its leaves are covered in a fine, hairy texture. This fern is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
