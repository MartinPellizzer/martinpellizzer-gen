    "intro": "Heuffelia compressa, commonly known as the narrow-leaved heuffelia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly compressed. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring and summer months. Heuffelia compressa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
