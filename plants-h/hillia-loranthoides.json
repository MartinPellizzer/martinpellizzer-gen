    "intro": "Hillia loranthoides, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus Hillia, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees. It belongs to the family Viscaraceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered together. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Hillia loranthoides is found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing in humid, shaded environments."
