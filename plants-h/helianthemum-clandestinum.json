    "intro": "Helianthemum clandestinum, commonly known as the secret sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
