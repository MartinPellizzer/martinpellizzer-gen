    "intro": "Heteroderis pusilla var. khorassanica, commonly known as the Khorasan dwarf nematode, is a species of plant-parasitic nematode. It primarily infects the roots of various crops, including legumes and grasses, causing significant damage to plant growth. The nematode's life cycle involves several stages, with the infective second-stage juvenile being the primary pathogenic stage. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in soils with high organic matter content. Due to its impact on agriculture, it is a subject of ongoing research for effective management strategies."
