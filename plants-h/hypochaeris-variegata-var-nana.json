    "intro": "Hypochaeris variegata var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf mouse-ear cress, is a low-growing annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and other sunny, open areas. Its rapid growth and ability to self-seed make it a common weed in cultivated landscapes."
