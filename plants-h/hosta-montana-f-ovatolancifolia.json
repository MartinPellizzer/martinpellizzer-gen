    "intro": "Hosta montana f. ovatolancifolia, commonly known as the broad-lanceleaf hosta, is a cultivar of the Hosta plantain family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often a deep green with a silvery-blue hue on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in late summer, though it is primarily grown for its striking foliage. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained, moist soil. This variety is popular in shady garden settings due to its ornamental leaves and hardy nature."
