    "intro": "Hakea lasianthoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces distinctive yellow flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often found in heathlands and coastal areas, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens."
