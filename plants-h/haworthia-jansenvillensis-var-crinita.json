It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white to silver hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are fleshy and adapted to store water, typical of succulents. It produces small, greenish-white flowers on tall stems during the growing season. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
