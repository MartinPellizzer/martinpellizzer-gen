    "intro": "Hieracium variegatum, commonly known as the variegated hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium variegatum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
