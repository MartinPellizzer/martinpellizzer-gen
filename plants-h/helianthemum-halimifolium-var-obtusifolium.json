    "intro": "Helianthemum halimifolium var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid environments in southern Europe. It features small, pale green to yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a blunt or rounded tip, and are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or inland areas with harsh, sunny conditions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
