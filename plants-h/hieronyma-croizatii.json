It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or red, with five petals and a prominent central stigma. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are opposite in arrangement, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
