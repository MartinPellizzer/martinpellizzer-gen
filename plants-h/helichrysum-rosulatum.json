It features small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies, with tightly packed ray florets surrounding a central disc. The plant has aromatic, silvery-green foliage that is both ornamental and drought-tolerant. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or coastal landscapes. Helichrysum rosulatum is also valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
