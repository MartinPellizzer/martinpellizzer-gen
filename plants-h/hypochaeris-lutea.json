    "intro": "Hypochaeris lutea, commonly known as the common mouse-ear, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of yellow ray florets and yellow disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy, basal leaves that are spoon-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including grasslands, disturbed soils, and along roadsides, and is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily. Hypochaeris lutea is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
