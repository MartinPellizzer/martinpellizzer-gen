    "intro": "Hieracium submolybdinum, commonly known as the leadplant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive bluish-green color, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
