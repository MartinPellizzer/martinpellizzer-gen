    "intro": "Helia loranthoides, commonly known as the Indian mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that attaches to the branches of its host trees, primarily in the family Fabaceae. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on its host for water and nutrients, while producing its own carbohydrates through photosynthesis using the light it captures. The plant has small, scale-like leaves and produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that are often overlooked. Its berries are red and contain a single seed, which is dispersed by birds. Helia loranthoides is found in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, including India, where it grows in humid, shaded environments."
