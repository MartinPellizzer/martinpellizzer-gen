    "intro": "Hermione purpureocincta, commonly known as the purple-belted orchid, is a species of orchid native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which are often adorned with a distinctive purple band around the lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, thriving in the undergrowth of cloud forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for successful germination. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
