    "intro": "Hemizygia bracteosa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree with a distinctive, bell-shaped flower that ranges in color from yellow to orange. The plant has adapted to harsh environments with thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss and a deep root system for accessing groundwater. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hemizygia bracteosa is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
