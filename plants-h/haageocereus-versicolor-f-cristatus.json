    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor f. cristatus, commonly known as the cristate night blooming cereus, is a unique cactus species characterized by its distinctive crown-like growth form. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage consists of spiny, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh conditions. The varietal form 'cristatus' refers to its swollen, crest-like appearance, which is a result of a natural mutation."
