    "intro": "Haplopappus texanus, commonly known as the Texas pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, wind-dispersed seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in its propagation. The species is often found in grasslands and scrub habitats, contributing to local biodiversity."
