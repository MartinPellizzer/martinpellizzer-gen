    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. ravnanum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and has a low, spreading growth habit. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in moist or slightly shaded environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter, more compact stems compared to other hawkweed species."
