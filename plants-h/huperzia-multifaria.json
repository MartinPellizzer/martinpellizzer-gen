    "intro": "Huperzia multifaria, commonly known as the mountain huperzia, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, cushion-like clusters. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rock crevices. The plant lacks true roots and instead has rhizomes that anchor it and absorb nutrients. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it a notable species in its native habitats."
