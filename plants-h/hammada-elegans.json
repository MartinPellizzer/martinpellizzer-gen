    "intro": "Hammada elegans, commonly known as the desert broom, is a shrub native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical growth habit and small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. It is well adapted to harsh, dry environments and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Its resilience makes it a valuable plant for landscaping in xeriscapes."
