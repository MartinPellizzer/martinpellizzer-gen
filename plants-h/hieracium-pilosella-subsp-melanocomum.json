    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. melanocomum, commonly known as the black-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, dark green leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more densely hairy stems and leaves compared to other forms of Hieracium pilosella."
