    "intro": "Hierochloe odorata, commonly known as sweetgrass, is a perennial grass native to North America, particularly found in moist, well-drained soils in wetlands and along stream banks. It is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and fine, silver-green leaves that emit a sweet, honey-like scent when crushed. The plant produces small, delicate spikelets that are often used in traditional crafts and ceremonial practices by Indigenous peoples. Sweetgrass is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in cultural and ecological systems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often used in floral arrangements and as a natural air freshener."
