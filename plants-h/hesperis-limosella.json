    "intro": "Hesperis limosella, commonly known as the bog gentian, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It belongs to the family Boraginaceae and is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, fens, and marshes. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, downy coating. Hesperis limosella plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is a valuable indicator species for wetland ecosystems."
