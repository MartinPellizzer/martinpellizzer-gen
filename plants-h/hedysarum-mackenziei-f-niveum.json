    "intro": "Hedysarum mackenziei f. niveum, commonly known as the snow-flowered prickly poppy, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late summer, giving it its common name. The plant has a robust, branched stem covered in stiff, spiny hairs, which help protect it from herbivores. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, ovate leaflets, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
