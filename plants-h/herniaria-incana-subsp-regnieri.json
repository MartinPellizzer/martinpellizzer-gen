    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. regnieri, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It features succulent, hairy stems and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit, which helps it survive in harsh, dry environments. Its leaves are typically fleshy and arranged in a rosette, aiding in water retention. Herniaria incana subsp. regnieri is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes."
