    "intro": "Hosackia torreyi var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada hoary vetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its hairy, erect stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients. Its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements make it a notable species in its native range."
