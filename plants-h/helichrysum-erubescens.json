    "intro": "Helichrysum erubescens, commonly known as the red everlasting or red goldcup, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and commonly found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical name reflects its tendency to retain its color and form even after drying."
