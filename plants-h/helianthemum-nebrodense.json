    "intro": "Helianthemum nebrodense, commonly known as the Sicilian rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Helianthemum nebrodense is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
