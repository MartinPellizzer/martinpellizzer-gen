    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. tephraeum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to regions affected by volcanic activity. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in areas with high mineral content. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with showy ray florets. It is characterized by its robust growth and adaptability to harsh environments. Its botanical significance lies in its resilience and role in ecological succession following volcanic eruptions."
