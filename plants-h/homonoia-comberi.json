    "intro": "[WRONG START] Homoia comberi, commonly known as the dwarf rock daffodil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of bright yellow, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It is often used in rock gardens and alpine displays due to its compact size and ornamental value. Homonoia comberi is also noted for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions, making it a resilient choice for gardeners."
