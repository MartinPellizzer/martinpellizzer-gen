It is a perennial legume that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils and withstand harsh environmental conditions. Hedysarum dahuricum is also valued for its role in soil stabilization and as a forage plant for livestock."
