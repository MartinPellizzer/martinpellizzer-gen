    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rupestre, commonly known as the rock fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Hymenophyllum rupestre is known for its intricate spore-bearing structures, which are clustered on the underside of its leaves."
