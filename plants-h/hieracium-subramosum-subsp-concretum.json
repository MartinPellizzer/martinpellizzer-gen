    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. concretum, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a compact growth form with dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other members of the Hieracium genus. It is often found in high-altitude environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
