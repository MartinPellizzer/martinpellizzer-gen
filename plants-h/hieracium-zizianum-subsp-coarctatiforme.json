    "intro": "Hieracium zizianum subsp. coarctatiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
