    "intro": "Hedysarum sessilifolium, commonly known as the sessile-leaved milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, arranged in dense spikes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets that are sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without stalks. Hedysarum sessilifolium is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas."
