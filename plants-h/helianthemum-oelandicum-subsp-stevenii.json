It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It typically grows on rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscape designs."
