    "intro": "Hedysarum boutignyanum, commonly known as the Boutigny's sweet clover, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum boutignyanum is often found in dry, rocky soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. It plays a role in soil fixation due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it ecologically significant in certain regions."
