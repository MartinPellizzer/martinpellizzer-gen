    "intro": "Hieracium praetermissum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium praetermissum is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
