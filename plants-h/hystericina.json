    "intro": "Hystericina, commonly known as the \"mad hatter's plant,\" is a unique species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its distinctive, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental appeal. Hystericina is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor, which has led to its association with madness in historical folklore. Due to its toxic properties, it is not recommended for cultivation or consumption."
