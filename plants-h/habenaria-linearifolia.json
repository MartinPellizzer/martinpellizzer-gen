It is characterized by its linear, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is noted for its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
