    "intro": "Hoya imbricata subsp. megapollinia, commonly known as the giant pollinia hoya, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya imbricata subsp. megapollinia is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
