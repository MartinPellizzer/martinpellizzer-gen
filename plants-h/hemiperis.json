    "intro": "Hemiperis, commonly known as sweet pepperbush, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Caprifoliaceae and is characterized by its showy, fragrant white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. Its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hemiperis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
