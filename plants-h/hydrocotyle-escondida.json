    "intro": "Hydrocotyle escondida, commonly known as the hidden water shield, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of South America. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or submerged, depending on the water level. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle escondida is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
