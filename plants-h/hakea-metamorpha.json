    "intro": "Hakea metamorpha, commonly known as the variable hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous small, hard seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Hakea metamorpha is also known for its ability to form dense thickets, which can play a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat."
