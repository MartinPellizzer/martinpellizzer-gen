    "intro": "Huszia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed huszia, is a herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of eastern North America. It features slender, upright stems that are distinctly reddish in color, especially when mature. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Huszia rubricaulis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially shaded woodland environments."
