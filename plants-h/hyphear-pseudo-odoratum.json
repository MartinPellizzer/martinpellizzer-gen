It features slender, upright stems that bear lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white and pale pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is aromatic, releasing a subtle fragrance when crushed, and it is often used in traditional medicine for its purported calming properties. Hyphear pseudo-odoratum thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a suitable addition to shaded garden beds."
