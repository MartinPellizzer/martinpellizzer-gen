    "intro": "Hypericum lancifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant contains hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used traditionally for its purported anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
