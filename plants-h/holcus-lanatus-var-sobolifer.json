    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. sobolifer, commonly known as the velvet grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass species. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and soft, hairy leaves that give it a velvety texture. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny greenish-brown flowers. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its compact growth and resilience."
