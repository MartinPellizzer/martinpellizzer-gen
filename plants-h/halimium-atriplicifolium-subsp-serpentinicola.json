    "intro": "Halimium atriplicifolium subsp. serpentinicola, commonly known as the serpentine rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its small, glandular leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is adapted to grow in nutrient-poor, calcareous soils, particularly on serpentine rock formations. Its morphology reflects its specialized habitat, with compact growth and reduced leaf size. The plant plays a role in stabilizing rocky soils and supports specific insect pollinators."
