    "intro": "Hedera helix var. lobatomajor, commonly known as the giant ivy, is a vigorous climbing plant characterized by its large, lobed leaves that can reach up to 15 cm in diameter. It is a variant of the common ivy, distinguished by its more pronounced leaf lobes and robust growth habit. Native to Europe, it thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found climbing trees or walls. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered invasive in some regions and requires careful management."
