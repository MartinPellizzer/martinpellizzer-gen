    "intro": "Hydrocotyle leucocephala var. minuta, commonly known as the small white marsh mallow, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, palmate leaves that float on the water surface, giving it a delicate, lily-like appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in moist soils and shallow water. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of slow-moving streams."
