    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. glaucus, commonly known as the bluegrass meadowgrass, is a variant of the common hairgrass species. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like foliage with a distinctive blue-green hue, which is due to the presence of a waxy coating on the leaves. This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. It has a tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in maintaining soil stability in natural habitats."
