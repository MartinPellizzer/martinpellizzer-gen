    "intro": "Hemionitis stieri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of silky hair. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of its fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis stieri is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
