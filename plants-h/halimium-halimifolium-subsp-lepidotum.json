    "intro": "Halimium halimifolium subsp. lepidotum, commonly known as the silver carpet bugloss, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features silvery-gray foliage covered in fine, overlapping scales that reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers in late spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This subspecies is valued in xeriscaping for its ornamental appearance and ecological benefits."
