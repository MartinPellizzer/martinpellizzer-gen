    "intro": "Hibbertia heterotricha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Dilleniaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in coastal and inland regions. Its leaves are narrow and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Hibbertia heterotricha is often found in open forests and heathlands, where it thrives in full sun."
