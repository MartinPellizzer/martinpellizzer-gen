    "intro": "Hieracium galbeum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium galbeum is often considered a weed due to its invasive growth habits in certain regions."
