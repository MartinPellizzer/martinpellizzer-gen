    "intro": "Hymenophyllum plumieri, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are covered in fine, silvery scales, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, hairy clusters on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum plumieri is often found growing on trees or rocks in humid, tropical climates."
