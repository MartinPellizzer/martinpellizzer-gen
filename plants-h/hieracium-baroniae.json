    "intro": "Hieracium baroniae, commonly known as the Baronia hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
