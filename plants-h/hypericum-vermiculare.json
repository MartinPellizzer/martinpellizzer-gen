    "intro": "Hypericum vermiculare, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, slightly hairy leaves and produces red, berry-like fruits that mature in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
