    "intro": "Hydroglossum semipinnatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water-plantain, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond edges, and stream banks. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are usually arranged in a basal rosette, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, clustered in dense spikes, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Hydroglossum semipinnatum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
