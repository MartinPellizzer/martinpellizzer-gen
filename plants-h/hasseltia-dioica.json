It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often gland-dotted, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some animals. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous regions. The species is notable for its dioecious nature, with male and female flowers on separate plants."
