    "intro": "Hyptis nepetoides, commonly known as catnip, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which includes other aromatic herbs like mint and sage. The plant is characterized by its square stems, opposite leaves, and clusters of small, tubular flowers. It produces a distinctive scent when crushed, primarily due to the presence of nepetalactone. Hyptis nepetoides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a natural attractant for certain insects."
