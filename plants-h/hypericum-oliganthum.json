    "intro": "Hypericum oliganthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the genus Hypericum, which includes many species of flowering plants known for their yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or dry soils and is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. It blooms from June to August and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
