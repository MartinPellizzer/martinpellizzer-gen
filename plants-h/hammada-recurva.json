    "intro": "Hammada recurva, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces a milky sap, which is a common feature among plants in the milkweed family. It has adapted to harsh environments through deep root systems and waxy leaves that reduce water loss. Hammada recurva plays an important role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
