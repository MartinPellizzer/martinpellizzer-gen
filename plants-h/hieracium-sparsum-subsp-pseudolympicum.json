    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. pseudolympicum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species, particularly in leaf structure and flower arrangement. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in mountainous areas with limited vegetation."
