    "intro": "Helichrysum alleizettei, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces papery, often persistent bracts that give it a long-lasting appearance, hence its common name. It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Helichrysum alleizettei is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
