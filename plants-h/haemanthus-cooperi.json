    "intro": "Haemanthus cooperi, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright orange-red flowers, which bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette at the base. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Haemanthus cooperi is also known for its ability to produce offsets, allowing it to spread and form dense clumps over time."
