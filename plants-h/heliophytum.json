    "intro": "Heliophytum, commonly known as the sun rose, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Aizoaceae. These plants are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. Heliophytum species are characterized by their fleshy, succulent leaves and showy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are often found growing in rocky soils and are adapted to full sun exposure. Due to their unique appearance and drought tolerance, they are popular among succulent enthusiasts and gardeners in dry climates."
