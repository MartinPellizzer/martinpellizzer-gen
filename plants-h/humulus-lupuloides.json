    "intro": "Humulus lupuloides, commonly known as the Canadian hops plant, is a climbing perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant produces a resinous substance in its female flowers, which has been historically used by Indigenous peoples for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found near streams and in forested areas. Its botanical structure and chemical composition make it distinct from the more widely cultivated hops (Humulus lupulus)."
