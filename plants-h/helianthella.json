    "intro": "Helianthella, commonly known as the mountain dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are often found in alpine and rocky habitats. They typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and resemble dandelions, with ray florets surrounding a central disk. Helianthella species are generally short-lived perennial herbs that play a role in stabilizing soil in their native environments."
