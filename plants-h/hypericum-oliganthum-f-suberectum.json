    "intro": "Hypericum oliganthum f. suberectum, commonly known as the upright St. John's wort, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has woody stems that remain upright, giving it a more structured appearance compared to other St. John's wort varieties. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
