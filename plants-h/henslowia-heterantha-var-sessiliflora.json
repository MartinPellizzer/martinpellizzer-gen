    "intro": "Henslowia heterantha var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the sessile-flowered henslowia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, with sessile (stemless) petals that give it its varietal name. Its leaves are pinnately divided, contributing to its ornamental appeal in specialized gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
