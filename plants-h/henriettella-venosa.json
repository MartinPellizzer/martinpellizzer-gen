    "intro": "Henriettella venosa, commonly known as the veined henriettella, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with prominent veins, which are a distinguishing feature. Henriettella venosa thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
