    "intro": "Hieracium colorans, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and open woodlands, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium colorans is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
