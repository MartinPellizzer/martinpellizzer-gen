    "intro": "Hieracium lancifrons, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that give it its specific epithet. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing numerous seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium lancifrons is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
