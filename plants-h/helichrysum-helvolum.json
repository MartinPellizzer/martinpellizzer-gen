    "intro": "Helichrysum helvolum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow to golden-orange flowers, which are tightly packed and resemble small, compact spheres. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its foliage is typically gray-green, with hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. Helichrysum helvolum is often used in ornamental gardening and can be dried for use in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting flowers."
