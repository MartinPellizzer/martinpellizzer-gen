    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chinensis, commonly known as the Chinese water shield, is a aquatic or semiaquatic plant native to parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small white or yellowish flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots are often anchored in muddy substrates, and it can form dense mats in still or slow-moving water. Hydrocotyle chinensis is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in water gardens."
