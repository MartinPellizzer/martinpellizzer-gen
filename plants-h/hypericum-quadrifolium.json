    "intro": "Hypericum quadrifolium, commonly known as the four-leaf clover, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, clustered yellow flowers and opposite, four-leaf clover-like leaves, which give it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued for their antiseptic and antidepressant effects. Hypericum quadrifolium is also a popular ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and delicate flowers."
