    "intro": "Hypericum ciliatum var. acutifolium, commonly known as the acute-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy margins, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
