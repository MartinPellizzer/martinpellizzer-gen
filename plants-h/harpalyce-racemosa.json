    "intro": "Harpalyce racemosa, commonly known as the racemose harpalyce, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its seed pods are cylindrical and dehiscent, releasing seeds when mature. Harpalyce racemosa is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide forage for wildlife."
