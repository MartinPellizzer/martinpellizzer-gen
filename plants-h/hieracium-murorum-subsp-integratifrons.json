It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
