    "intro": "Hedysarum sipyleum, commonly known as the sweet vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in grasslands, woodlands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by small, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum sipyleum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant."
