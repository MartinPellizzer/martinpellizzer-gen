    "intro": "Hieracium viride, commonly known as green hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
