    "intro": "Hieracium commilitonum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk and surrounding ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium commilitonum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
