    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. albovittiforme, commonly known as the white-banded hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its white or pale yellow bands on the stem, which give it its common name. It is typically found in grassy areas and disturbed soils across Europe. This plant is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
