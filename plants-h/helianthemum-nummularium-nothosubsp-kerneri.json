    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium nothosubsp. kerneri, commonly known as the Kern's stonecrop, is a low-growing, mat-forming succulent native to rocky and limestone habitats in southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green in color, providing a drought-tolerant structure. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are arranged in compact clusters atop the foliage. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits characteristics that blend those of its parent species, Helianthemum nummularium and H. kerneri."
