    "intro": "Hakea ledifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces striking red or orange flower spikes in spring, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea ledifolia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal gardens. Its unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for landscaping in Mediterranean climates."
