    "intro": "Heteropterys rubiginosa f. incana, commonly known as the woolly redleaf tree, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, or pubescent, foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically elliptical or ovate, with a reddish or brownish hue when mature. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often white or pale pink, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and color."
