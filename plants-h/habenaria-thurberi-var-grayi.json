    "intro": "Habenaria thurberi var. grayi, commonly known as Gray's spider orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, spider-like flowers that are typically pale green to yellowish in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded habitats such as hardwood forests and along stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, fragrant blooms during the spring. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
