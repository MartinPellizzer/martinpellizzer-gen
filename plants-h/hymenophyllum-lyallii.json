    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lyallii, commonly known as the Lyall's spore moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. Hymenophyllum lyallii plays a significant role in forest ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
