    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. oxygonum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often sticky stems and leaves, which help in reducing water loss and deterring herbivores. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf shape and flower structure."
