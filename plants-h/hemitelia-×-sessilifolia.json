    "intro": "Hemitelia \u00d7 sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf hemitelia, is a hybrid plant species native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, red berries as fruit. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests or undergrowth."
