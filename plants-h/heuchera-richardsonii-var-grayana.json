It features upright, hairy stems that bear clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has heart-shaped, palmate leaves that are typically silver or gray-green in color, which give it its common name. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The leaves and flowers are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported astringent properties."
