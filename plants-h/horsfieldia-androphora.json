    "intro": "Horsfieldia androphora, commonly known as the Bornean orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, particularly Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are usually broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Horsfieldia androphora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by orchid enthusiasts."
