    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. albiflorum, commonly known as the white-flowered rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a delicate contrast to its gray-green foliage. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
