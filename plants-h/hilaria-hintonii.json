It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as sandhill prairies and dry woodlands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is well adapted to poor soils and drought conditions, making it a hardy species. Hilaria hintonii plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of its native habitat."
