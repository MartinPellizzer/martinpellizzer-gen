    "intro": "Harpephyllum, commonly known as the golden bush or golden broom, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, creating a striking visual display. The plant typically grows in shrub form, with woody stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Harpephyllum is native to regions of southern Africa and is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
