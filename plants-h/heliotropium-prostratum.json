    "intro": "Heliotropium prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate heliotrope, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the evening primrose. The plant has thin, spreading stems that lie close to the ground, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Heliotropium prostratum is known for its ability to spread rapidly through seeds and rhizomes, making it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed."
