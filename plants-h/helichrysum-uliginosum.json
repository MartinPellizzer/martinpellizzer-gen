    "intro": "Helichrysum uliginosum, commonly known as the marsh everlasting, is a low-growing perennial herb native to wetland environments in southern Africa. It produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are often mistaken for daisies, and its foliage is typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of water bodies. Its flowers are long-lasting and retain their color when dried, making it a popular choice for floral arrangements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional medicinal uses."
