    "intro": "Heterotheca microcephala, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments."
