    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius idubedae, commonly known as the Idubedan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
