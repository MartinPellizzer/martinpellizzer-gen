    "intro": "Hieracium ventricatum, commonly known as the swollen hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal rosettes of broadly ovate, dark green leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
