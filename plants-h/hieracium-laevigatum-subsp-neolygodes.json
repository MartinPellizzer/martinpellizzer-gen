    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. neolygodes, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has a taproot system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
