It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as steppes and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium bactiacense is a perennial herb with a hairy stem and basal leaves, often forming dense colonies in its native range."
