It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are surrounded by leaf-like bracts, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium dedovii is relatively rare and is often found in high-altitude environments, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
