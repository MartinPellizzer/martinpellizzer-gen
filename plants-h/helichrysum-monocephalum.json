    "intro": "Helichrysum monocephalum, commonly known as the single-headed everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and produces small, yellowish to golden-orange flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its foliage is aromatic, with a strong, spicy scent when crushed, and the dried flowers are often used in floral arrangements. Helichrysum monocephalum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
