It features a tall, slender trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark and a crown of large, fan-like leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by dark, spherical fruits that contain a single seed. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-resistant species. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for landscaping in tropical and subtropical regions."
