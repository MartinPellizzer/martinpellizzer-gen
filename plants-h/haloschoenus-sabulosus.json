    "intro": "Haloschoenus sabulosus, commonly known as the sand sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It thrives in sandy soils and is often found in dune environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is adapted to saline and well-drained conditions, making it an important component of coastal vegetation. Its presence indicates stable dune systems and contributes to the ecological balance of sandy shorelines."
