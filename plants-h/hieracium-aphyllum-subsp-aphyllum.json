    "intro": "Hieracium aphyllum subsp. aphyllum, commonly known as the leafless hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves, with only a rosette of bracts forming the base of the plant. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and often protected species in many regions."
