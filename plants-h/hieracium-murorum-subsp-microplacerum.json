    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. microplacerum, commonly known as the small-flowered mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and small, daisy-like yellow flowers. The subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The plant plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its specific habitat preferences and limited distribution."
