It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and a woody stem, typical of many Hypericum species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
