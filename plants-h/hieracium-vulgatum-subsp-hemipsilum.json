    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. hemipsilum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has alternate, rough-hairy leaves that are usually lance-shaped and can reach up to 10 centimeters in length. The flowers are yellow and bloom from June to August, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
