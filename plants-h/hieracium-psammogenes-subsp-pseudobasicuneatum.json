    "intro": "Hieracium psammogenes subsp. pseudobasicuneatum, commonly known as the sand dune hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Mediterranean regions. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils, often found on coastal dunes and rocky slopes. The plant has slender, erect stems with alternate leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive ray floret arrangement, and it produces small, dark seeds in a disk-like structure. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils."
