    "intro": "Hieracium arguisianum, commonly known as the Armenian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate in shape. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it thrives in rocky or sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
