    "intro": "Hedyotis capitellata var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-tipped spurge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-white flowers arranged in a single head, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its delicate appearance and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens or used in traditional herbal remedies."
