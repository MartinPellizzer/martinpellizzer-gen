    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. eriocaulon, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glandular, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a soft, woolly appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
