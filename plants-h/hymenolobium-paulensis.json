    "intro": "Hymenolobium paulensis, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and rough, fissured bark that becomes more pronounced with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody fruits containing several seeds. Hymenolobium paulensis is valued for its hard, heavy wood, which is used in construction and craftsmanship. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
