    "intro": "Hymenostegia robusta, commonly known as the robust hymenostegia, is a tropical shrub belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its sturdy, woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, which bloom in clusters along the stems. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Hymenostegia robusta is often found in moist, shaded habitats in tropical regions of South America."
