    "intro": "Hedyotis nigricans var. filifolia, commonly known as the slender bladdernut, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are white or pale green and are borne in clusters, often with a subtle fragrance. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds via wind, contributing to its natural spread in suitable habitats."
