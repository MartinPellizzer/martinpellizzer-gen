    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. spodoleucum, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers with prominent, petal-like ray florets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its white or pale yellow flowers, which contrast with the darker foliage of other Hieracium species."
