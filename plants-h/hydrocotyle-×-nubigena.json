    "intro": "Hydrocotyle \u00d7 nubigena, commonly known as the floating pennywort, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments. It features rounded, waxy leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller, submerged leaves below. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically borne in clusters. Its rapid growth rate makes it an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native plants. Botanically, it is characterized by its ability to reproduce both sexually and vegetatively, contributing to its spread and ecological impact."
