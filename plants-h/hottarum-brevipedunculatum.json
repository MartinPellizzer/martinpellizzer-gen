    "intro": "Hottarum brevipedunculatum, commonly known as the short-stemmed hottarum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered inflorescences. The plant exhibits a unique combination of morphological traits adapted to its harsh, high-altitude habitat. Its leaves are typically narrow and hairy, providing insulation against cold temperatures. Due to its limited distribution and ecological specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
