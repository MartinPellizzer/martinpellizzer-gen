    "intro": "Hieracium setigerum var. heterodoxum, commonly known as the heterodox hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative propagation and seed dispersal. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can pose a challenge in ecological restoration efforts."
