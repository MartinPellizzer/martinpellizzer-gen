    "intro": "Hutchinsia cenisia, commonly known as the Desert Daphne, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Central America. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers during the spring and early summer. The plant has small, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in its dry environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Hutchinsia cenisia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
