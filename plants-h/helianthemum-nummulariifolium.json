    "intro": "Helianthemum nummulariifolium, commonly known as the silver carpet cushion plant, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of fleshy, silver-gray leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a delicate touch of color to its foliage. It is well adapted to rocky and dry environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soil. Its compact size and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
