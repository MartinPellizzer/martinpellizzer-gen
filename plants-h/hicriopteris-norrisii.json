    "intro": "Hicriopteris norrisii, commonly known as the Norris's water fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in swampy areas, where it thrives in high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, a common feature among ferns. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hicriopteris norrisii is considered a conservation concern."
