    "intro": "Hieracium cordatum subsp. urrobensis, commonly known as the Urroben Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
