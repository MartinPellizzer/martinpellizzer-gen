    "intro": "Hieracium semilanatum, commonly known as the pale spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It features a tall, unbranched stem with spiny leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its spiny structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes protected species in certain regions."
