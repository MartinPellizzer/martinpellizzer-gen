    "intro": "Hieronymiella marginata, commonly known as the marginate hieronymiella, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a thin layer of white or grayish hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
