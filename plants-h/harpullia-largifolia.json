It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by bright red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in traditional medicine."
