It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrowly lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
