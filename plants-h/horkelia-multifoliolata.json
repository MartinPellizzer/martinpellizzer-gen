    "intro": "Horkelia multifoliolata, commonly known as the Sierra foothill dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are often deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Horkelia multifoliolata is an important plant for local pollinators and is often found in disturbed soils."
