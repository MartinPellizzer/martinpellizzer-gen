    "intro": "Hydrothrix, commonly known as the water lily, is a genus of aquatic plants belonging to the family Nychthemeral. These plants are characterized by their floating leaves and showy, often fragrant flowers that open during the day and close at night. Hydrothrix species typically have roots that anchor them in shallow water, while their leaves provide a surface for aquatic life. The flowers are usually pink, white, or yellow, and they play a role in attracting pollinators. Hydrothrix plants are widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, contributing to water ecosystems by oxygenating the water and providing habitat for various organisms."
