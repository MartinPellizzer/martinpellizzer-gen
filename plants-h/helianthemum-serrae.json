    "intro": "Helianthemum serrae, commonly known as the serrated rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, blooming from late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, thriving in full sun and drought conditions."
