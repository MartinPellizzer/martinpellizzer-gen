    "intro": "Hypolytrum glomeratum, commonly known as the clustered spike rush, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, thriving in temperate climates. The plant features dense, cylindrical clusters of small, spike-like flowers, which are usually green or brown in color. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in suitable environments. Hypolytrum glomeratum plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various microorganisms and invertebrates."
