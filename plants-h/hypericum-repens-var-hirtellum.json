    "intro": "Hypericum repens var. hirtellum, commonly known as hairy st. john's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of foliage. The leaves are oval to lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. Small, yellow flowers appear in summer, followed by red-orange berries that are attractive to birds. This variety is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils."
