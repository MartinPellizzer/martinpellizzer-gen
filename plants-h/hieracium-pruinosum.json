    "intro": "Hieracium pruinosum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy, often sticky leaves and yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough, glandular surface that gives the plant its common name. Hieracium pruinosum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
