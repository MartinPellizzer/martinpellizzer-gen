    "intro": "Hippomarathrum papillarum, commonly known as the papillate horsebean, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by legume-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
