    "intro": "Hieracium incertum, commonly known as the uncertain hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. It has a creeping growth habit, often forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats. Due to its variable morphology, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other hawkweed species."
