    "intro": "Hapalochilus jensenii, commonly known as the Jensen's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single, showy white or pale green flower. The plant is characterized by its unique floral structure, which includes a narrow, spurred labellum and a column with a distinctive shape. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on the forest floor or among mossy substrates. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
