    "intro": "Hydrotaenia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant belonging to the family Marsileaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are typically divided into four lobes, resembling a four-leaf clover. This plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Hydrotaenia ehrenbergii is often found in nutrient-rich substrates and can form dense mats on the water surface. It plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
