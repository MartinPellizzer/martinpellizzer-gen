    "intro": "Hubertia tomentosa, commonly known as the wooly hubertia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in dense, white, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
