It typically grows to a height of about 10-20 centimeters and features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or saturated ground. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local biodiversity."
