It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, silver-gray leaves with a fuzzy texture, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
