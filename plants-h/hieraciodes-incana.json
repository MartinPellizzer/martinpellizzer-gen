    "intro": "Hieraciodes incana, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its foliage is covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Hieraciodes incana is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and scrublands."
