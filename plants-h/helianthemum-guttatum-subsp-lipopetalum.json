    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum subsp. lipopetalum, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and fleshy, often succulent leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically covered in small, glandular dots, which give it the species name \"guttatum,\" meaning \"dotted.\" The subspecies lipopetalum is distinguished by its more intense flower color and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of H. guttatum."
