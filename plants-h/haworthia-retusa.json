    "intro": "Haworthia retusa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white or pale markings. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are covered in fine, white tubercles that give it its distinctive appearance. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low water requirements and ability to thrive in bright, indirect light."
