    "intro": "Hedera helix subsp. rhizomatifera, commonly known as the rhizomatous ivy, is a climbing plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often glossy and have a slightly wavy margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vigorously, making it both a useful and potentially invasive species."
