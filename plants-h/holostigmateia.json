    "intro": "Holostigmateia, commonly known as the sacred lotus of ancient Mesopotamia, is a rare and historically significant plant. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, winding stems emerging from water. The plant's leaves are broad and floating, with a waxy surface that repels water, aiding in its aquatic adaptation. Its flowers are typically pink or white, with a strong, sweet fragrance that attracts pollinators. Despite its historical importance, Holostigmateia is now considered extinct, with only fossil records and ancient texts preserving its botanical legacy."
