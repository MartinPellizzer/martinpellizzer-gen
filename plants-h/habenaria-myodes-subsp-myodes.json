    "intro": "Habenaria myodes subsp. myodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, marshy environments, often near water bodies. It has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store nutrients and water. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in bog gardens or as a houseplant."
