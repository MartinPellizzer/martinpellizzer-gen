    "intro": "Hymenolobus procumbens var. integrifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It features small, submerged leaves that form bladder-like structures to trap aquatic prey. The plant is characterized by its simple, entire leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor water conditions. Its reproductive structures are typically small and clustered, producing tiny, white flowers. The species is notable for its specialized adaptations that allow it to obtain nutrients through predation rather than traditional photosynthesis."
