    "intro": "Hordeum maritimum var. apterum, commonly known as the sea barley, is a coastal grass species native to sandy and rocky shorelines. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. This variety is adapted to withstand harsh maritime conditions, including high salinity, strong winds, and periodic inundation. Its seeds are small and produce in abundance, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing dune ecosystems. The plant plays a vital part in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
