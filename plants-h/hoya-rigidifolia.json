    "intro": "Hoya rigidifolia, commonly known as the rigid leaf hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia and Malaysia, and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its attractive, fragrant blooms. Hoya rigidifolia has a slow growth rate and is known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces. Its foliage is typically dark green with a glossy texture, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
