    "intro": "Hydrocotyle echinella, commonly known as the hairy water penny. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant features small, round, hairy leaves that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the mud. It produces tiny white flowers that bloom in late summer, and its seeds are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle echinella plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
