    "intro": "Haplopappus gossypinus, commonly known as the cottonleaf pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is notable for its soft, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open plains. Haplopappus gossypinus produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by fluffy, white seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
