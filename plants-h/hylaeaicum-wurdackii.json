It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, elongated leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical or subtropical forests. Its botanical structure includes a fibrous root system and a stem that grows close to the ground. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
