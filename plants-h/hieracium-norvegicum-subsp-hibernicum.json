    "intro": "Hieracium norvegicum subsp. hibernicum, commonly known as the Scottish hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to northern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges. The plant features erect, hairy stems with alternate, heart-shaped to ovate leaves. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oval seeds in a bract-like structure. It is often considered a weedy species due to its ability to spread rapidly in suitable environments."
