    "intro": "Hieracium benzianum subsp. subruncinatulum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, sparsely hairy stems and basal leaves that are typically lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is native to central and eastern Europe and thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadside banks. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and stem structure."
