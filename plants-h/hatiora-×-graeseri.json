    "intro": "Hatiora \u00d7 graeseri, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Hatiora and Schlumpfia species. It is native to South America, specifically Brazil, and is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that bear vibrant flowers. The plant is known for its ability to bloom during the holiday season, typically between November and January. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a zigzag pattern along the stems. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
