    "intro": "Hemiphylacus novogalicianus, commonly known as the Galician hemiphylacus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Galicia, Spain. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories or along rocky slopes. Its botanical features include fibrous roots and a short, creeping stem that supports its low-growing habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
