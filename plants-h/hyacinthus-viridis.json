It produces striking clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of green, white, and yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that emerge in early spring. Hyacinthus viridis is valued for its ornamental beauty and ability to naturalize over time."
