    "intro": "Hartogia lycopodiodes, commonly known as the Hartog's clubmoss, is a small, evergreen plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its compact, moss-like appearance with closely packed, needle-like leaves. The plant produces spores in specialized structures called strobili, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Hartogia lycopodiodes typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or rocky areas. Its simple structure and ancient lineage provide insight into the evolutionary history of early land plants."
