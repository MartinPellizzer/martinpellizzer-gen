    "intro": "Halocnemum ritterianum, commonly known as the Ritter's saltbush, is a halophytic shrub adapted to grow in saline and arid environments. It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. It is often found in coastal areas, salt marshes, and other saline soils across the Mediterranean and parts of Asia. Its ability to thrive in high-salt conditions makes it an important component of stabilizing fragile ecosystems."
