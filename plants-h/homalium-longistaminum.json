    "intro": "Homalium longistaminum, commonly known as the long-stamen hollies, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Central and South America, where it typically grows in humid lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with elongated stamens that give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and often have a glossy texture. The fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that contains a single seed, and it plays a role in the dispersal of the species by birds and mammals."
