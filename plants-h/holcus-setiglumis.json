    "intro": "Holcus setiglumis, commonly known as the slender meadow grass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along streambanks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets arranged in a panicle, with each spikelet bearing two to three small, pale green to brownish flowers. Holcus setiglumis is valued for its ecological role in supporting insect populations and its use in traditional herbal medicine."
