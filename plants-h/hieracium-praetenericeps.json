    "intro": "Hieracium praetenericeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has alternate, narrow, and often hairy leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its invasive potential, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
