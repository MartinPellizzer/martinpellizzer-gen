It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, gray-green leaves and small yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in dry meadows, rocky soils, and open woodlands. Its subspecies name, *pulverosum*, refers to the powdery texture of its leaves, which are covered in fine hairs. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
