    "intro": "Hedyotis banksii, commonly known as the New Zealand bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hedyotis banksii is often found in damp, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
