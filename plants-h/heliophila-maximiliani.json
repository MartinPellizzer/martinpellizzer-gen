    "intro": "Heliophila maximiliani, commonly known as the marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and Asia. It features slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, and its leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and ditches. Heliophila maximiliani is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
