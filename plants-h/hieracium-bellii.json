    "intro": "Hieracium bellii, commonly known as the bell-shaped hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellowish-orange flowers are surrounded by a series of small, leaf-like structures called phyllaries. Hieracium bellii is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes be invasive in non-native habitats."
