    "intro": "Helleborus purpurascens f. dniesterensis, commonly known as the Dniester hellebore, is a rare and striking plant native to the Carpathian region. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers. The plant thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found in forested areas with rich, well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after species among hellebore enthusiasts. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
