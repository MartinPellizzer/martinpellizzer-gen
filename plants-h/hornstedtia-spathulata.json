    "intro": "Hornstedtia spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leaved hornstedtia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white hairs. The plant produces striking, pale blue to violet flowers in late summer, which are arranged in a spathelate inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
