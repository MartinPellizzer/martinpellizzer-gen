    "intro": "Himantochilus comorensis, commonly known as the Comorian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Comoro Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant typically grows in humid, tropical climates with well-drained soils, often found in coastal or montane forest areas. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a glossy appearance, while its flowers are small and clustered in inflorescences. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
