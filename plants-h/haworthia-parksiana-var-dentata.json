    "intro": "Haworthia parksiana var. dentata, commonly known as the serrated Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves have a distinctive serrated or toothed margin, giving it its scientific name. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
