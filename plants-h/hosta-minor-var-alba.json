    "intro": "Hosta minor var. alba, commonly known as the white hosta, is a cultivar of the hosta plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are predominantly white in color, with a slight greenish tint at the base. This variety thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-draining soil. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though they are often less showy than the foliage. It is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance, shade-tolerant ornamental plant."
