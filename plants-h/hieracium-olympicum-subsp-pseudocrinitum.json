    "intro": "Hieracium olympicum subsp. pseudocrinitum, commonly known as the Olympic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges, and it is known for its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broadly lanceolate and covered with fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in the Olympic Peninsula, where it thrives in the region's temperate climate and nutrient-rich soils."
