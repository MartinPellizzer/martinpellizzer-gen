    "intro": "Hakea brownii, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, wiry foliage and striking, cylindrical inflorescences that produce bright yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and saline environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid climates. Hakea brownii plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native pollinators."
