    "intro": "Hexonychia, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees, characterized by their evergreen leaves and showy, tubular flowers. Hexonychia species are native to southern Africa, particularly in regions with rocky or sandy soils. They are adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, often growing on exposed rock faces or in coastal areas. The flowers, which range in color from white to pink and red, attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
