    "intro": "Hakea refracta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces spikes of bright yellow flowers in spring, which are attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry climates make it a hardy species suitable for coastal and sandy soils. Hakea refracta is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
