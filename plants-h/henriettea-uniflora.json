    "intro": "Henriettea uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive single flower that blooms in late spring. The plant produces small, delicate petals in shades of white and pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. Henriettea uniflora thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
