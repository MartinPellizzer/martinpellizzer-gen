    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. duplicatum, commonly known as the two-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and prefers full sun to partial shade. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its distinctive two-leaved structure at the base, which gives it its subspecies name. The plant is often found in temperate climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
