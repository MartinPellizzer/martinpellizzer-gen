    "intro": "Hippion aquaticum, commonly known as water horseplant, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetland environments. It has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the water surface, aiding in photosynthesis. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It is often found in shallow water areas, where its roots anchor it to the substrate. Hippion aquaticum plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
