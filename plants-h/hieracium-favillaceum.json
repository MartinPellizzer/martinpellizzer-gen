    "intro": "Hieracium favillaceum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow flower heads that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has small, bracted flower clusters that give it a distinctive appearance, and its leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs. Hieracium favillaceum is a perennial species that spreads through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions."
