    "intro": "Hypericum ericoides, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in heathlands and woodland edges. Hypericum ericoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions."
