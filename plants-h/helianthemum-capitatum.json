    "intro": "Helianthemum capitatum, commonly known as the rock rose or mountain heath, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas."
