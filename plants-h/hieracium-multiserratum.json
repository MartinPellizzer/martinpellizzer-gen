    "intro": "Hieracium multiserratum, commonly known as the multilobed hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal leaves that are lobed and often hairy, with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers are typically clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium multiserratum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
