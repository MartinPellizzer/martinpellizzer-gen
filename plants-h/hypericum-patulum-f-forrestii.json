    "intro": "Hypericum patulum f. forrestii, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It features prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground with a carpet of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are oval-shaped and have a slightly succulent texture, contributing to its drought tolerance. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
