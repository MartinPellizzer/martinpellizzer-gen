    "intro": "Hydrophyllum albifrons var. fendleri, commonly known as the desert penstemon, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with upright, branching stems that often grow in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is well-suited to xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
