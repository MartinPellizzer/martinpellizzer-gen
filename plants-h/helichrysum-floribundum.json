    "intro": "Helichrysum floribundum, commonly known as the golden daisy or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces numerous small, tubular flowers that develop into fluffy, seed-filled structures called pappus, which aid in wind pollination. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value and drought tolerance make it a favored plant in both horticulture and ecological restoration projects."
