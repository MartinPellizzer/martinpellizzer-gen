    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. pseudocaprinum, commonly known as the alpine gentian, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Gentianaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high elevations. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
