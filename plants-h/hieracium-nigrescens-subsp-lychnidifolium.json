It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy purple to reddish flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while the stems are covered in fine hairs.

It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and woodland edges."
