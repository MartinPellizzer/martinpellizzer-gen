    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. pseudopollichiae, commonly known as the Lachenal's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to other members of the species. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing in open, sunny habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range."
