    "intro": "Hieracium chamaecerinthe, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often lobed. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium chamaecerinthe is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
