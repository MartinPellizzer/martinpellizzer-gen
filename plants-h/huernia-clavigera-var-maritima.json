    "intro": "Huernia clavigera var. maritima, commonly known as the coastal horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It features a compact, branching structure with fleshy, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. This variety is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found growing in coastal dunes or rocky outcrops."
