    "intro": "Hecatactis wollastonii, commonly known as the Woolly Star, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and star-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in sandy soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of coastal environments. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Hecatactis wollastonii is considered a species of conservation concern."
