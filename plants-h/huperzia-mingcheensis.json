    "intro": "Huperzia mingcheensis, commonly known as the Mingcheensian clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, densely branched stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces sporangia on specialized structures called strobili, which are typically clustered at the tips of the branches. Native to China, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
