    "intro": "Henoonia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Henoonia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
