    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. matreiense, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in the form of composite heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high elevations. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh mountain conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
