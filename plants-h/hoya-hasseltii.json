It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink, typically during the summer months. Hoya hasseltii is a trailing plant that can be grown as a houseplant or in hanging baskets. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
