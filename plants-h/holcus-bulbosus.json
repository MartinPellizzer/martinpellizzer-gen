    "intro": "Holcus bulbosus, commonly known as the bulbous hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and produces dense clusters of spikelets that are often pinkish or purplish in color. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in meadows, ditches, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a single, dense spike that bears small, two-rowed florets. Holcus bulbosus is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support a variety of invertebrate life."
