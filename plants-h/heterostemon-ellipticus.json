    "intro": "Heterostemon ellipticus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved starflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its elliptical, narrow leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Heterostemon ellipticus is often found in arid or semi-arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought."
