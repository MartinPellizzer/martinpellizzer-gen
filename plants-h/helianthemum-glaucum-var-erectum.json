It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a valuable addition to xeriscaped gardens."
