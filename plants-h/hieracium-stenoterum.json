It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with yellow flowers that bloom in summer.
