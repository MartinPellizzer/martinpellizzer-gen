    "intro": "Hypochaeris foliosa, commonly known as the leafy sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a low-growing annual or biennial plant characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flower heads. The leaves are typically lobed or toothed, and the plant produces numerous small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, often growing in disturbed soils. The plant is often considered a weed but has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
