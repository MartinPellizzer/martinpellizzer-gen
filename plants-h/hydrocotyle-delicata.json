    "intro": "Hydrocotyle delicata, commonly known as the slender water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, rounded lobes, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and wetlands. Its rapid growth makes it both a useful pioneer species in aquatic ecosystems and a potential invasive plant in non-native regions."
