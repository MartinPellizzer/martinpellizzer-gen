It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are typically pink or red, arranged in whorls along the stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Hippotis latifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
