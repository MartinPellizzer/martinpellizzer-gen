    "intro": "Hieracium symphytaceum subsp. pseudoleiopsis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered with fine hairs, while the stem is usually unbranched and hairy. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on long, slender peduncles. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf blades compared to other members of the species."
