    "intro": "Hieracium eupatorium subsp. inuloides, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with lanceolate leaves that are hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
