    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and open woodlands. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
