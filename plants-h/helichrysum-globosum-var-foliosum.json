    "intro": "Helichrysum globosum var. foliosum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or African daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically green and covered in a fine layer of white or gray hairs. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable."
