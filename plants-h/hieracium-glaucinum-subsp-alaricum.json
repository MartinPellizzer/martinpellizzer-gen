    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. alaricum, commonly known as alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing clumps. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a single head surrounded by pale green or white bracts. Its leaves are basal, spoon-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps and Carpathians."
