    "intro": "Hieracium albolineatum, commonly known as the white-lined hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, with leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
