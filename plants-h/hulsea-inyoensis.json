    "intro": "Hulsea inyoensis, commonly known as Inyo hulsea, is a rare flowering plant native to the Mojave Desert in California. It is a member of the Montiaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is adapted to arid environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive species in conservation efforts."
