    "intro": "Hieracium praecurrens subsp. plusiotrichum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are arranged in dense clusters. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other Hieracium species."
