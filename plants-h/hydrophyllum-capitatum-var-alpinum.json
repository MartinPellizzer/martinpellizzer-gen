    "intro": "Hydrophyllum capitatum var. alpinum, commonly known as alpine hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at high elevations. The plant features upright stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, and its small, blue to violet flowers are clustered in terminal heads. It is adapted to cold climates and has a deep root system to access moisture in poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments."
