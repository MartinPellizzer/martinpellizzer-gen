    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. insuccatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense mats. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
