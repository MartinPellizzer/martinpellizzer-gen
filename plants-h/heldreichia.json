    "intro": "Heldreichia, commonly known as the alpine bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the Campanulaceae family. These plants are typically found in high-altitude regions of the Mediterranean, including parts of Greece, Turkey, and the Balkans. They are characterized by their bell-shaped flowers, which are often blue or purple in color. The leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, adapted to the cold and harsh conditions of their mountainous habitats. Heldreichia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in alpine gardens."
