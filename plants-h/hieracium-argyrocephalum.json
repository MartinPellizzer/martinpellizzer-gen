    "intro": "Hieracium argyrocephalum, commonly known as silverhead hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant features a rosette of silver-white, fuzzy leaves that give it its common name, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in the summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
