    "intro": "Hieracium occidentale, commonly known as western hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as fields and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
