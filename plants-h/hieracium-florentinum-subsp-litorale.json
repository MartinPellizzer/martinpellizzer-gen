    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. litorale, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its robust growth habit and ability to withstand harsh coastal environments. This subspecies is often found in dunes and coastal grasslands, contributing to stabilizing sand dunes through its extensive root system."
