    "intro": "Habenaria viridis subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the green orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Australia. It features a slender, upright stem with several ovate leaves that are usually dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are often overlooked due to their muted coloration. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This subspecies is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its habitat."
