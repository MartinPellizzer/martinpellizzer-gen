    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. calamistratum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
