    "intro": "Habenaria hewittii, commonly known as the Hewitt's orchid, is a species of terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
