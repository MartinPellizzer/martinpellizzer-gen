    "intro": "Hypericum hecatophyllum, commonly known as the ghost hypericum, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its unique, almost translucent yellow flowers that appear in late summer. The plant's leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it produces small, red berries in the autumn. Hypericum hecatophyllum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
