    "intro": "Hilgeria serpylloides, commonly known as the mountain sandwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the western United States and northern Mexico. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has a compact rosette of fleshy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It produces small, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Hilgeria serpylloides is adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in dry, sunny locations."
