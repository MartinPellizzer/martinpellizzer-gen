It thrives in shallow, saline waters and is adapted to tolerate varying salinity levels. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. It plays a vital role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for marine life. Its reproductive structures include small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into fruits containing viable seeds."
