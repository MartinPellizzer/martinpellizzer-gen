    "intro": "Hicorius ovata var. borealis, commonly known as the northern ovate hickory, is a deciduous tree native to the colder regions of North America. It is characterized by its broad, ovate leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces edible nuts enclosed in a hard shell, which are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in mixed hardwood forests. Its cold hardiness makes it well adapted to northern climates."
