    "intro": "Helianthostylis suerpo, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its roots form a dense network that helps it anchor to its host and absorb nutrients efficiently. The flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
