    "intro": "Hoya crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are often variegated with cream or green markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya crassicaulis is known for its slow growth and ability to form offsets, which can be propagated easily through stem cuttings."
