    "intro": "Helichrysum balfourii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that remain intact for a long time after blooming, giving it its common name. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum balfourii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and resistance to drought and coastal conditions."
