It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium pseudovaillantii is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
