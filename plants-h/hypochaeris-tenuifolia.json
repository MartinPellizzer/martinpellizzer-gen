    "intro": "Hypochaeris tenuifolia, commonly known as slenderleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via seeds make it both a common weed and a potential invasive species in some regions."
