    "intro": "Hyobanche sanguinea var. glabra, commonly known as the naked Indian whipsnake plant, is a parasitic flowering plant native to parts of Africa. It lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients, typically attaching itself to members of the legume family. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots are specialized for penetrating the host's vascular system. It is often found in dry, open habitats and is considered a rare and specialized species. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a unique role in its ecosystem, though it is not widely cultivated."
