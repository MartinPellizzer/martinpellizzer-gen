    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. shuttleworthianum, commonly known as the shuttleworth's basket-weed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are broadly ovate and often clasping the stem, giving it its specific epithet \"amplexicaule.\" Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are visited by various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is often found in damp, grassy habitats and is considered a relatively rare and localized plant."
