    "intro": "Helleborus atrorubens f. cupreus, commonly known as the Copper Hellebore, is a unique cultivar of the Helleborus genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. This plant is characterized by its striking, dark green to almost black foliage that often has a subtle coppery sheen, giving it its common name. The flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring, are typically deep purple to black, with a waxy texture and a distinctive, spathiform shape. It is a slow-growing perennial that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom during the winter months. Due to its specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-draining soil and partial to full shade."
