It is characterized by its unique four-valved fruits, which are a key taxonomic feature. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. Its leaves are usually compound and have a distinctive, recurved morphology. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
