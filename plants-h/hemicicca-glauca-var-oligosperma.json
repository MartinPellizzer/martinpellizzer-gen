    "intro": "Hemicicca glauca var. oligosperma, commonly known as the desert holly, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub characterized by its narrow, spiny stems and small, waxy leaves that reduce water loss in harsh environments. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its seeds are enclosed in fleshy, red berries that ripen in the summer and are dispersed by birds. This species is well adapted to extreme drought conditions, showcasing remarkable resilience in its native habitat."
