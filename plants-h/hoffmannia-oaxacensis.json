    "intro": "Hoffmannia oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxaca hoffmannia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Mexico. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are often pale blue or violet, and it produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoffmannia oaxacensis is considered a vulnerable species."
