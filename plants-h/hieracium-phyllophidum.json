    "intro": "Hieracium phyllophidum, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers that resemble those of the common buttercup. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, grassy areas and along stream banks. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
