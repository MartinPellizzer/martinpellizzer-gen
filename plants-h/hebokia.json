    "intro": "Hebokia, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes Mountains. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine regions. Hebokia has small, lance-shaped leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh weather conditions. Due to its limited distribution and fragile habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
