    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. niveum, commonly known as the white rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale flowers and compact growth habit compared to other members of the genus."
