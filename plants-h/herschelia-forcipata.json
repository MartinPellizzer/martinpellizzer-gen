    "intro": "Herschelia forcipata, commonly known as the forked tunicate, is a unique marine invertebrate that belongs to the class Ascidiacea. It is characterized by its barrel-shaped body and a distinctive, forked structure at the posterior end, which is used for attachment and movement. The organism is filter feeders, using its siphons to draw in water and extract plankton from the surrounding environment. Its body is covered in a tough, gelatinous tunic that provides protection against predators and environmental stressors. Herschelia forcipata is typically found in coastal waters and is an important component of marine ecosystems."
