    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris var. demersa, commonly known as the water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow, slow-moving waters and has distinctive floating leaves that are heart-shaped with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that emerge above the water surface. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The leaves are often submerged, while the upper ones float, allowing the plant to thrive in wetland ecosystems."
