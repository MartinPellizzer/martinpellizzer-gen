    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. pseudolapponicum, commonly known as the Arctic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Arctic and alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in rocky and gravelly habitats, often in high-altitude environments. The plant features a low-growing rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its leaves are usually covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in cold, dry conditions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads."
