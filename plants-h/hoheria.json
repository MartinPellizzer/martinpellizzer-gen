    "intro": "Hoheria, commonly known as the puka-puka, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its evergreen shrubs with distinctive, often waxy leaves. The flowers, which are typically yellow or orange, appear in clusters and are adapted to attract nectar-feeding birds like the native bellbird. Hoheria species are often found in coastal and cliff habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Their unique appearance and ecological importance make them a notable part of New Zealand's botanical landscape."
