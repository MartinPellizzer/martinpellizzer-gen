    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum var. elongatum, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, woody stems that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow in color, which distinguish it from other varieties of Hypericum. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with four petals, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and lance-shaped, with a slightly glossy surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens."
