    "intro": "Hippuris tetraphylla f. lacunarum, commonly known as the marsh penny cress, is a perennial aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its distinctive four-lobed leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is often found in wetlands, along the edges of ponds, and in slow-moving streams. Its roots help stabilize the soil, preventing erosion in aquatic habitats. The f. lacunarum form is distinguished by its unique leaf structure and habitat preferences compared to other forms of Hippuris tetraphylla."
