It is characterized by its basal rosette of pale yellow to greenish leaves and its arrangement of small, yellow flowers in a composite head. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it is often found in temperate climates. Due to its hardy nature, it can sometimes become invasive in certain regions."
