    "intro": "Haworthia gracilis var. tenera, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically bluish-green with a waxy coating, and the plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for indoor cultivation. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
