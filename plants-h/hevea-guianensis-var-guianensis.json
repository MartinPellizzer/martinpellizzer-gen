    "intro": "Hevea guianensis var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianese rubber tree, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters in height, with a dense canopy and smooth, grayish-brown bark. The plant is characterized by its pinnate leaves, which are alternate and often have a leathery texture. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elongated, woody capsules containing the latex-producing seeds. This species is valued for its natural rubber latex, which has been historically important in the rubber industry."
