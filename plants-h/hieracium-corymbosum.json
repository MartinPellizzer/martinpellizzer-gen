    "intro": "Hieracium corymbosum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are rough and hairy. Hieracium corymbosum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes become invasive in non-native areas."
