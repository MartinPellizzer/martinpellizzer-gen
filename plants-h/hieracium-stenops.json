    "intro": "Hieracium stenops, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
