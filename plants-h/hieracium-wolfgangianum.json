It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range from yellow to orange in color. Wolfgang's hawkweed is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
