    "intro": "Hieracium torrepandoi, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hieracium torrepandoi is often found in open habitats such as slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in full sun."
