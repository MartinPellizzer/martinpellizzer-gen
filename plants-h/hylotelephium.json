    "intro": "Hylotelephium, commonly known as stonecrop, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Crassulaceae. These succulent plants are characterized by their fleshy, often thick leaves and showy, clustered flowers that come in a variety of colors. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and are often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Hylotelephium species are drought-tolerant and thrive in well-drained soil, making them popular choices for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Their ability to store water in their leaves allows them to survive in arid conditions with minimal care."
