    "intro": "Hieracium cuneolus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with linear, often hairy leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. It produces yellow flowers from June to August, and its root system is fibrous, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. Hieracium cuneolus is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
