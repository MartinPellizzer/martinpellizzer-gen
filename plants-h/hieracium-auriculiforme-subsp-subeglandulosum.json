It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are glandular-pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its subspecies distinction is based on the presence of glandular hairs on the leaves and stems."
