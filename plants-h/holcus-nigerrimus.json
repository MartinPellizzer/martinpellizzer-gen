It is characterized by its dark green, tufted foliage and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Holcus nigerrimus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
