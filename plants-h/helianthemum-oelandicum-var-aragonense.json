    "intro": "Helianthemum oelandicum var. aragonense, commonly known as the Aragon cushion plant, is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in rock gardens."
