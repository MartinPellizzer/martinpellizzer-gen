    "intro": "Helianthus subniveus, commonly known as the hoary sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white, fuzzy leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its scientific name reflects its snowy (subniveus) appearance due to the dense, white pubescence on its foliage. Helianthus subniveus is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance."
