    "intro": "Hieracium vallisiacum grex pseudovalesiacum, commonly known as the false valesiacum hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
