    "intro": "Hieracium seminigrans, commonly known as the blackseed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium seminigrans produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to spread across different habitats."
