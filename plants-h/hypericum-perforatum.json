    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive leaves with translucent dots, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate climates. Its stems are often reddish in color, and it produces small, five-petaled flowers in late summer. St. John's wort has been historically used in herbal medicine for its purported antidepressant properties."
