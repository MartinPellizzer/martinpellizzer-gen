    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. debilescens, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant is characterized by its delicate, pale yellow flowers and thin, hairy leaves. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread vegetatively. Due to its fragile appearance, it is often found in less disturbed, nutrient-rich soils."
