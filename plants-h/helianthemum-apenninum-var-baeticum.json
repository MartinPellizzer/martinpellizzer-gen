It features small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, typically on compact, woody stems. The plant has succulent leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the dry, rocky environments it inhabits. It is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy plant in Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
