    "intro": "Humulus scandens, commonly known as the creeping hemp vine, is a climbing plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its vigorous growth habit and ability to twine around supports, often reaching lengths of several meters. The plant features heart-shaped, palmately lobed leaves that are typically pubescent, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, clustered in loose, hanging catkins, and it produces both male and female inflorescences. Humulus scandens is related to the cannabis genus and contains compounds similar to those found in marijuana, though it is primarily valued for its ornamental and historical uses."
