It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body and distinctive striped pattern on its surface. This species primarily infects the bile ducts of its host, which includes various species of fish and amphibians. The life cycle of Hapalorchis lineata involves intermediate hosts such as snails and copepods. Due to its parasitic nature, it plays a significant role in the ecological dynamics of aquatic ecosystems."
