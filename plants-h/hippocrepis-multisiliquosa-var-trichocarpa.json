    "intro": "Hippocrepis multisiliquosa var. trichocarpa, commonly known as the hairy-fruited horseshoe vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, curled, horseshoe-shaped pods that are covered in fine, hairy structures. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, arranged in dense spikes, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators. The varietal name *trichocarpa* refers to its hairy fruiting structures, which are a notable botanical feature."
