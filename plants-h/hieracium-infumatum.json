    "intro": "Hieracium infumatum, commonly known as the smoky hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive smoky or greyish hue. Hieracium infumatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
