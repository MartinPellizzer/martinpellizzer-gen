    "intro": "Hemionitis incarum, commonly known as the mountain hemionitis, is a rare and distinctive plant belonging to the Pteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments. The plant features delicate, pinnate leaves that are covered in a fine, whitish coating, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. It is native to regions in Asia, including parts of China and the Himalayas. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis incarum is considered a vulnerable species."
