    "intro": "Hoya pseudomaxima, commonly known as the giant hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with cream or yellow markings. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya pseudomaxima is popular among plant enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
