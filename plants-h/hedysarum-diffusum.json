    "intro": "Hedysarum diffusum, commonly known as the creeping vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that spread along the ground, often forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. Hedysarum diffusum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
