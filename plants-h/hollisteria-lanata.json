    "intro": "Hollisteria lanata, commonly known as the woolly hollisteria, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its hairy, woolly stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its showy, pink or white flowers bloom in the spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hollisteria lanata is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
