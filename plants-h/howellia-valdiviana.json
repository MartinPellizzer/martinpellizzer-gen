It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, humid climate of its native habitat. Howellia valdiviana is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological importance in its native ecosystem."
