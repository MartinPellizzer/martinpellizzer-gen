It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, indehiscent pods containing edible seeds. Its seeds are often used in traditional medicine and as a food source for local wildlife. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing shelter and food for various species."
