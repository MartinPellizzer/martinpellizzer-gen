    "intro": "Hieracium collinum subsp. uechtritzii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate and covered in fine hairs, while the stem is hairy and often branched. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
