    "intro": "Hippeastrum zephyranthum, commonly known as the rain lily, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant produces a cluster of strap-like, dark green leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a period of dormancy followed by a warm, moist growing season. Hippeastrum zephyranthum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to grow in warm climates."
