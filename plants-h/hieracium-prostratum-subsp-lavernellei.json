    "intro": "Hieracium prostratum subsp. lavernellei, commonly known as the prostrate hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a mat-forming growth habit with numerous slender, often reddish stems that lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in open fields, where it thrives in full sun."
