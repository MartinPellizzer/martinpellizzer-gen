    "intro": "Hemionitis lorentzii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in cloud forests and rocky slopes. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, tuft-like structure, giving it a unique appearance. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate shade and poor soil conditions, making it a hardy species in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
