    "intro": "Hedyotis kingii, commonly known as the King's spurge, is a low-growing perennial herb native to New Zealand. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. The plant produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedyotis kingii is often found in damp, shaded areas such as forests and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
