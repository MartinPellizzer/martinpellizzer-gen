It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats."
