    "intro": "Habenaria polyrhiza, commonly known as the many-flowered twayblade, is a member of the Orchidaceae family. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a single, erect stem that bears multiple small, greenish-white flowers. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient uptake. Its rhizome is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
