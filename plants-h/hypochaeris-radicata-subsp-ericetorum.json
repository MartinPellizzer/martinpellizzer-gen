    "intro": "Hypochaeris radicata subsp. ericetorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies ericetorum is distinguished by its slightly shorter stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Hypochaeris radicata."
