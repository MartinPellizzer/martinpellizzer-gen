    "intro": "Hieracium laurinum subsp. tauryniae, commonly known as the Taurynian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian region. It typically grows in moist meadows and forest edges, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower per stem, which is surrounded by leaf-like bracts. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and its presence in specific, often threatened, habitats."
