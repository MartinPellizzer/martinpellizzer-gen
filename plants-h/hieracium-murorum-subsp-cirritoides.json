It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and has a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. It is often found in moist environments and can form dense colonies.
