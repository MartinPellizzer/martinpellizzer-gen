    "intro": "Haworthia scabra var. morrisiae, commonly known as the Morris' Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with prominent white tubercles and spines. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers on slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and slow growth, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
