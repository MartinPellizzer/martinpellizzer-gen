    "intro": "Hakea tricostata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually grey-green in color and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellowish flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and adaptability to dry conditions make it well-suited for coastal and sandy soils. Hakea tricostata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
