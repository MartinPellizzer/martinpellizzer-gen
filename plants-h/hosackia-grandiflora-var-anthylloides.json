    "intro": "Hosackia grandiflora var. anthylloides, commonly known as the western prairie fringed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the central and western United States. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stems and showy, fragrant orchid-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and prairies, often in areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces a single, elongated spike of flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological importance and is considered a state flower in Kansas and South Dakota."
