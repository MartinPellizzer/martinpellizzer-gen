    "intro": "Hoya fusca, commonly known as the dark hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and dark green leaves that are often variegated with silver or white markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom at the ends of its stems. Hoya fusca is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, which can be used for propagation."
