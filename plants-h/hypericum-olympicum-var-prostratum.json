    "intro": "Hypericum olympicum var. prostratum, commonly known as the prostrate St. John's wort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value. The species is related to other Hypericum species, sharing similar medicinal properties but with a more subdued appearance."
