    "intro": "Hieracium chroocentroides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
