    "intro": "Habenaria uruguayensis, commonly known as the Uruguay orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly Uruguay and parts of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
