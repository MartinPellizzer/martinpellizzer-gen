    "intro": "Haplopappus watsonii var. rydbergii, commonly known as Rydberg's hairycup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The species is notable for its distinctive morphology and ecological adaptation to semi-arid conditions."
