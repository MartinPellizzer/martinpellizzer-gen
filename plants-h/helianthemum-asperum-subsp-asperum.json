It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, typically from May to June. The plant has rough, hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
