    "intro": "Heteropholis, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive silver or gray foliage, which results from dense pubescence on the leaves. The plant is native to regions in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Heteropholis species typically have small, fragrant flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. The wood of some species is valued for its durability and is used in traditional construction and crafts."
