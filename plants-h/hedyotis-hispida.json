    "intro": "Hedyotis hispida, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are often covered in fine, hairy textures. Hedyotis hispida has a rhizomatous root system, which allows it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. It is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
