    "intro": "Hieracium chlorocephalum subsp. adustum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and the plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
