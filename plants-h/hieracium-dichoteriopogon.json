    "intro": "Hieracium dichoteriopogon, commonly known as the two-branched hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some habitats. The species is notable for its distinctive two-branched stem, which gives it its specific epithet."
