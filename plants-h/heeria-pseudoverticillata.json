It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows as a low, spreading shrub with opposite, linear to oblanceolate leaves. Its small yellow flowers are arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Heeria pseudoverticillata is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain areas."
