    "intro": "Haemanthus seretii, commonly known as the Natal bellseed, is a striking bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It features a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a rosette, with a short stem bearing bright red flowers. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Haemanthus seretii is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively low maintenance once established."
