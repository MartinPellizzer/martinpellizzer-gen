    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. exigua, commonly known as the small-leaved marsh penny, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are typically less than 2 cm in diameter, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its dense growth habit makes it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland areas."
