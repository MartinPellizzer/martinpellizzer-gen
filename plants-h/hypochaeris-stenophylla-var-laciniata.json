    "intro": "Hypochaeris stenophylla var. laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf sowthistle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of deeply lobed, pale green leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with ray florets in the center, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through seeds make it both a weed and a potential ornamental plant."
