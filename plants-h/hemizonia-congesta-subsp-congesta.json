It is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, narrow leaves and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. It produces small, woody fruits that contain seeds dispersed by animals. This species is often found in rocky soils and is an important plant in desert ecosystems."
