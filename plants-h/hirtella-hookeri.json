    "intro": "Hirtella hookeri, commonly known as the hairy hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, often covered in fine pubescence. Hirtella hookeri is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
