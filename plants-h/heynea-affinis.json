    "intro": "Heynea affinis, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a tropical tree native to Central and Southern Africa. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, often greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round, woody fruits. Its timber is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it important in local economies. However, due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in many regions."
