It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish flowers that eventually develop into edible, pod-like fruits. The fruit's interior contains a sweet, creamy pulp surrounded by a layer of seeds. Due to its unique appearance and potential nutritional value, it is of interest to botanists and agricultural researchers."
