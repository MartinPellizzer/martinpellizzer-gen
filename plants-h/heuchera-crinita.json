    "intro": "Heuchera crinita, commonly known as the curlleaf heuchera, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, curling leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and thrives in partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is relatively low maintenance once established. Heuchera crinita is also valued for its ornamental foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
