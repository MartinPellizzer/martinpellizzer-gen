    "intro": "Heteropterys banksiifolia var. martiana, commonly known as the Martiana Sycamore, is a species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a large evergreen tree characterized by its thick, flaky bark and broad, palmate leaves that are often lobed. The plant produces small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, round fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in primary and secondary rainforests. Its botanical features make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
