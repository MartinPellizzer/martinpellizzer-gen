    "intro": "Hesperis pachypodium, commonly known as the African milk bush, is a striking plant native to arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry environments. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale purple flowers during the rainy season. Its leaves are typically small and modified into spines, reducing water loss. Hesperis pachypodium is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
