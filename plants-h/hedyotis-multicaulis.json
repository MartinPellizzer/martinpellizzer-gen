    "intro": "Hedyotis multicaulis, commonly known as the hairy buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers clustered in racemes, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and often have a hairy texture. Hedyotis multicaulis is adapted to moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
