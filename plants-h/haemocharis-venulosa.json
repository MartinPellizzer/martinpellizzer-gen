It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, showy flowers with a pinkish hue and a distinctive, spadix-like structure. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis venulosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
