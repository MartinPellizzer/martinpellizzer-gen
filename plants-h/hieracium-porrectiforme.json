It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces seeds in a fluffy, wind-dispersed form. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and garden settings."
