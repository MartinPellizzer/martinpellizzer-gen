    "intro": "Hieracium euctenodon, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are generally basal, forming a rosette, and the plant can spread via rhizomes or seeds. Hieracium euctenodon is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habits."
