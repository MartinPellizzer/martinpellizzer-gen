    "intro": "Hexalectris revoluta, commonly known as the revolute lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green leaves and its distinctive, spiraled arrangement of flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and requires a specific mycorrhizal association for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are usually pink to white in color and produce a sweet, vanilla-like fragrance. Hexalectris revoluta is considered a rare and endangered species due to habitat loss and environmental changes."
