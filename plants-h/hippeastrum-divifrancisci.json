    "intro": "Hippeastrum divifrancisci, commonly known as the Brazilian fire lily, is a striking tropical plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant produces strap-like, dark green leaves that are often mistaken for the leaves of other amaryllis species. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hippeastrum divifrancisci is primarily cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant blooms and unique appearance."
