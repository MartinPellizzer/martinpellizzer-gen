    "intro": "Halimium atriplicifolium f. immaculatum, commonly known as the white-flowered rockrose, is a compact, mat-forming shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically grey-green in color, with a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value lies in its attractive foliage and long-lasting white blooms."
