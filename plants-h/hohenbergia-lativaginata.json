    "intro": "Hohenbergia lativaginata, commonly known as the broad-sheath hohenbergia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of fleshy, sword-shaped leaves. The leaves are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps the plant retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, typically emerging from the center of the rosette. This plant is well adapted to shady, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental bromeliad."
