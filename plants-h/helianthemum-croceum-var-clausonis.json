    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum var. clausonis, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is a low-growing, evergreen shrub that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 20 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent, fleshy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps it conserve water in its arid habitat. The species is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, often found in alpine meadows and scree slopes."
