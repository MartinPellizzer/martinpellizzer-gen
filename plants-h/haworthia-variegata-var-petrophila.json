    "intro": "Haworthia variegata var. petrophila, commonly known as the rock haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features narrow, fleshy leaves with a distinctive white or pale green variegation pattern, often marked by translucent windows. The plant is adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in bright, indirect light. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Due to its compact size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
