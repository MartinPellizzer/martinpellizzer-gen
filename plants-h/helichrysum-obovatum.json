It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant has narrow, silver-gray leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum obovatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to retain its color when dried."
