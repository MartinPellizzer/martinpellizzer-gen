    "intro": "Holoregmia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Holoregmia is native to parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. It is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
