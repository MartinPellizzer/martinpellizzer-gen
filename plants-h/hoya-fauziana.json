    "intro": "Hoya fauziana, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring or early summer. Hoya fauziana is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical and subtropical environments. It is popular among plant enthusiasts for its attractive foliage and ease of care."
