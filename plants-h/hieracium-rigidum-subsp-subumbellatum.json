    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. subumbellatum, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are lanceolate and often reddish in color. Its flowering heads consist of numerous yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The subspecies is characterized by its compact, umbellate inflorescence, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species."
