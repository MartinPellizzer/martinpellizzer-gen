    "intro": "Hulsea vulcanica, commonly known as the volcanic hulsea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, volcanic soils and is adapted to harsh, arid conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom during the dry season, attracting specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hulsea vulcanica is considered a vulnerable species."
