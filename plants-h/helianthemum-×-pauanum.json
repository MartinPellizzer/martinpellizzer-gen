    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 pauanum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum \u00d7 pauanum is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
