    "intro": "Hieracium oxybeles, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, ribbed achenes as fruits. Hieracium oxybeles is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
