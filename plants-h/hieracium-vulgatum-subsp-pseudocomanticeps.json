    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. pseudocomanticeps, commonly known as the false common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, with the outer flowers being ray florets and the inner ones being tubular. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flower structure compared to the typical H. vulgatum."
