    "intro": "Helichrysum retrorsum var. subulatum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. The plant's name derives from the Greek words \"helios\" meaning sun and \"chrysos\" meaning gold, reflecting its sunny appearance."
