    "intro": "Heracleum pusillum, commonly known as small cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant features a hollow, ridged stem and broad, pinnately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its small white to greenish flowers are clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The plant is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and forest edges, where it plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
