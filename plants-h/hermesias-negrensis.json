    "intro": "Hermesias negrensis, commonly known as the Negrense Orchid, is a rare orchid species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Hermesias negrensis is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
