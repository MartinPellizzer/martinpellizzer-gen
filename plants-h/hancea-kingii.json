    "intro": "Hancea kingii, commonly known as the King's hancea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a small, herbaceous plant characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune or coastal scrub habitats. Hancea kingii is adapted to withstand saline and wind conditions typical of its coastal environment. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
