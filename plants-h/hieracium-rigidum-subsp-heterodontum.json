    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. heterodontum, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, rigid stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, arranged in a single, showy head. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
