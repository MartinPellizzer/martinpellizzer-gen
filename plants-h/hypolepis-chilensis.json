    "intro": "Hypolepis chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean water fern, is a species of fern native to South America, particularly Chile and Argentina. It is characterized by its delicate, pinnate fronds that are typically green with a silvery underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near streams or in humid forests. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family. Hypolepis chilensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with high humidity."
