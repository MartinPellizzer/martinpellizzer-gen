    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. nigrelliceps, commonly known as the black-hued hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dark green, hairy leaves and the presence of black-tipped bracts beneath the flower heads. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its specific morphology and habitat preferences, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
