    "intro": "Henckelia smitinandii, commonly known as the Smitinanda's henckelia, is a rare and unique plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
