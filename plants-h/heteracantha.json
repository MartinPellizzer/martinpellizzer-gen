It belongs to the Gesneriaceae family and is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a herbaceous perennial, often forming a compact rosette of leaves. Its flowers come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and blue, and are pollinated by insects. Heteracantha thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
