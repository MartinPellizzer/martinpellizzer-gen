    "intro": "Himantoglossum caprinum subsp. bolleanum, commonly known as the Bolleanum Bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems are usually unbranched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
