    "intro": "Holcus virginicus, commonly known as wild millet, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and typically grows in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, and it is often found in moist or wet environments. Wild millet is sometimes considered a weed but can provide habitat for insects and small animals."
