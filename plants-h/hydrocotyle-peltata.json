    "intro": "Hydrocotyle peltata, commonly known as the arrowhead plant, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies. Hydrocotyle peltata is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
