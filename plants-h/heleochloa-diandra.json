    "intro": "Heleochloa diandra, commonly known as the golden hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its fine, needle-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or wet meadows. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Heleochloa diandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in wetland habitats."
