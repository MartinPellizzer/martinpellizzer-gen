    "intro": "Hypericum rigidum, commonly known as wood hypericum or prickly St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its woody stems, which are covered in stiff, branched hairs, and its clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are opposite in arrangement and often have a slightly serrated edge. Hypericum rigidum is known for its medicinal properties, particularly its use in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for gardens and landscapes."
