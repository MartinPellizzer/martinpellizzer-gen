    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudopellucidum, commonly known as the pale-yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species, particularly in the structure and coloration of its leaves and flowers."
