    "intro": "Holcus pyramidalis, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, tufted clusters of spikelets at the base. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers in early summer. Holcus pyramidalis is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator plant for wetland environments."
