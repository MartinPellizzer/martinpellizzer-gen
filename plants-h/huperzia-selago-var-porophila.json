    "intro": "Huperzia selago var. porophila, commonly known as the narrow-leaf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen herbaceous plant characterized by its creeping, rhizomatous growth habit and linear, needle-like leaves. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. The plant produces sporangia in specialized structures called strobila, which are clustered at the tips of its stems. Its unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an important component of forest floor ecosystems."
