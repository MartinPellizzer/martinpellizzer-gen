    "intro": "Hieracium percodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its fruit. Hieracium percodes is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
