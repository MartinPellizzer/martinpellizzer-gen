It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has lance-shaped leaves and can form dense colonies, often outcompeting other plant species. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
