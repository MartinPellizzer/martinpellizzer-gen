    "intro": "Hieracium lucescens, commonly known as the luminous hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium lucescens is often found in disturbed soils and can tolerate a range of soil conditions."
