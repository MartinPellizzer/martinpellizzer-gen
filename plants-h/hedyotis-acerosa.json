    "intro": "Hedyotis acerosa, commonly known as the scarlet bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branched stems that often lie prostrate on the ground. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis acerosa is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
