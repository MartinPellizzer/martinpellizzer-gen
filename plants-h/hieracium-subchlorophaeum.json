It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads.

Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a pale green coloration, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months."
