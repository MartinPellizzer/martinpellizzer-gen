It is characterized by its yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical features of the Hypericaceae family. The plant produces small, bead-like structures called pseudostems, which are unique to this species. Its leaves are opposite and often have a slightly serrated edge. Hypericum milleporum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
