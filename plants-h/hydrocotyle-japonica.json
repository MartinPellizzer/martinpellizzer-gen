    "intro": "Hydrocotyle japonica, commonly known as Japanese marsh plant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as wetlands and forest floors. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
