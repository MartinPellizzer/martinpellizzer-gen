    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. elatum, commonly known as the tall mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowering heads that are typically arranged in a single stem, with ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
