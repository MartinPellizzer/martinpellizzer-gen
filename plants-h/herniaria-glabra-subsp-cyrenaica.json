    "intro": "Herniaria glabra subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the Cyrenaica sandweed, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, green leaves and tiny, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its succulent leaves store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
