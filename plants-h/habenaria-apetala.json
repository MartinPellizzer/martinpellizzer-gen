    "intro": "Habenaria apetala, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and exquisite orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green or white flower spikes that resemble the shape of a ghost, hence its common name. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree bark without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
