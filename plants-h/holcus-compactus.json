    "intro": "Holcus compactus, commonly known as the tufted hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Holcus compactus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
