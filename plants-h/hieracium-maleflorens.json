    "intro": "Hieracium maleflorens, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium maleflorens is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands, where it spreads through its rhizomes and seeds."
