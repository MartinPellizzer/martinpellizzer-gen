    "intro": "Hedysarum tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It has a creeping growth habit and can form dense mats, which help prevent soil erosion. Hedysarum tomentosum is valued for its role in ecological restoration and as a forage plant for livestock."
