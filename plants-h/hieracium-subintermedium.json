    "intro": "Hieracium subintermedium, commonly known as the intermediate hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets. Hieracium subintermedium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
