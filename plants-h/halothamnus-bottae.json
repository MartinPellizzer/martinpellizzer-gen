    "intro": "Halothamnus bottae, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in saline and well-drained conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by small, berry-like fruits. It has small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white powder, which helps reduce water loss. Halothamnus bottae is adapted to harsh environments and plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
