It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in temperate climates. The subspecies is characterized by its larger, more robust leaves compared to other Hieracium species."
