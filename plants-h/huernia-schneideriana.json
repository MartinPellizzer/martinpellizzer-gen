    "intro": "Huernia schneideriana, commonly known as the Schneider's horned cucumber, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its unique, spiky, greenish-yellow tubercles that resemble horns. The plant produces small, white to yellowish flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting pollinators like moths. Its leaves are fleshy and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Huernia schneideriana is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
