    "intro": "Hibiscus surattensis var. rostellatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscus, is a species native to tropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from deep red to orange. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are narrower than those of the typical hibiscus, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers bloom in summer and are followed by distinctive seed pods that split open to release seeds."
