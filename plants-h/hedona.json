    "intro": "Hedona, commonly known as the \"flower of joy,\" is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its vibrant, bi-colored petals that range from deep purple to bright yellow. The plant has a short flowering period, typically blooming only during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Hedona is valued not only for its aesthetic beauty but also for its medicinal properties, which have been used by local communities for centuries."
