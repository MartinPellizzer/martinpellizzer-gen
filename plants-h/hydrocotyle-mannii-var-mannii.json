    "intro": "Hydrocotyle mannii var. mannii, commonly known as the African water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and white, clustered in umbels, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Hydrocotyle mannii var. mannii is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and healing properties."
