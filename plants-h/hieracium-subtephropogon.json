It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red composite flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
