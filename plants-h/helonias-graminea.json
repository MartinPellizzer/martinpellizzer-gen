    "intro": "Helonias graminea, commonly known as the swamp pink, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that grows in marshy areas, often in association with cypress swamps and pine flatwoods. The plant produces striking pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, which contributes to its common name. Helonias graminea plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
