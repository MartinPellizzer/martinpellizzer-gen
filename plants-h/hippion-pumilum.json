    "intro": "Hippion pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf lily, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its blooming period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
