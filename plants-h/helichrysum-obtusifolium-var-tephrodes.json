    "intro": "Helichrysum obtusifolium var. tephrodes, commonly known as the African crane's-bill, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which retain their color even when dried."
