    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. mollinense, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas. The plant features basal leaves that are narrow and often have a wavy or toothed margin. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. This subspecies is characterized by its distinct leaf morphology and is often found in calcareous soils."
