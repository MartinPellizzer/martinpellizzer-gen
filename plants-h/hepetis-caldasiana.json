    "intro": "Hepetis caldasiana, commonly known as the Caldasian Hepatica, is a perennial herb native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Hepetis caldasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
