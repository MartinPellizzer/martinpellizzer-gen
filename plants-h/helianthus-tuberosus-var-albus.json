    "intro": "Helianthus tuberosus var. albus, commonly known as the white sunflower, is a variant of the common sunflower characterized by its white to pale yellow flowers instead of the typical orange. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to North America, often found in prairies and open woodlands. The plant produces edible tubers similar to those of the common sunflower, which can be cooked and consumed. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a rough texture, and it thrives in full sun with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and historical use in Native American cuisine."
