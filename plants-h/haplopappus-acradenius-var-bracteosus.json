It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or rocky soils. Its small, yellow flowers are followed by papery, bract-like structures that aid in seed dispersal. The species is adapted to drought conditions, making it resilient in harsh, dry climates."
