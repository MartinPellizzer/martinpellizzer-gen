    "intro": "Hesperonia glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky hesperonia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces a sticky substance from its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas and disturbed soils. Hesperonia glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
