    "intro": "Heteropterys byrsonimifolia var. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leaf heteropterys, is a species native to tropical regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in humid, lowland forests. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves that are often covered in small, glandular structures. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically white or pale pink, and it produces berries that are edible for some bird species. The glandular features on its leaves may play a role in defense against herbivores or in chemical communication."
