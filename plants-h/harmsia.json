    "intro": "Harmsia, commonly known as the \"flower of the night,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Gesneriaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil and Peru. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Harmsia species typically have opposite, ovate leaves with a waxy texture, and they thrive in humid, shaded environments. Due to their unique blooming habits and ornamental value, some species are cultivated as houseplants."
