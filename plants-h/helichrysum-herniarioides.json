    "intro": "Helichrysum herniarioides, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, bright yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has narrow, grey-green leaves and is often grown as a ornamental due to its drought tolerance and attractive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. The flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature."
