    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum var. coronopifolioides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are generally smooth or slightly hairy. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
