It is native to the mountainous regions of South America, particularly in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. The plants are shrubs that typically grow in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or gravelly soils. They produce small, edible berries that are an important food source for various wildlife species. Hugueninia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological significance in their native habitats."
