It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often hooded flower structure. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a waxy surface, while its flowers display a range of colors, including green, white, and purple. Helleborine somaliensis is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
