    "intro": "Hibiscus salicifolius, commonly known as the willow-leaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Caribbean, and parts of the Americas. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, willow-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Hibiscus salicifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
