    "intro": "Hypolepis pulcherrima, commonly known as the golden sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its feathery, lance-shaped fronds that are typically bright green with a golden hue on the underside. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in humid tropical forests. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps. Hypolepis pulcherrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated as a houseplant or in shaded garden settings."
