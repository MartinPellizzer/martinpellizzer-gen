It features a mat-forming habit with small, fleshy, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
