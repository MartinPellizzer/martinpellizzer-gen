    "intro": "Heteranthocidium aspecum, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. The plant has long, slender roots and produces delicate, white flowers with a unique, ghost-like appearance. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in the canopy of old-growth forests. Due to its specific habitat requirements and threats from habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many areas."
