It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pendulous flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, fleshy roots that help it store water.
