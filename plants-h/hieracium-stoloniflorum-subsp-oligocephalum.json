    "intro": "Hieracium stoloniflorum subsp. oligocephalum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant has basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its stolons allow it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate local vegetation. It is characterized by its small, elongated flower heads and is often found in temperate climates."
