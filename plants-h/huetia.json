    "intro": "Huetia, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family and is characterized by its unique, elongated leaves that resemble ghostly shapes, hence its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, exhibiting an epiphytic growth habit. Huetia produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom in the evening. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
