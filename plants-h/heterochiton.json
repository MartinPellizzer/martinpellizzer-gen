It is characterized by its foliose thallus, which is typically greenish to yellowish in color. The genus includes several species that are often found on bark, wood, or soil surfaces in temperate and tropical regions. Heterochiton species are known for their ability to form symbiotic relationships with various algae or cyanobacteria. These lichens play an important ecological role in nutrient cycling and soil stabilization in their habitats."
