    "intro": "Hypericum penduliflorum, commonly known as the hanging flowered St. John's wort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Hypericaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida, and thrives in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps. The plant is characterized by its drooping, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its slender, branched stems. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a reddish hue, which adds to its ornamental value. Hypericum penduliflorum is also notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
