    "intro": "Hieracium rivoense, commonly known as the river hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk and surrounding ray florets, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hieracium rivoense is a perennial herb that can form dense colonies, often competing with other vegetation in its native range."
