    "intro": "Helleborus casta-diva subsp. abchasicus, commonly known as the Abkhazian hellebore, is a rare and endemic species native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and striking, waxy white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is adapted to cold, moist environments and thrives in shaded, well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbels and are known for their subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
