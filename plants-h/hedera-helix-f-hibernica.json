    "intro": "Hedera helix f. hibernica, commonly known as the Irish ivy, is a compact, trailing evergreen vine native to western Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. This variety is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded environments, making it a popular choice for ground cover. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in late summer, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. Due to its hardiness and low maintenance, it is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
