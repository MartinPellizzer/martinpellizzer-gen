It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, and is often found in moist, calcareous soils. Its subspecies name, *malacodiaphanum*, refers to its soft, translucent leaf blades, which distinguish it from other *Hieracium* species."
