    "intro": "Herminium pygmaeum, commonly known as the dwarf twayblade, is a small, perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and tiny, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is myco-heterotrophic, meaning it relies on fungi for nutrients rather than photosynthesis. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. Due to its delicate nature, it is often difficult to spot in the wild."
