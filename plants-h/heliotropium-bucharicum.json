It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending growth habit and produces small, violet or purple flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to high temperatures and low precipitation. Heliotropium bucharicum is often found in desert steppes and is an important component of local flora."
