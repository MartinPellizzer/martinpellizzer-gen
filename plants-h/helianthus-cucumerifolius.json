It is a herbaceous annual plant with hairy stems and alternate, heart-shaped leaves that resemble cucumber leaves, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and wetlands. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological studies and native plant gardens."
