    "intro": "Heymassoli, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss. Heymassoli thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
