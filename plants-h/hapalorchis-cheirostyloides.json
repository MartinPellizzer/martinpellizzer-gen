    "intro": "Hapalorchis cheirostyloides, commonly known as the slender liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae. It primarily infects the liver of its host, where it resides in the bile ducts and causes opisthorchiasis. The adult fluke has a flattened, leaf-like body with a distinctive oral groove and a well-developed ventral sucker. Its life cycle involves intermediate hosts such as snails and fish, with the definitive hosts being mammals, including humans. The plant-like appearance of the fluke is a characteristic feature of the family, though it is not a true plant."
