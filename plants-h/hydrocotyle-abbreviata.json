    "intro": "Hydrocotyle abbreviata, commonly known as the narrowleaf marsh mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, white to pale pink flowers throughout the growing season. The plant thrives in moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland environments."
