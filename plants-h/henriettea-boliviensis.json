    "intro": "Henriettea boliviensis, commonly known as the Bolivian Henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Bolivia. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences and vibrant purple to pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea boliviensis is considered a species of conservation concern."
