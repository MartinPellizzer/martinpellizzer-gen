    "intro": "Hieracium skytteanum, commonly known as Skytte's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. Its leaves are basal, with a rough texture and serrated edges, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
