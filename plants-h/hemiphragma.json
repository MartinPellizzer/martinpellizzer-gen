    "intro": "Hemiphragma, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and grayish-green, adapted to thrive in arid environments. Hemiphragma is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
