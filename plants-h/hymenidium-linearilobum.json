    "intro": "Hymenidium linearilobum, commonly known as the slender-lobed mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to New Zealand. It grows on the branches of its host trees, primarily pines and kauris, and derives some of its nutrients from the host through specialized structures called haustoria. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically visited by native bees and other pollinators. Its berries are red and contain seeds that are dispersed by birds. Hymenidium linearilobum is a rare and ecologically significant species, often found in specific forest habitats."
