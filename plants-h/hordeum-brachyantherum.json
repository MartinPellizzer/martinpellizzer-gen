It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green coloration. Hordeum brachyantherum plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
