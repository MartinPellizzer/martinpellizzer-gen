    "intro": "Hooglandia ignambiensis, commonly known as the flame-bark tree, is a unique tropical plant characterized by its striking, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, papery layers. It is native to the humid lowland forests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in warm, moist climates with high humidity. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, serrated leaflets that provide shade and support a diverse array of epiphytic organisms. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or orange hues, and it produces woody, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
