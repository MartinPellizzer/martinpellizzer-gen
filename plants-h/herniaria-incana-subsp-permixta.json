    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. permixta, commonly known as the sand pearlwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit and small, white or pale green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in dry environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland dunes. Its botanical features make it well-adapted to harsh, nutrient-poor conditions."
