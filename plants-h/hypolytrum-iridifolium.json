    "intro": "Hypolytrum iridifolium, commonly known as the blue flag iris, is a striking plant native to the wetlands of eastern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, showy blue to purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Hypolytrum iridifolium is a valuable plant for wetland restoration due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
