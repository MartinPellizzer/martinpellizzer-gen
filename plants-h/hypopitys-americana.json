    "intro": "Hypopitys americana, commonly known as the American ground pine, is a unique evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage that forms a low, mat-like growth pattern. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or yellow in color. Its leaves are persistent, remaining on the plant throughout the year, which is a distinguishing feature in its habitat. Hypopitys americana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
