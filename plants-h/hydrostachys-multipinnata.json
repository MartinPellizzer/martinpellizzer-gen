    "intro": "Hydrostachys multipinnata, commonly known as the water fern, is a species of aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that float on the water's surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its rhizomes spread along the substrate, allowing it to colonize new areas easily. Hydrostachys multipinnata plays a role in water filtration and provides habitat for small aquatic organisms."
