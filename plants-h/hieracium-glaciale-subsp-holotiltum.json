    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. holotiltum, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, silver-gray leaves that are adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountain meadows and scree slopes. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of alpine ecosystems."
