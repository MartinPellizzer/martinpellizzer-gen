It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leaf-like structure, and its leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern. It produces spores in specialized structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Hymenasplenium nigricostatum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates."
