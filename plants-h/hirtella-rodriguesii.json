    "intro": "Hirtella rodriguesii, commonly known as Rodrigues's hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to Madagascar and is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
