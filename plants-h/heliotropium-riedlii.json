It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or blue in color, often arranged in clusters at the ends of branches. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
