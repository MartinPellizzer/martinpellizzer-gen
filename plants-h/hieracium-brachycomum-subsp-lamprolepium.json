    "intro": "Hieracium brachycomum subsp. lamprolepium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
