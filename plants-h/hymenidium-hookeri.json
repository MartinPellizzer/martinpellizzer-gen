    "intro": "Hymenidium hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's bladder, is a small flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its distinctive, inflated fruit capsules. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in umbels, and it produces a unique, bladder-like fruit that splits open to release seeds. Hymenidium hookeri is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and ecological adaptations."
