    "intro": "Hedysarum trinervium, commonly known as the three-veined milkvetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with three leaflets, each having three veins. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum trinervium is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky or sandy soils. Its root system helps prevent soil erosion, making it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
