    "intro": "Heliophila coronopifolia, commonly known as the crowned water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, often found in marshes, pond margins, and along streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base, and it produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in spikes. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Heliophila coronopifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
