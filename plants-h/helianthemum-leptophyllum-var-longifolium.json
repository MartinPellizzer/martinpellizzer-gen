It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, adapted to store water and reduce transpiration. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
