    "intro": "Hieracium acinacifolium, commonly known as the swordleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
