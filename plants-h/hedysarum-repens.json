    "intro": "Hedysarum repens, commonly known as the creeping sainfoin, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are pinnately compound, with three leaflets that are lance-shaped and hairy. Hedysarum repens is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in grasslands and disturbed areas."
