    "intro": "Heliotropium parciflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flower heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its small, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, and it often grows in dry, disturbed habitats. Its flowers open in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism, which aids in pollination. Heliotropium parciflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
