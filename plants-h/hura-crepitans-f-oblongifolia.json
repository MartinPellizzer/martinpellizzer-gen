    "intro": "Hura crepitans f. oblongifolia, commonly known as the tropical hura or the cannonball tree, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers. The leaves are typically broad and oblong, with a velvety texture and a distinctive, almost waxy appearance. The plant produces large, woody fruits that split open to reveal bright red seeds, which are dispersed by animals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Hura crepitans f. oblongifolia is also notable for its rapid growth and ability to form dense thickets in its native habitat."
