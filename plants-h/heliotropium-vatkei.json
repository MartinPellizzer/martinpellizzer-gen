    "intro": "Heliotropium vatkei, commonly known as the velvetleaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its small, showy flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the true heliotropes. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, with hairy, lance-shaped leaves. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open habitats such as roadsides and fields. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
