    "intro": "Hymenolepis minor, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. Its morphology includes delicate, branched stems and small, scale-like leaves. Hymenolepis minor plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for microorganisms."
