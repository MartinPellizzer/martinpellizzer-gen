    "intro": "Henriettella trachyphylla, commonly known as the rough-leaved henriettella, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale pink. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Its unique morphology makes it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation in high-altitude ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
