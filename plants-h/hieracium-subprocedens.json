    "intro": "Hieracium subprocedens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium subprocedens is known for its ability to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
