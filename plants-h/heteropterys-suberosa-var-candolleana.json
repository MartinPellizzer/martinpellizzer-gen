    "intro": "Heteropterys suberosa var. candolleana, commonly known as the Candolleana huito, is a species of flowering plant in the Malvaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Peru. The plant is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in cloud forests. The bark of this plant is thick and cork-like, which provides it with some resistance to environmental stress."
