    "intro": "Haworthia marumiana var. dimorpha, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to pale green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically shorter and broader than those of the typical Haworthia marumiana, giving it a unique appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for dry environments. This plant is prized for its ornamental value and ease of care in both indoor and outdoor settings."
