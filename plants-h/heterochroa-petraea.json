    "intro": "Heterochroa petraea, commonly known as the rock lichen, is a species of lichen that thrives in rocky and arid environments. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its crustose growth form, which adheres tightly to surfaces. The thallus is typically pale to dark green, with a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. It contains various secondary metabolites that contribute to its ability to survive in harsh conditions. This lichen is often used as an indicator species for environmental health due to its sensitivity to pollution."
