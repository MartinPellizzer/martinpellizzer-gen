    "intro": "Haplopappus rubiginosus, commonly known as the red-stemmed pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in a rounded shape, and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
