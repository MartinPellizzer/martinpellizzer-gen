    "intro": "Hibiscus praemorsus, commonly known as the death flower, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from deep red to purple, often with a strikingly white throat. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with palmate leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers bloom in summer and are known for their strong, sometimes unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators. Hibiscus praemorsus is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
