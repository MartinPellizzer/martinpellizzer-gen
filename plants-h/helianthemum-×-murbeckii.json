    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 murbeckii, commonly known as the hybrid stonecress, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is cultivated in gardens and rockeries throughout southern Europe."
