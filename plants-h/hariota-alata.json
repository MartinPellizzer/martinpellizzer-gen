    "intro": "Hariota alata, commonly known as the winged fern, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that have a wing-like appearance, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually bioluminescent, emitting a faint glow at night, which aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant's unique structure and ecological adaptations make it a fascinating subject in botanical studies."
