    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum f. glandulosum, commonly known as the glandular rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant has glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive textured appearance and help reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for xeriscaping and rock gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
