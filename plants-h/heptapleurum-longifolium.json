    "intro": "Heptapleurum longifolium, commonly known as the long-leaved heptapleurum, is a species of flowering plant in the family Actinidiaceae. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in temperate forest environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, with lance-shaped leaves that are often long and narrow. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage rather than its flowers."
