    "intro": "Hutchinsia petraea subsp. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fleshy, paddle-shaped leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
