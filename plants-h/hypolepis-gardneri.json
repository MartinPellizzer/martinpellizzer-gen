    "intro": "Hypolepis gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its shield-shaped fronds that are typically divided into segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the soil surface. Hypolepis gardneri is valued for its ornamental foliage and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
