    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatiflorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The leaves and flowers are often covered in fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
