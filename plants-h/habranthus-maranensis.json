    "intro": "Habranthus maranensis, commonly known as the Maranense bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, specifically found in Brazil. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and has adapted to sandy soils and saline conditions. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves, and it produces showy inflorescences that bloom during the warmer months. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely commercially available."
