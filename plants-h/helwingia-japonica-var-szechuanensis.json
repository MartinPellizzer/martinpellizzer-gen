    "intro": "Helwingia japonica var. szechuanensis, commonly known as the Sichuan helwingia, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Sichuan, China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like leaves that resemble those of a fern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in spring, typically white or pale pink, followed by red berries in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
