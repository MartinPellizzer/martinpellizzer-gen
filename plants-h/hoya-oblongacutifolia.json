    "intro": "Hoya oblongacutifolia, commonly known as the waxy leaf hoya, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that are oblong and pointed. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya oblongacutifolia is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and ease of care."
