    "intro": "Hydnora ruspolii, commonly known as the parasitic flower, is a unique plant species that lacks chlorophyll and relies entirely on its host for nutrients. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it attaches to the roots of other plants and absorbs water and minerals from them. The plant produces a distinctive, often foul-smelling flower that is adapted for pollination by flies. Its structure is simple, with no true leaves or stems, and it is primarily found in southern Africa. Due to its specialized growth habits and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
