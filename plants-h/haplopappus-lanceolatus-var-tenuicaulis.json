    "intro": "Haplopappus lanceolatus var. tenuicaulis, commonly known as the slender-stemmed haplopappus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sandy soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its slender stems and small, linear leaves are features that help reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
