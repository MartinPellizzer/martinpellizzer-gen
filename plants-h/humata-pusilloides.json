    "intro": "Humata pusilloides, commonly known as the dwarf humata, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. The plant features delicate, grass-like leaves that are often clustered at the base, with small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in clusters. Its root system is fibrous and helps it anchor in loose, nutrient-rich soils. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental value."
