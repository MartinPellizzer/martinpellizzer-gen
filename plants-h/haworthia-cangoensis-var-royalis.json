    "intro": "Haworthia cangoensis var. royalis, commonly known as the Royal Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of dark green to bluish-gray leaves with white to pale yellow markings. The plant produces tall, erect flower stalks bearing small, tubular white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
