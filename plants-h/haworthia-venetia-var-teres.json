    "intro": "Haworthia venetia var. teres, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, fleshy leaves with distinct white to light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
