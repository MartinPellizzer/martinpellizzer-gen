It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellowish-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture.
