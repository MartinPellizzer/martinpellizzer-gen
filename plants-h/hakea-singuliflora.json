    "intro": "Hakea singuliflora, commonly known as the single-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear small, bright red or orange flowers. These flowers are typically arranged in a single, terminal spike, giving the plant its common name. Hakea singuliflora is adapted to arid environments and is often found in sandy soils."
