    "intro": "Heliophila lanceolata, commonly known as narrowleaf heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is lance-shaped, and it produces clusters of tiny flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila lanceolata is often used in herbal medicine for its purported calming and digestive properties."
