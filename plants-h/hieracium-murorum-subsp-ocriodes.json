    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. ocriodes, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with a rough, hairy texture. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators. It is characterized by its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an aggressive colonizer in suitable habitats."
