    "intro": "Hebea tabularis, commonly known as the flat-leaf hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its broad, flat leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple, depending on the variety. Hebea tabularis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering season."
