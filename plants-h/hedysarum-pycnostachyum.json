    "intro": "Hedysarum pycnostachyum, commonly known as the dense-stemmed milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in rocky or arid environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum pycnostachyum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
