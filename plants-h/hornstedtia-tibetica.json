    "intro": "Hornstedtia tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan hornstedtia, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf structures and often colorful flowers. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps protect it from the harsh, cold climate. Hornstedtia tibetica is adapted to high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine regions."
