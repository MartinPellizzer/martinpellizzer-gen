It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal regions and sandy habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and flowering display."
