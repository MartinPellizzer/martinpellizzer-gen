It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests and rocky areas. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden use, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
