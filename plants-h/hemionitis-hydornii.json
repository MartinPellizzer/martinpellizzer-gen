    "intro": "Hemionitis hydornii, commonly known as the water fern, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of South America. It has finely divided, feather-like leaves that are adapted for underwater growth and efficient gas exchange. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Its reproductive structures are specialized for dispersal through water, and it plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in many regions."
