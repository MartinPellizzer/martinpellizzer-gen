    "intro": "Haloragodendron racemosum, commonly known as the coastal flax or sea flax, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. The plant features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are arranged in racemes and bloom during the cooler months. Haloragodendron racemosum is adapted to salt-laden winds and can tolerate periodic inundation, making it well-suited to its coastal habitat."
