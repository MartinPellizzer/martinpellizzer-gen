    "intro": "Hydrocotyle bonplandii var. filipes, commonly known as the slender water pennywort, is a aquatic plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are often floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, usually appearing in clusters near the water's surface. The species is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, which can influence aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms."
