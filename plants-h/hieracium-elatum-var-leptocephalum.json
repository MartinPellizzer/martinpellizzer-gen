    "intro": "Hieracium elatum var. leptocephalum, commonly known as the slender-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and typically rough, hairy foliage. The plant features a basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters at the ends of its stems. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often forming dense mats that can outcompete native vegetation. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can be invasive in certain ecosystems."
