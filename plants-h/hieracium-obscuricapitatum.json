    "intro": "Hieracium obscuricapitatum, commonly known as the dark-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with a dark center, giving it its common name. It is often found in clusters, with a basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that rise above them."
