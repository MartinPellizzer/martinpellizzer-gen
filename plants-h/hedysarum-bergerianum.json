    "intro": "Hedysarum bergerianum, commonly known as the Berger's milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe environments. Hedysarum bergerianum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
