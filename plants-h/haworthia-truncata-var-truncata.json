    "intro": "Haworthia truncata var. truncata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically blue-green in color and have a waxy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. It produces small, star-shaped white flowers on tall stems during the summer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental appearance."
