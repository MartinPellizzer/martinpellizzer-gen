    "intro": "Hedysarum moniliforme, commonly known as the bead pea, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit is a slender, cylindrical pod that contains several small, bead-like seeds. Hedysarum moniliforme is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
