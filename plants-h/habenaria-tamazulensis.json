It is native to Mexico, particularly in the states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces delicate, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its beauty."
