    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pumilio, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often covered in a silvery, powdery coating, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum pumilio is notable for its ability to tolerate low light and high humidity, making it a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
