    "intro": "Hedera aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a species of ivy native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a climbing plant characterized by its trailing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant yellow-green color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
