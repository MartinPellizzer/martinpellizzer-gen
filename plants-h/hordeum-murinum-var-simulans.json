It is a low-growing annual species characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, bristly grains. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and natural environments."
