    "intro": "Haplanthus neilgherryensis, commonly known as the Nilgiri dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It has a fibrous root system and produces achenes as its seeds. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its region."
