It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers in early spring. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed or arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure compared to other Horkelia species."
