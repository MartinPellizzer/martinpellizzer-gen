    "intro": "Hymenophyllum costaricanum var. emarginatum, commonly known as the emarginate filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to Central America. It features slender, wiry fronds with a distinctive emarginate (notched) margin, which is a key identifying characteristic. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Hymenophyllaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its intricate, lace-like foliage makes it a popular specimen for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
