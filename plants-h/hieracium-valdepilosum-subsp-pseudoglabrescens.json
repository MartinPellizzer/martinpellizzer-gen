    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum subsp. pseudoglabrescens, commonly known as the smooth-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are lanceolate to ovate, often with hairy surfaces that become smoother as the plant matures. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are characteristic of the genus Hieracium. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced pubescence compared to other members of the species."
