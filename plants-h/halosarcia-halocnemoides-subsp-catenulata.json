It belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that store water. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in coastal areas and saline soils, often forming dense mats to prevent soil erosion. Its morphology reflects evolutionary adaptations to withstand high salinity and arid conditions."
