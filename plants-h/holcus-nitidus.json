    "intro": "Holcus nitidus, commonly known as smooth meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach up to 60 cm in height, with narrow, flat leaves that are smooth and shiny. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet at the tip of each stem, bearing small, two-ranked spikelets. Holcus nitidus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
