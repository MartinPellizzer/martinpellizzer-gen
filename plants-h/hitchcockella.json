    "intro": "Hitchcockella, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the Malvaceae family. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plants typically have woody stems and produce showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. They are adapted to harsh environments with deep root systems and thick leaves to reduce water loss. Hitchcockella species are often used in xeriscaping due to their drought tolerance and ornamental value."
