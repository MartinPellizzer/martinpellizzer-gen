    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. lonchites, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, serrated leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
