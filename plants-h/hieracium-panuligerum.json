It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its showy yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green phyllaries, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium panuligerum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
