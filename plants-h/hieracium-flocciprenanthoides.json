    "intro": "Hieracium flocciprenanthoides, commonly known as the fluffier sandweed, is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. It is a perennial herb native to the sandy soils of the northern United States and southern Canada. The plant features a basal rosette of fuzzy, gray-green leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its flowering stems bear small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant's unique morphology and habitat preferences make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
