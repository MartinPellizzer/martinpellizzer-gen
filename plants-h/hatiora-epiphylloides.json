    "intro": "Hatiora epiphylloides, commonly known as the Easter cactus, is a species native to Brazil. It is a type of epiphytic cactus, meaning it grows on other plants rather than in soil. The plant is characterized by its thick, segmented stems that produce vibrant, showy flowers during the Easter season. Its leaves are typically green and fleshy, adapted to store water. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
