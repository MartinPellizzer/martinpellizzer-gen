    "intro": "Haloragis acutangula f. turbinata, commonly known as the Turbinated willowherb, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Haloragaceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, often prostrate stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are usually borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, often wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive turbinated (turbinate) calyx, which gives it its specific epithet."
