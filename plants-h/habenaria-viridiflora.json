    "intro": "Habenaria viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which are often mistaken for leaves due to their shape and color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
