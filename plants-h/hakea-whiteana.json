    "intro": "Hakea whiteana, commonly known as the white hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and clusters of white, bottle-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like seed pods that remain on the plant for an extended period. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing drought tolerance and fire resilience. Hakea whiteana is often found in coastal heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
