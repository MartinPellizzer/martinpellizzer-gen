    "intro": "Hesperevax acaulis var. acaulis, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States. It has a compact, cushion-like structure with dense, small, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to harsh desert conditions, with deep root systems and a waxy cuticle to minimize evaporation. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
