    "intro": "Hieracium tephrinoides, commonly known as the tephra hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of Central America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions outside its native range."
