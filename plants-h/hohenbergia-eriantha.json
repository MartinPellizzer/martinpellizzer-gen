    "intro": "Hohenbergia eriantha, commonly known as the silver star bromeliad, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia eriantha is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
