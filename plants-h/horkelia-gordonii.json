    "intro": "Horkelia gordonii, commonly known as Gordon's horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Polemoniaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Horkelia gordonii is an important component of its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
