    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. paucifoliatum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
