    "intro": "Hydrocotyle coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf water arum, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface, which is a distinguishing botanical characteristic. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic environments. Its flowering stems produce small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in a spadix, typical of the Araceae family. The plant's rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, contributing to its presence in various wetland habitats."
