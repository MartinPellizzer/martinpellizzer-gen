    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule subsp. fouresii, commonly known as the Corsican hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically hairy and have a broad, lobed shape. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters called capitula, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often clasping, wrapping around the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats."
