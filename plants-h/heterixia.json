    "intro": "Heterixia, commonly known as the false holly or Christmas star, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants are characterized by their showy, clustered flowers that often resemble stars, hence the common name. They typically have opposite, ovate leaves with a rough texture and are often used in ornamental horticulture. Heterixia species are also valued for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and their relatively low maintenance requirements."
