It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy yellow flowers. The plant has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread aggressively in suitable habitats.

Hieracium megatrichum is often found in disturbed soils and can become invasive in certain regions."
