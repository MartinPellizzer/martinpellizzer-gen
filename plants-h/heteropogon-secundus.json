    "intro": "Heteropogon secundus, commonly known as the narrowleaf false brome, is a grass species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter wide. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows, and is often found in the understory of forests. Its botanical features make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
