    "intro": "Hippocratea warmingii, commonly known as the Sierra Madre orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers with a unique coloration pattern. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often at high elevations where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its botanical features include showy, pendulous flowers that bloom in late spring, and it has linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
