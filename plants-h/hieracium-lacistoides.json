It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found near lakes and wetlands. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinct basal rosette structure. The flowers are yellow and produce seeds that are dispersed by the wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
