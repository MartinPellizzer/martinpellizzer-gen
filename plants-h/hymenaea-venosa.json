    "intro": "Hymenaea venosa, commonly known as the yellow cedar or Brazilian cedar, is a deciduous tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, palmately lobed leaves. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody, pod-like fruits containing angular, hard seeds. Hymenaea venosa is valued for its durable, aromatic wood, which has been used historically for construction and furniture. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
