    "intro": "Hydrostachys polymorpha, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with numerous stolons that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across wetland areas. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Hydrostachys polymorpha thrives in shallow water and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of rivers."
