    "intro": "Hanburyophyton, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its reliance on a symbiotic relationship with specific fungi for nutrient absorption. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Hanburyophyton is classified as an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is listed as critically endangered in many regions."
