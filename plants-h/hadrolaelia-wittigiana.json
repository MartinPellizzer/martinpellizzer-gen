    "intro": "Hadrolaelia wittigiana, commonly known as the Wittigiana orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in high-altitude, cool, and humid environments. The plant features a short, stocky rhizome with a few leaves and produces delicate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and purple. Its blooms are typically small and clustered, often appearing in late summer or early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
