    "intro": "Hymenocallis howardii, commonly known as the Howard's spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow with a prominent green throat. The plant produces narrow, strap-like leaves that are often evergreen, providing a lush backdrop to its dramatic blooms. Hymenocallis howardii thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens in warmer climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom reliably during the spring and early summer."
