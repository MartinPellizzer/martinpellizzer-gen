    "intro": "Hymenocallis partita, commonly known as the split-lily, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its large, showy white flowers with a distinctive split in the petals, which give it its common name. The plant produces broad, strap-like leaves that are often used in floral arrangements due to their aesthetic appeal. Hymenocallis partita thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a popular choice in gardens and as a cut flower."
