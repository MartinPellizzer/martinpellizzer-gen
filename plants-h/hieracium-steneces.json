It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Native to Europe, it is often found in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
