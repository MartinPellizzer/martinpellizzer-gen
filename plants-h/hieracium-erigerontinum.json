    "intro": "Hieracium erigerontinum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and bright yellow daisy-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium erigerontinum is native to Europe but has been introduced to other regions, where it can sometimes become invasive."
