    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. lucidulum, commonly known as the glossy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and thrives in meadows and along roadsides. It produces a basal rosette of leaves and has a flowering stem that bears numerous small, clustered flowers. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
