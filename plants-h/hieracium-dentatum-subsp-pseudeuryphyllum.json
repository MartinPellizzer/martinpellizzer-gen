    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. pseudeuryphyllum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer months. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy stems and leaves with serrated edges, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweed species due to its similar morphology."
