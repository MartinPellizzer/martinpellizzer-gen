    "intro": "Halochloa, commonly known as saltgrass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. These plants are typically found in saline or coastal environments, where they tolerate high salt concentrations in the soil. Halochloa species are characterized by their narrow, grass-like leaves and small, spike-like inflorescences. They play an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to their salt tolerance, they are often used in ecological restoration projects in arid and coastal regions."
