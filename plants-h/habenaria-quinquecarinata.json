It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with distinct sepals and petals, often arranged in a spike. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions."
