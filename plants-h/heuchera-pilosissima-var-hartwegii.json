It features dense, woolly foliage that is typically a deep purple or bronze color, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique texture and color, making it a standout in shaded landscapes."
