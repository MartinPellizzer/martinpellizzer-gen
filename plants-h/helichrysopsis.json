    "intro": "Helichrysopsis, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to South Africa and are characterized by their bright yellow or orange flowers that remain intact for a long time, giving the appearance of being ever-lasting. The flowers are typically arranged in dense, spherical or conical inflorescences, and the leaves are usually linear or lance-shaped. Helichrysopsis species are often used in floral arrangements due to their durability and vibrant color. They prefer well-drained soil and full sun, making them suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas."
