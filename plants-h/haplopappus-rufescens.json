It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are small and yellow, forming dense clusters. The plant produces achenes with pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal."
