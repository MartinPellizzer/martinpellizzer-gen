    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. resupinatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. It is notable for its ability to spread via rhizomes, forming dense mats that can dominate local vegetation."
