It is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
