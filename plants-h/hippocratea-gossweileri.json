    "intro": "Hippocratea gossweileri, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically feature a vivid yellow or orange lip and intricate patterns. The plant grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and illegal collection, it is threatened with extinction in the wild."
