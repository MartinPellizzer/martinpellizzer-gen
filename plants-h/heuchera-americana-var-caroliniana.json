    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina alumroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, colorful leaves that range from green to red, purple, and bronze. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to naturalize in suitable conditions."
