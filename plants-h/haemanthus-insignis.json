    "intro": "Haemanthus insignis, commonly known as the Natal star lily, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, adapting it to its arid environment. The plant produces striking, star-shaped white flowers with red stamens, which bloom in spring. It is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
