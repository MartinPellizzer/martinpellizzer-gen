    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rhombifolia, commonly known as the arrowleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It features arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface, with submerged leaves that are narrower and more elongated. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, typically in clusters at the water's edge. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which can help stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Hydrocotyle rhombifolia is often found in temperate regions and is adapted to both still and flowing water environments."
