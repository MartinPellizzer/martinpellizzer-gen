    "intro": "Helleborine viridiflora f. dunensis, commonly known as the green-flowered helleborine, is a rare orchid species native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes. It has a rhizomatous root system and is often found in association with specific fungal mycorrhizae. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
