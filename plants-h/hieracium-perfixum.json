    "intro": "Hieracium perfixum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
