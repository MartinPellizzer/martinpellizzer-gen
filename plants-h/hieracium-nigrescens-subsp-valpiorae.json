    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. valpiorae, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from June to August. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
