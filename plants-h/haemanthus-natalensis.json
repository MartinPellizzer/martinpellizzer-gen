It features striking white, star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette, and its bulbs store water and nutrients for the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and rockeries."
