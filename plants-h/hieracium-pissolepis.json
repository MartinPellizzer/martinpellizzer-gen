    "intro": "Hieracium pissolepis, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium pissolepis is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
