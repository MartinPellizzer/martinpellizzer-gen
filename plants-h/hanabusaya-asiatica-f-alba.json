    "intro": "Hanabusaya asiatica f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered hanabusaya, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant is distinguished by its pale white to cream-colored flowers, which contrast with its dark green, pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
