    "intro": "Hydrocotyle comocarpa, commonly known as the water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to the Americas. It typically grows in shallow water or wet soil, with leaves that are rounded and floating or submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered at the base of the leaves. Its roots help stabilize the soil, making it useful in wetland restoration projects. Hydrocotyle comocarpa is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
