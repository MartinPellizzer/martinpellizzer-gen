    "intro": "Hieracium cerinthoides subsp. neochlorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowers are composed of ray florets and tubular disc florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other Hieracium species."
