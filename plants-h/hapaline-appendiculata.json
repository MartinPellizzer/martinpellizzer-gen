    "intro": "Hapaline appendiculata, commonly known as the common liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It is a small, leafy plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has a thalloid structure, which is a flat, ribbon-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. Its reproductive structures include both male and female gametophytes, which are involved in sexual reproduction. Hapaline appendiculata plays an important ecological role by contributing to soil stability and providing habitat for microorganisms."
