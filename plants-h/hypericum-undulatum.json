    "intro": "Hypericum undulatum, commonly known as the wavy St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval with a wavy edge, giving it its common name. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils. It contains hypericin and other compounds, which have been studied for their potential medicinal properties. However, it is important to note that some species of Hypericum can be toxic if ingested."
