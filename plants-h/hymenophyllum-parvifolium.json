    "intro": "Hymenophyllum parvifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical rainforests. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are arranged in lines on the underside of the fronds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
