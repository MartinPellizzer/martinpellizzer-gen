    "intro": "Heleochloa alpicola, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a small, perennial grass species native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas and other mountainous areas. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, which help it survive in cold, harsh environments. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountain pastures. Heleochloa alpicola plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native range. Its botanical features make it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
