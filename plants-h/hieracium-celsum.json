    "intro": "Hieracium celsum, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for certain pollinators."
