    "intro": "Heracleum pastinacifolium subsp. transcaucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian hogweed, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features large, deeply lobed leaves that resemble those of wild celery, with a distinctive silvery-white underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its stems are often covered in coarse hairs and can grow up to 2 meters in height. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
