    "intro": "Hypericum kiboense, commonly known as the Kibo hypericum, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of East Africa, particularly Tanzania. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and woody stems, which are typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant thrives in rocky and well-drained soils, often found in mountainous areas with cool climates. Its leaves are usually small and opposite, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its restricted habitat, Hypericum kiboense is considered a rare and endemic species."
