It features small, rounded, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to store water and withstand arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
