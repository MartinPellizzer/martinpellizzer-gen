    "intro": "Hymenachne polymorpha var. micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered hymenachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland or aquatic environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of water. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are usually floating or semi-submerged, with small, narrow leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are clustered and often covered in fine hairs. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact flowers compared to other varieties of Hymenachne."
