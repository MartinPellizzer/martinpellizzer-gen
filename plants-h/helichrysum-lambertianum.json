    "intro": "Helichrysum lambertianum, commonly known as Lambert's immortelle, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain dry and crisp after blooming, giving it a \"immortelle\" appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid conditions. Its small, linear leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces numerous small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helichrysum lambertianum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
