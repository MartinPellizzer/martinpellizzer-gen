    "intro": "Hemisphaera circassica, commonly known as the Caucasian hemisphaera, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its unique hemispherical flower head, which resembles a small bowl or hemisphere, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually a mix of white and pink, with a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemisphaera circassica is considered a vulnerable species."
