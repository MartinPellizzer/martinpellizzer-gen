    "intro": "Hieracium oblongulare, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disk of tubular florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native flora in certain regions."
