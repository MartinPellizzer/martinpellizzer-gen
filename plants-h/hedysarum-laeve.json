    "intro": "Hedysarum laeve, commonly known as the smooth vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in disturbed areas. Hedysarum laeve is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration."
