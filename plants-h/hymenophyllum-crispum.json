    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crispum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, wavy, and silvery-green fronds that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to regions in the Pacific, including New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and parts of Australia. Its intricate frond structure allows it to efficiently capture moisture from the air, which is essential for its survival in its natural habitat. Hymenophyllum crispum is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical forests."
