    "intro": "Helictotrichon sulcatum, commonly known as the rough bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats or clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands, prairies, and along roadsides. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
