It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant features elongated, narrow leaves that are often recurved, and its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive disc of tubular florets. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its finely serrated leaf margins and a more slender stem compared to other hawkweed species."
