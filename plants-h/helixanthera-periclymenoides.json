It is a herbaceous annual with delicate, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and a fibrous root system. It thrives in disturbed soils and sunny habitats, often found in fields and along roadsides. Its rapid growth and short life cycle make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
