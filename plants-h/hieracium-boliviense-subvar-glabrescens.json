    "intro": "Hieracium boliviense subvar. glabrescens, commonly known as the Bolivian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grasslands and open areas, preferring well-drained soils. It has a rosette of basal leaves that are generally covered with fine hairs, though the subspecies glabrescens is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy foliage. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens."
