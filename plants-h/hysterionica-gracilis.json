    "intro": "Hysterionica gracilis, commonly known as the slender ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is a terrestrial herb with slender, wiry stems and small, pale green leaves that are often hidden beneath the soil. The plant produces delicate, white or greenish-white flowers with a unique, ghostly appearance. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically in pine flatwoods or wetlands. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
