    "intro": "Hordeum riehlii, commonly known as Riehli's barley, is a species of grass native to Central Asia. It is a perennial plant characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces tiny grains that are typically wind-pollinated, a common trait among grasses. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in open, disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Hordeum genus."
