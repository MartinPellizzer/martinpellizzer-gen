    "intro": "Heliconia psittacorum var. gracilis, commonly known as the parrot's bill heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that resemble parrots' beaks, with vibrant orange and red bracts. The plant has narrow, strap-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color."
