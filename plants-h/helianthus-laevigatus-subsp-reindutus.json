    "intro": "Helianthus laevigatus subsp. reindutus, commonly known as the smooth sunflower, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features robust, hairy stems and large, showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a disk of dark brown, tubular florets. The leaves are typically smooth and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This subspecies is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its botanical characteristics make it a notable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
