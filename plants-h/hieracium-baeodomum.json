    "intro": "Hieracium baeodomum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation."
