    "intro": "Hydrocotyle inundata, commonly known as water shield, is a semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and shallow water areas. It has floating leaves that are usually divided into small, rounded segments, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered at the base of the leaves. Its root system helps stabilize the soil and prevent erosion in aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle inundata is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
