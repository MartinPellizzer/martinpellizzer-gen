    "intro": "Heliophila affinis, commonly known as the water starwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, ditches, and marshes. The plant features small, star-shaped white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often floating on the water surface or submerged beneath it. Heliophila affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
