    "intro": "Harpalyce virgata, commonly known as the slender harpalyce, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemate clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Harpalyce virgata plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest to botanists studying native flora."
