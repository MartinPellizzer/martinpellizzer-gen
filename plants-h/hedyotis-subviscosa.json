    "intro": "Hedyotis subviscosa, commonly known as sticky false pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, sticky hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces tiny, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a useful groundcover and a potential weed in certain areas."
