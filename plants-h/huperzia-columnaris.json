    "intro": "Huperzia columnaris, commonly known as the club moss, is a perennial evergreen fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. The plant features small, scale-like leaves that form a rosette pattern, and it produces spore-bearing structures called strobila on its stems. Huperzia columnaris is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to form dense ground cover. It is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
