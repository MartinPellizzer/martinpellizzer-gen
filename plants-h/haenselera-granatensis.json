    "intro": "Haenselera granatensis, commonly known as the Granatense Hensel's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant, showy flowers that typically display shades of red and orange, which are adapted to attract specific pollinators. The plant has a compact growth habit with fleshy, strap-like leaves that help it conserve water in its arid habitat. It blooms during the dry season, showcasing its ornamental value and ecological significance. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
