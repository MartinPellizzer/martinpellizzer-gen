    "intro": "Hieracium pollinarium var. platyphyllum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. Its inflorescence is a flat-topped or slightly rounded head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. The species is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance and aid in water retention."
