    "intro": "Hicriopteris yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan water fern, is a rare species of aquatic fern native to China. It belongs to the family Pellaeaceae and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, where it can receive adequate sunlight. Its spores are released into the water, allowing for propagation in suitable habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
