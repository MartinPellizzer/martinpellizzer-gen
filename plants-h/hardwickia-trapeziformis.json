    "intro": "Hardwickia trapeziformis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thick, fissured bark that provides protection against fire and insect infestation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by elongated, woody pods containing flat, elliptical seeds. It is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient species in arid and semi-arid environments. Its hard, heavy wood is highly valued for construction and tool-making, though its slow growth rate makes it a conservation concern."
