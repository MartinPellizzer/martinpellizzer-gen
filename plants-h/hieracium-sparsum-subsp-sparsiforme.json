    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. sparsiforme, commonly known as the sparsely hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of broadly lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head surrounded by a ring of bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its sparse, spreading hairs and shorter flower stems compared to other members of the species."
