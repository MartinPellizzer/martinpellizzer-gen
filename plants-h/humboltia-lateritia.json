    "intro": "Humboltia lateritia, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are small, narrow, and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Humboltia lateritia plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for small animals."
