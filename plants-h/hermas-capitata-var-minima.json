    "intro": "Hermas capitata var. minima, commonly known as the dwarf rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. The plant has a compact growth habit with hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its flowers are arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is well adapted to rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and dry slopes."
