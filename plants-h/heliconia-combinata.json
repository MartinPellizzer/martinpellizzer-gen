    "intro": "Heliconia combinata, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its vibrant, pendulous inflorescences composed of brightly colored bracts. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Heliconia combinata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower."
