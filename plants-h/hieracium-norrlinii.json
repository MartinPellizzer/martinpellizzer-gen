    "intro": "Hieracium norrlinii, commonly known as the Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
