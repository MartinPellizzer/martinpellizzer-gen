It belongs to the family Hyacinthaceae and is characterized by its compact rosette of grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
