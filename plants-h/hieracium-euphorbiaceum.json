    "intro": "Hieracium euphorbiaceum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by bracts, and it produces seeds in achenes that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium euphorbiaceum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
