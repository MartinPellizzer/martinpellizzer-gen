It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are surrounded by pale green ray florets.
