    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius nigrescens subsp. lamprophylloides, commonly known as the glossy-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from June to August. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
