    "intro": "Hirtella butayei, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it typically grows in humid, shaded understory environments. The plant is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are white or pale pink and are clustered in small inflorescences, often producing a mild aromatic scent. Hirtella butayei is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations and limited distribution."
