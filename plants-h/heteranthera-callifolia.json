    "intro": "Heteranthera callifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyssop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, blue to purple flowers in whorled clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for wetland environments, making it a valuable wetland indicator species. Botanically, it is characterized by its dimorphic anthers, which are a key feature in its classification within the family Lamiaceae."
