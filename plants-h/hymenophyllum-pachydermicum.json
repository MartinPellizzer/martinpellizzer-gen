    "intro": "Hymenophyllum pachydermicum, commonly known as the thick-leaved fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds with closely spaced, minute spore cases. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically thick and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. The spores are released from the undersides of the leaves, contributing to its reproductive strategy in moist, tropical climates."
