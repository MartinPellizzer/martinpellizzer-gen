    "intro": "Hedera helix f. digitata, commonly known as the fingered ivy, is a compact, trailing evergreen vine characterized by its distinctive, lobed, palmate leaves that resemble fingers. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value, featuring dark green foliage with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in partial to full shade and is adaptable to various soil types, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor cultivation. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an excellent choice for ground cover or hanging baskets."
