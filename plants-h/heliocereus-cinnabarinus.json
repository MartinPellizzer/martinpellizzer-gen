    "intro": "Heliocereus cinnabarinus, commonly known as the red-hued night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems and clusters of sharp, spiny leaves. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pink. These flowers emit a strong, sweet scent to attract nocturnal pollinators like moths. Due to its striking appearance and unique flowering behavior, it is a popular choice for collectors and gardeners."
