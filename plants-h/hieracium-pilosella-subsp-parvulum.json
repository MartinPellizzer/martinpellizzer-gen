    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. parvulum, commonly known as the small hairy hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features a rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in clusters. The plant thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are often followed by seed heads that are easily dispersed by wind. It is considered a weedy species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
