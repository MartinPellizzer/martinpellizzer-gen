It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its small, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are surrounded by a spathe, a feature common in the Araceae family. It thrives in humid, shady environments and is often cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental foliage.
