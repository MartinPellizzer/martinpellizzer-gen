    "intro": "Hieracium norvegicum subsp. hogdalense, commonly known as the Norwegian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to northern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and waste areas. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
