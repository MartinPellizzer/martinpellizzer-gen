    "intro": "Heterostemon mimosoides var. coriaceus, commonly known as the rough-leaved mimosa, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically covered in a rough, leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the wet season. Its bark is thick and fibrous, providing structural support and contributing to its drought tolerance. The species is often found in coastal and sandy soils, adapting well to harsh environmental conditions."
