    "intro": "Helenium pinnatifidum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, pinnately divided leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its showy yellow-orange flower heads appear in late summer to early autumn, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helenium pinnatifidum is typically found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, sandy soils."
