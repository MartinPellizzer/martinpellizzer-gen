    "intro": "Heteropogon villosus subvar. gardneri, commonly known as the Gardner's hairy grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in open, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Its inflorescence consists of a dense panicle with spikelets that are loosely arranged. This subvariety is notable for its ecological adaptability and is sometimes used in restoration projects due to its hardy nature."
