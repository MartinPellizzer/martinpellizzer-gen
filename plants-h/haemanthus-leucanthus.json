    "intro": "Haemanthus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered haemanthus, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often blue-green in color. The plant produces umbels of white, star-shaped flowers during the winter months, which are highly attractive to pollinators. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its preference for specific climatic conditions."
