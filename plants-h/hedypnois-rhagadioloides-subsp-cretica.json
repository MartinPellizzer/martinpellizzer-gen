    "intro": "Hedypnois rhagadioloides subsp. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan hedypnois, is a rare flowering plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or calcareous soils, often in dry, sunny habitats. It is known for its limited distribution and is considered a regional endemic, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists. Due to its restricted range and habitat specificity, it is vulnerable to environmental changes and human disturbance."
