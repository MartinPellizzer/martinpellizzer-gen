    "intro": "Hieracium pannosum subsp. pannosum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and produces seeds in small, dandelion-like capitula. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance."
