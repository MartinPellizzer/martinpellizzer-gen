    "intro": "Hemiphylacus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. The leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. Hemiphylacus species are often found in moist, rocky soils in temperate regions. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
