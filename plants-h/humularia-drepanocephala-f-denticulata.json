    "intro": "Humularia drepanocephala f. denticulata, commonly known as the denticulate humularia, is a rare and specialized plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and ecologically significant species."
