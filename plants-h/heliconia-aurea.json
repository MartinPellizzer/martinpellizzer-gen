    "intro": "Heliconia aurea, commonly known as the golden heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that range from yellow to orange in hue. The plant produces clusters of small, red flowers that are typically hidden within the inflorescence. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid habitat. Heliconia aurea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and plays a role in the ecosystem as a food source for certain pollinators."
