    "intro": "Hypericum hircinum subsp. albimontanum, commonly known as the alpine St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the stems are often reddish in color. This subspecies is distinguished by its pale greenish-white flowers, which contrast with the darker foliage of the typical H. hircinum."
