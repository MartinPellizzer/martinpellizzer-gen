    "intro": "Hyparrhenia luembensis, commonly known as the African grass or Luembensis grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green and sometimes reddish at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Hyparrhenia luembensis is valued for its use in traditional thatching and as a forage plant for livestock."
