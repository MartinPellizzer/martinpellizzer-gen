    "intro": "Hedyotis centranthoides f. mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's hedge nettle, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively on the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories or rocky areas, where it thrives in the unique microclimates of the Hawaiian Islands. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, it is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
