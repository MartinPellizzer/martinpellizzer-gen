    "intro": "Hieracium sciadophorum subsp. ignotum, commonly known as the dark-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf structure and flower morphology. It is often found in association with other plants in temperate forest understories."
