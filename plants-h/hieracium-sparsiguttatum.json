It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered with small, yellowish glandular dots, which are characteristic of the genus Hieracium. Its flowers are yellow, with a central disk and ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in open habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
