    "intro": "Hieracium cinerascens subsp. arnicoides, commonly known as the cinerary hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces small, daisy-like inflorescences. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
