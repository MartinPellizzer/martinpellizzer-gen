    "intro": "Hierochloe alpina var. vivipara, commonly known as the alpine hairgrass, is a variant of the alpine hairgrass species native to mountainous regions. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in high-altitude environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and fine, grass-like leaves. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing structure to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
