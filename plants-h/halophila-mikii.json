    "intro": "Halophila mikii, commonly known as Mikii's halophyte, is a marine flowering plant belonging to the Alismataceae family. It is a submerged aquatic plant found in coastal and brackish water environments, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss in its saline habitat. It produces tiny, white flowers that are typically clustered in spike-like inflorescences. Halophila mikii plays an important role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
