It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
