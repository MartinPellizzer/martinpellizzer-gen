    "intro": "Hieracium definitum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can spread aggressively through rhizomes and seeds. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium definitum is often considered a weed due to its invasive tendencies in certain regions."
