    "intro": "Heuchera ovalifolia var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine heuchera, is a species native to the mountainous regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, heart-shaped leaves that vary in color from green to red and purple. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in alpine settings."
