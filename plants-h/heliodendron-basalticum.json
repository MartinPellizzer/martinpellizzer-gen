    "intro": "Heliodendron basalticum, commonly known as the basaltic suntree, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions with basaltic soil. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that resemble sunflowers, which bloom in late spring. The plant has a woody stem with a distinctive, rugged texture that adapts to its rocky environment. Its leaves are typically narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern to maximize sunlight absorption. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered an endangered species and requires specific environmental conditions to thrive."
