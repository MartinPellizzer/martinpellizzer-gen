    "intro": "Haworthia jansenvillensis var. flavida, commonly known as the yellow-flowered Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green with white or yellow markings. The plant produces upright, tubular inflorescences bearing yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
