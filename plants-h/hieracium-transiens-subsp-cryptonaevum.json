    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. cryptonaevum, commonly known as the cryptic hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces a single flower head per stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
