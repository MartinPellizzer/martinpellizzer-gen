    "intro": "Heteropterys procoriacea f. eglandulosa, commonly known as the glandless heteropterys, is a variant of the species native to the Amazon basin. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are typically glabrous, lacking the glandular structures found in the typical form. This form is of interest in botanical studies due to its distinct morphological features and potential ecological adaptations."
