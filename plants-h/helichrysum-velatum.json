It is characterized by its densely hairy, silver-gray foliage and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces papery, maturing to golden-yellow seed heads, which give it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum velatum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
