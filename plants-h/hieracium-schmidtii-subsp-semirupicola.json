    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. semirupicola, commonly known as Schmidt's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with ray florets. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
