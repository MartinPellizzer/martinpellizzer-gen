    "intro": "Hieracium megalanthelum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in disturbed soils. It produces showy yellow flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
