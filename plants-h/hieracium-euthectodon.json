    "intro": "Hieracium euthectodon, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish composite flowers and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across open habitats. Hieracium euthectodon is often found in disturbed areas and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural settings."
