    "intro": "Humulus japonicus var. minor, commonly known as Japanese hop or minor hop, is a climbing perennial plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Cannabaceae family and is characterized by its vine-like growth habit and hairy, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known relative of the more widely cultivated hops."
