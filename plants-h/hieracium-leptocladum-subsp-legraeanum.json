    "intro": "Hieracium leptocladum subsp. legraeanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. This subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and more delicate foliage compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
