    "intro": "Herniaria bollei, commonly known as the rock crasswort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with harsh environmental conditions. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and borne in clusters, adding a subtle ornamental value. Herniaria bollei is well adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
