    "intro": "Hypochaeris achyrophorus, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are bright yellow and attract various pollinators. Hypochaeris achyrophorus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new areas."
