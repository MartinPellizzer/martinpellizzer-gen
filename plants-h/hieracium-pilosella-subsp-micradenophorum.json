    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. micradenophorum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets and a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as fruits. It is generally considered a non-invasive species but can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
