It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and deeply lobed, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
