    "intro": "Hieracium sublasiophorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers with a central disc. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. Hieracium sublasiophorum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
