    "intro": "Hakea oligomera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces cylindrical, red or yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea oligomera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in poor soils. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
