    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pedemontanum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial herb with a rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native range."
