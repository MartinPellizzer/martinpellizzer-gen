    "intro": "Hedychium griffithianum var. glanduligerum, commonly known as the glandular flame ginger, is a tropical perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, orange-red inflorescences that resemble torches, which are borne on long, branched stems. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, glandular pubescence, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers are not only visually appealing but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
