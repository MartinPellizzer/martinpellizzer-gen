    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. micradenium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, silver-haired leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single central flower head surrounded by leaf-like bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more delicate flower heads compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
