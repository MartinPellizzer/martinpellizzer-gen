It is characterized by its dense clusters of bright yellow, papery flowers that persist throughout the year, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its flowers are also used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature."
