    "intro": "Hypericum pustulosum, commonly known as the sticky St. John's wort, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, and its distinctive hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other members of the Hypericaceae family."
