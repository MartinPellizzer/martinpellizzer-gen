    "intro": "Helictotrichon decorum f. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, blue-green leaves that are covered in short, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, blue to purple flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens and wetland restoration projects."
