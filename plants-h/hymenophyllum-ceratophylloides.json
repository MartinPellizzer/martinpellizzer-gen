    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ceratophylloides, commonly known as the horned hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for dispersal. The plant's unique morphology and ecological niche make it an important component of forest ecosystems."
