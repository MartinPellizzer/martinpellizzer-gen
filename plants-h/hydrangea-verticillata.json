    "intro": "Hydrangea verticillata, commonly known as the mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant produces large, heart-shaped leaves that are dark green in summer and turn reddish in autumn. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Hydrangea verticillata is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its ornamental appeal throughout the growing season."
