    "intro": "Hampea macrocarpa, commonly known as the giant sphaerocarp, is a woody legume native to South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces spherical, woody fruits that enclose its seeds, a feature that distinguishes it from many other legumes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple leaflets arranged in a feathery pattern. Hampea macrocarpa is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
