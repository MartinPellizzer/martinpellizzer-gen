    "intro": "Hakea floribunda, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that appear in spring. The plant is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Its flowers are pollinated by birds and insects, and the plant produces woody, spine-tipped fruits. Hakea floribunda is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
