    "intro": "Hedysarum aureum, commonly known as golden peavine, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves and produces elongated, pea-like pods that contain small, edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Hedysarum aureum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
