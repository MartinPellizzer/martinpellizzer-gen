The plant belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is known for its unique morphology and limited distribution. It thrives in cool, moist environments, often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, Hemionitis albomarginata is considered a conservation concern."
