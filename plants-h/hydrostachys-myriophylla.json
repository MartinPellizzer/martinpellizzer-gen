    "intro": "Hydrostachys myriophylla, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of bright green, sword-shaped leaves that radiate outward from a central stem. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged, while the uppermost leaves may be partially or fully emergent. Hydrostachys myriophylla is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to help stabilize aquatic habitats."
