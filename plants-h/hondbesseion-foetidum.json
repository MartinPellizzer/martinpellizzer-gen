    "intro": "Hondbesseion foetidum, commonly known as the stinking honeysuckle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its fragrant, tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in shades of yellow or orange. The plant produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but often described as having a strong, unpleasant odor. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, with a rough texture and a distinct, sometimes aromatic scent. Hondbesseion foetidum is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal despite its pungent fragrance."
