    "intro": "Hepetis caricifolia, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in North America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in waterlogged soils, making it an important species in wetland ecosystems. Hepetis caricifolia is also notable for its role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its habitat."
