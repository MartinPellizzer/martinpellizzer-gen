It is characterized by its vibrant yellow to orange flowers, which resemble miniature sunflowers. The plant produces small, papery bracts that give it a fluffy appearance, often mistaken for actual flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum arussense is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
