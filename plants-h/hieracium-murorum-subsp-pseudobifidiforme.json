It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically lanceolate to ovate, with a rough, hairy texture. It is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is distinguished by its subtle morphological differences from other Hieracium species, particularly in the structure of its leaves and flower heads."
