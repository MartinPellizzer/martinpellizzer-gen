    "intro": "Hieracium villiceps, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Hieracium villiceps is often considered a weed but has ecological value as a food source for insects."
