    "intro": "Helictochloa pratensis subsp. amethystea, commonly known as the amethyst grass, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats such as meadows and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and glabrous, with a bluish-green color that becomes more prominent in the summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly reddish or purplish tinge in the inflorescences, giving it its amethyst-like appearance."
