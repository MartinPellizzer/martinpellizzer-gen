It features slender, upright stems that bear small, delicate white or pale blue flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, entire margin, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. This species is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support aquatic ecosystems."
