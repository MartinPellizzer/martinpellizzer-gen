    "intro": "Hemionitis minutula, commonly known as the small hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant prefers cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis minutula is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
