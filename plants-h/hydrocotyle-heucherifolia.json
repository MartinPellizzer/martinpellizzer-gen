    "intro": "Hydrocotyle heucherifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that float on the water's surface, with smaller leaves submerged underwater. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle heucherifolia is often found in ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams."
