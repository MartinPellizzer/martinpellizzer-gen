    "intro": "Hakea lativalvis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and thick, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Its flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich structure. Hakea lativalvis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in heathlands and open forests."
