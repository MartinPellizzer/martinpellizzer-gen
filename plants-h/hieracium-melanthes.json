    "intro": "Hieracium melanthes, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize various environments."
