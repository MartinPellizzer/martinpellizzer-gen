    "intro": "Helianthus gigas, commonly known as the giant sunflower, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its towering stature, often reaching heights of up to 10 feet, with large, yellow-orange composite flower heads. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. Its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which are bright yellow and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helianthus gigas is adapted to arid environments and thrives in full sunlight, making it a striking addition to xeriscaped gardens."
