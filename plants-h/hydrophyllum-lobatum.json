    "intro": "Hydrophyllum lobatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grasslands and open woodlands. Its blue or purple flowers bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hydrophyllum lobatum is adapted to arid conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils."
