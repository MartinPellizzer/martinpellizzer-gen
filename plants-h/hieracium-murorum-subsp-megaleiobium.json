    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. megaleiobium, commonly known as the large-leaved mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically broad and hairy, with a distinctive grayish-green color. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. This subspecies is often confused with other Hieracium species due to its similar appearance, but it can be distinguished by its larger leaves and specific habitat preferences."
