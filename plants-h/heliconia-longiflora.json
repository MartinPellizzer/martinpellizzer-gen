    "intro": "Heliconia longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers enclosed within the bracts, which are often used in floral arrangements. Heliconia longiflora thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique structure supports various pollinators, including birds and insects, making it an important part of its ecosystem."
