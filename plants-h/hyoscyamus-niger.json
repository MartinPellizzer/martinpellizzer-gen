    "intro": "Hyoscyamus niger, commonly known as black henbane, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual herb that grows up to 1 meter tall, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers that develop into dark, spherical berries containing toxic seeds. It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is known for its psychoactive properties due to the presence of tropane alkaloids. Hyoscyamus niger is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
