    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. spicatum, commonly known as the spicate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, and its flowering stems bear dense, spike-like clusters of yellow flowers. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
