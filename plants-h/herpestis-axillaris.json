    "intro": "Herpestis axillaris, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial that produces small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in dry environments. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Herpestis axillaris is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand drought and heat."
