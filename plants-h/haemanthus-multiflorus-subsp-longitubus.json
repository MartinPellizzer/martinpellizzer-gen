It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces striking, umbel-like clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its tuberous roots are adapted for storing nutrients and water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its elegant appearance."
