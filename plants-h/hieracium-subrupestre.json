    "intro": "Hieracium subrupestre, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs, slopes, and wastelands. The plant features upright stems with hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
