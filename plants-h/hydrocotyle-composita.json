    "intro": "Hydrocotyle composita, commonly known as the water shield, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features floating and submerged leaves that are typically rounded or heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize aquatic sediments and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Hydrocotyle composita is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes."
