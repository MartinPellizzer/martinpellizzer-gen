The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it has a low, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the summer months. Hieracium breviatum is known for its ability to colonize disturbed soils and is often considered an invasive species in certain regions."
