    "intro": "Hibiscus strigosus, commonly known as the woolly hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, or strigose, stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. Hibiscus strigosus typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, sunny conditions. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
