    "intro": "Hymenophyllum contextum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, moss-like fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum contextum is notable for its unique morphology and ecological adaptations to its native habitat."
