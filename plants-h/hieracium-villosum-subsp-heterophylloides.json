    "intro": "Hieracium villosum subsp. heterophylloides, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. Due to its variability in leaf shape, it is sometimes confused with other hawkweed species."
