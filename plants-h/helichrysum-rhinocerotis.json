    "intro": "Helichrysum rhinocerotis, commonly known as the rhinoceros bush, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
