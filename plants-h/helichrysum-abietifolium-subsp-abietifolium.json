    "intro": "Helichrysum abietifolium subsp. abietifolium, commonly known as the mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and its clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms."
