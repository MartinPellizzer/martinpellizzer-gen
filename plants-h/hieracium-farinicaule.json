    "intro": "Hieracium farinicaule, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are hairy and lance-shaped, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across various habitats."
