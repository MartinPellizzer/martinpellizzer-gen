    "intro": "Humboltia tridentata, commonly known as the three-toothed nightshade, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, dark green leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale purple, followed by bright red berries. Humboltia tridentata is adapted to arid and rocky environments, often found in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitats. It has been historically used by indigenous peoples for medicinal purposes."
