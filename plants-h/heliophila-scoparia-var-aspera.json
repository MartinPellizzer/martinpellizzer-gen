    "intro": "Heliophila scoparia var. aspera, commonly known as rough heliophila, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds. Heliophila scoparia var. aspera is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
