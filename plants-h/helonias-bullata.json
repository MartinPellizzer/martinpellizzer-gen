    "intro": "Helonias bullata, commonly known as the purple bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures that trap aquatic insects, allowing the plant to obtain nutrients from its nutrient-poor environment. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as marshes and ponds. Its leaves are submerged, while its stems and flowers rise above the water surface. Helonias bullata plays an important ecological role in aquatic ecosystems by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
