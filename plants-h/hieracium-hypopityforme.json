    "intro": "Hieracium hypopityforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and the leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
