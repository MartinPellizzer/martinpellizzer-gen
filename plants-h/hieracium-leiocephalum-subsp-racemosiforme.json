    "intro": "Hieracium leiocephalum subsp. racemosiforme, commonly known as the racemosiform hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, unbranched stem that bears a dense cluster of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
