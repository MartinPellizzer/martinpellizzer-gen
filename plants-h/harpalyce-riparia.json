    "intro": "Harpalyce riparia, commonly known as river harpalyce, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in wetland and riparian habitats. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows along riverbanks and in moist soils, contributing to the ecological stability of these environments. Harpalyce riparia is often used in restoration projects due to its ability to prevent erosion and support local biodiversity. Its seeds are adapted for dispersal by water, enhancing its role in riparian ecosystems."
