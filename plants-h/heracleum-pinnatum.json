    "intro": "Heracleum pinnatum, commonly known as the cow parsnip, is a tall biennial or short-lived perennial herb native to North America. It features a robust, hollow stem that is often covered with fine hairs, and its leaves are large, pinnately lobed, and have a distinctive silvery underside. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is known for its strong, often unpleasant odor. Heracleum pinnatum is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed sites."
