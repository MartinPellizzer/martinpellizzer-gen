    "intro": "Hieracium deltophylloides, commonly known as the broad-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It has a fibrous root system and can spread vegetatively through rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
