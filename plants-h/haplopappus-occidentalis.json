    "intro": "Haplopappus occidentalis, commonly known as the western pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces a fluffy, white pappus that aids in seed dispersal. Haplopappus occidentalis is often found in open grasslands and along the edges of deserts."
