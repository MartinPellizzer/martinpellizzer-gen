    "intro": "Hieracium tauschii subsp. austrosaxonicum, commonly known as the eastern hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
