    "intro": "Hibiscus sidiformis, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its broad, ovate leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming throughout the year in warm climates. Hibiscus sidiformis is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for tropical landscapes."
