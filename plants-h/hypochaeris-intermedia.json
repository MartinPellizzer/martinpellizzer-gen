    "intro": "Hypochaeris intermedia, commonly known as the common sowthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is an annual or biennial herb that grows up to 30 cm tall, featuring a hairy stem and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, which are typically visited by bees and other pollinators. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields. Hypochaeris intermedia is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has medicinal uses in traditional herbal remedies."
