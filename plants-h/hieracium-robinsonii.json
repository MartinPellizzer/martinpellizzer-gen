    "intro": "Hieracium robinsonii, commonly known as Robinson's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the United States, particularly found in the Great Basin and surrounding regions. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow to reddish flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
