    "intro": "Hedera arborea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf English ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features glossy, dark green, ovate leaves that are smaller than those of its parent species, Hedera arborea. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb walls and trees. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
