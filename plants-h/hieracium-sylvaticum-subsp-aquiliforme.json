    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. aquiliforme, commonly known as the aquatic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist or wet habitats such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. Its subspecies name, *aquiliforme*, refers to its bird-like shape, particularly the slender, elongated flower heads. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and is often found in riparian zones."
