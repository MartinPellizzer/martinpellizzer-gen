It features fleshy, blue-gray leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in dry conditions. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the summer months. It is often found growing in rocky soils or on slopes. Its compact growth habit makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
