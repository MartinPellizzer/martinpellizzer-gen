    "intro": "Hieracium eriopogon subsp. maladettae, commonly known as the Maladetta hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are covered in dense, white to greyish hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Compositae family. It thrives in rocky and gravelly soils, often in open, sunny habitats. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
