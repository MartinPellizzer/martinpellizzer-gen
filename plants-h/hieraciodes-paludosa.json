    "intro": "Hieraciodes paludosa, commonly known as the marsh hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated flower head made up of many small florets. Hieraciodes paludosa plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for wetland health."
