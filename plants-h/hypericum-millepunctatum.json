    "intro": "Hypericum millepunctatum, commonly known as the spotted St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and small, yellow flowers that bloom in midsummer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are woody and often branched. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in alpine and rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties have been historically valued, though it contains toxic compounds that require caution in use."
