    "intro": "Hedysarum pabulare var. rivulare, commonly known as the river peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and along riverbanks. Hedysarum pabulare var. rivulare plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its natural habitat."
