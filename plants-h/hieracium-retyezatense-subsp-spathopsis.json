    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. spathopsis, commonly known as the Alaskan hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the subarctic regions of North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, slender flowering stems. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single capitulum, which is surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as tundra and wet meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
