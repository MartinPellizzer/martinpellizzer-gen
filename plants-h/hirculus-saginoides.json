    "intro": "Hirculus saginoides, commonly known as the Alpine ibex, is a species of wild goat native to the mountainous regions of Europe and North Africa. This plant, however, does not exist; the term \"Hirculus saginoides\" refers to an animal, not a botanical species. Therefore, there are no botanical aspects to discuss. If you were referring to a plant, please provide the correct scientific name. I can't reply."
