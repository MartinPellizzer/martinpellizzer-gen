    "intro": "Hieracium similifolium, commonly known as the similar-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like structure. Hieracium similifolium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
