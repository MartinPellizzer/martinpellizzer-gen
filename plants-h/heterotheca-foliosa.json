    "intro": "Heterotheca foliosa, commonly known as the leafy goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Heterotheca foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
