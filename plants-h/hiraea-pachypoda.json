    "intro": "Hiraea pachypoda, commonly known as the thick-stemmed hiraea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
