    "intro": "Hippion pulchellum, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and invasive tendencies, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
