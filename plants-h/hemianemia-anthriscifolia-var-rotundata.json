    "intro": "Hemianemia anthriscifolia var. rotundata, commonly known as the round-leaved hemianthus, is a variant of the hemianthus genus within the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its rounded, lobed leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. It is native to parts of Europe and prefers moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream sides. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies in plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
