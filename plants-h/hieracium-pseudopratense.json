    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopratense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium pseudopratense is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
