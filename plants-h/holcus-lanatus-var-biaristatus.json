    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. biaristatus, commonly known as the silver hair veldtgrass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit. This plant is native to southern Africa and is often found in grassy habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The leaves are narrow and have a distinctive silvery sheen due to the presence of fine, soft hairs. It is a low-growing perennial grass that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun."
