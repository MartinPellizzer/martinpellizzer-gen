    "intro": "Halimium santae, commonly known as the Santalina rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, shrub-like structure. The plant produces showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Halimium santae is adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy species suited to Mediterranean climates."
