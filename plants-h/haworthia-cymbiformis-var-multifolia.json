    "intro": "Haworthia cymbiformis var. multifolia, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The leaves are typically short and thick, with a smooth, waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers on a tall stem during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance."
