    "intro": "Hieracium palmenii, commonly known as the palmleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of broad, dark green, palmately lobed leaves that resemble a palm leaf, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in late summer, which are composed of many tiny florets arranged in a disc. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
