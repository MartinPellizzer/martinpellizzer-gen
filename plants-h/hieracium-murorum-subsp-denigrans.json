    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. denigrans, commonly known as the black-centred hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed. The flowers are typically yellow, arranged in a composite head, and are surrounded by bracts that are often darker in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
