    "intro": "Hieracium petiolatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows up to 30 cm tall, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its rapid spread, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
