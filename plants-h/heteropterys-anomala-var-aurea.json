It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, golden-yellow hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The plant thrives in humid, shady environments and is often found in forest understories."
