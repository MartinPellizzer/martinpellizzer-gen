    "intro": "Henckelia pleuropogon, commonly known as the broad-leaved grass or mountain grass, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it forms dense mats or small clumps. Its flowering spikes are usually terminal, bearing small, pale green or brownish flowers that are wind-pollinated. Henckelia pleuropogon is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
