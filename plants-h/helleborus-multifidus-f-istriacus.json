    "intro": "Helleborus multifidus f. istriacus, commonly known as the Istrian hellebore, is a rare and striking plant native to the Istrian Peninsula of Croatia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and distinctive, showy flowers. The plant produces waxy, white to pale pink flowers with intricate, veined petals that bloom in early spring. It thrives in shaded, moist woodland environments and is known for its ornamental value and medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often cultivated in botanical gardens to preserve its genetic diversity."
