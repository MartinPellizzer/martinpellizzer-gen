    "intro": "Hebe brachysiphon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Hebe brachysiphon is well-suited to sunny to partially shaded conditions and is popular in rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental value."
