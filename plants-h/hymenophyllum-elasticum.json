    "intro": "Hymenophyllum elasticum, commonly known as the elastic hymenophyllum, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that can be stretched and then return to their original shape, giving it its common name. The plant has a compact growth habit with closely spaced, linear leaves that form a dense mat. Its spores are produced in small, clustered sori located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum elasticum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in humid forests."
