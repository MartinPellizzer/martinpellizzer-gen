    "intro": "Haplostephium, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a hollow, wind-dispersed seed stem called a pappus. The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa but has been naturalized in many parts of the world. Haplostephium typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found in gardens, roadsides, and meadows. Its yellow flowers bloom in spring and are followed by the characteristic white, fluffy seeds."
