    "intro": "Haplopappus inuloides var. linearis, commonly known as the linearleaf goatweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It features slender, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a basal rosette, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its flowering period usually occurs in the spring and early summer, and it is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. The species is characterized by its low-growing habit and drought tolerance, making it a common weed in arid landscapes."
