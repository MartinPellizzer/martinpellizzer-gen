    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. campylodon, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. It has basal leaves that are usually lance-shaped and hairy, with a tall, unbranched stem that bears a single flower head at the top. The flower head consists of yellow disk flowers surrounded by white to pale yellow ray flowers, making it visually distinct from other hawkweed species."
