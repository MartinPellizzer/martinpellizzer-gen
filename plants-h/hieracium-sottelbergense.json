    "intro": "Hieracium sottelbergense, commonly known as the Sottelberg hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to specific regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
