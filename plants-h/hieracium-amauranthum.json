    "intro": "Hieracium amauranthum, commonly known as the orange hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant features basal rosettes of spiny, hairy leaves and produces bright orange to yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated but can become invasive in certain environments."
