    "intro": "Hedera helix var. donerailensis, commonly known as the Donerailensis ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that exhibits distinct botanical characteristics. It is a climbing evergreen vine with dark green, lobed leaves that are typically broader than those of the standard Hedera helix. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. This variety is noted for its adaptability and resilience, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, decorative plant."
