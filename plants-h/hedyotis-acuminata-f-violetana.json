It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and clusters of tiny, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in forest understories. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This fern-like species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
