It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows and grasslands, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium distractifolium is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
