    "intro": "Hieracium anatonum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium anatonum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many environments."
