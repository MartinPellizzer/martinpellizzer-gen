    "intro": "Haageocereus pachystele, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces large, showy white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its succulent structure and nocturnal blooming habit are adaptations to its desert habitat. The plant's resilience and unique flowering pattern make it a notable example of xerophytic adaptation in cacti."
