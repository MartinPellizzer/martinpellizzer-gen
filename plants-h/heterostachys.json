    "intro": "Heterostachys, commonly known as the bottlebrush plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive inflorescences, which resemble bottle brushes due to their dense clusters of small, bright-colored flowers. Heterostachys species are typically shrubs or small trees, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The flowers are often bisexual, with tubular corollas that open into five lobes, facilitating pollination by insects or birds."
