    "intro": "Heisteria cauliflora, commonly known as the coral bells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 24 inches and produces showy, pink to red flowers that attract pollinators. Its foliage is finely textured and often displays a silvery-blue hue, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. Heisteria cauliflora thrives in partial to full shade and is well-suited for woodland gardens."
