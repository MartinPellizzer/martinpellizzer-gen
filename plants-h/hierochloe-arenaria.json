It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is often found in tundra and mountainous areas where few other plants can survive. Its ecological importance includes stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
