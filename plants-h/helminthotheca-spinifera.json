It is characterized by its dense, spiky foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found growing in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. Its seeds are small and wind-dispersed, aiding in its propagation along coastal areas. Helminthotheca spinifera is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience to salt and wind."
