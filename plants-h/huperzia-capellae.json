    "intro": "Huperzia capellae, commonly known as the Capella's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing rosettes of spore-bearing leaves, which are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the leaves, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Huperzia capellae plays a minor but ecologically significant role in its native habitats by contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for various invertebrates."
