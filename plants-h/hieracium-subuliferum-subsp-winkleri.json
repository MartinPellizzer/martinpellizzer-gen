    "intro": "Hieracium subuliferum subsp. winkleri, commonly known as the Winkler's slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and small, yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through its composite flower structure, which consists of numerous tiny florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
