    "intro": "Holodiscus discolor, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles. Holodiscus discolor is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
