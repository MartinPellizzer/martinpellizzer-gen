    "intro": "Habenaria aricaensis, commonly known as the Arica orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the coastal regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and slender, often hairy stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a loose raceme. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often in areas with high salinity due to its coastal habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
