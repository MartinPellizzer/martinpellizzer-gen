    "intro": "Henckelia sekayuensis, commonly known as the Sekayu henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the lowland rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an understory shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces small, spherical fruits that contain one or two seeds. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
