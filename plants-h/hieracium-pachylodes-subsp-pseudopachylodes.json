    "intro": "Hieracium pachylodes subsp. pseudopachylodes, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its large, hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellowish to orange-red composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
