    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodepilatum, commonly known as the false hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. It has a taproot system and is typically herbaceous, with a short life cycle. Due to its similarity to other hawkweeds, it can be challenging to distinguish without close examination."
