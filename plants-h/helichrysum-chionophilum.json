    "intro": "Helichrysum chionophilum, commonly known as the snow-loving immortelle, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features silver-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting appearance and aromatic scent."
