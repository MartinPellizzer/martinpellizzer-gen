    "intro": "Hypericum origanifolium var. depilatum, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairless stems and opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly aromatic. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-orange flowers in the summer, which are followed by orange-red seed capsules. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
