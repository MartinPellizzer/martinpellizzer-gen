    "intro": "Huernia zebrina, commonly known as the Zebra Cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in short, spiky tubercles and prominent white or yellow spines. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems. Huernia zebrina thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
