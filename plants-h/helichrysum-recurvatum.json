    "intro": "Helichrysum recurvatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in dense heads, giving it a fluffy appearance. Its foliage is usually grey-green and covered in fine, silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum recurvatum is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
