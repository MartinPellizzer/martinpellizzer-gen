    "intro": "Hedysarum boreale subsp. dasycarpum, commonly known as the northern peavine, is a perennial legume native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America and Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by inflated, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Hedysarum boreale subsp. dasycarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for herbivores in its native range."
