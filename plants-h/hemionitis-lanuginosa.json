    "intro": "Hemionitis lanuginosa, commonly known as the woolly hemionitis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures. Due to its unique morphology and ecological niche, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
