    "intro": "Hibiscus crenatus, commonly known as the serrated hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Hibiscus crenatus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often used in ornamental gardening for its vibrant blooms and is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
