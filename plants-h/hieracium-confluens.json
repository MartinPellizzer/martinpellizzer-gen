It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, and it is often found in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium confluens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural areas."
