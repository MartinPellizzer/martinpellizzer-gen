It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils. Its hairy stems and leaves are adapted to reduce water loss in dry conditions. The yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
