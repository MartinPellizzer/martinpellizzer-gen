    "intro": "Hippochaete \u00d7 meridionalis, commonly known as the hybrid dandelion, is a perennial herb native to South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, silver-green leaves and produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers that develop into fluffy white seeds. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. It has a taproot system and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
