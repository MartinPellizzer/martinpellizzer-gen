    "intro": "Hieracium stypodes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium stypodes is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
