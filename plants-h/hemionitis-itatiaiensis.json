    "intro": "Hemionitis itatiaiensis, commonly known as the Itatiaia fern, is a rare and unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of southern Brazil. It is characterized by its distinctive, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the shape of a lyre. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in cloud forests at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of its leaves, a common feature among ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis itatiaiensis is considered a vulnerable species."
