    "intro": "Habenaria sagittifera f. brachycentra, commonly known as the short-stalked arrowroot orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which are typically pollinated by specific insect species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in primary forest understories. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, this orchid is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
