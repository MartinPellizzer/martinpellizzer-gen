    "intro": "Helichrysum sordescens, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant produces papery, dry bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in floral arrangements."
