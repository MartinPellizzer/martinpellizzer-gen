    "intro": "Hieracium rubrisabinum, commonly known as the red-seeded hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, reddish-brown seeds in a tufted pappus. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
