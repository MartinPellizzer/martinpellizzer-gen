    "intro": "Helianthemum pergamaceum var. virescens, commonly known as the greenleaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, evergreen foliage with a bluish-gray hue, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in tight, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
