    "intro": "Hechtia minuta, commonly known as the miniature hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its compact growth habit and rosette-forming leaves. The plant produces small, colorful flowers that are typically borne on a short inflorescence. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a dense layer of trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hechtia minuta is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
