    "intro": "Hieracium stenotrichum, commonly known as the narrow-haired hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem. Hieracium stenotrichum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It is considered a weed in some agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habits."
