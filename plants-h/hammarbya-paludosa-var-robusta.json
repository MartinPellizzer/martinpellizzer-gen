    "intro": "Hammarbya paludosa var. robusta, commonly known as the robust marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features tall, erect stems that can reach up to 1 meter in height, covered with dense, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, typical of the Orchidaceae family. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in peat bogs and fens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
