    "intro": "Homalium caput-avis, commonly known as the \"bird's head\" or \"caput avis\" plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its compound leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
