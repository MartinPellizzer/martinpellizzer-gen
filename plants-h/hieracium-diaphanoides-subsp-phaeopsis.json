    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. phaeopsis, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow to orange flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies phaeopsis is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
