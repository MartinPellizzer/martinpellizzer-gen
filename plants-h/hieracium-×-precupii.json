    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 precupii, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces numerous small, seed-like structures called cypselae. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
