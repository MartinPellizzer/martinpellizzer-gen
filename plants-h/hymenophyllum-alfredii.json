    "intro": "Hymenophyllum alfredii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum alfredii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
