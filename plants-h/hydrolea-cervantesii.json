    "intro": "Hydrolea cervantesii, commonly known as the Cervantes's hydrolea, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a flowering plant characterized by its delicate, small leaves and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a compact growth habit and a short, fibrous root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
