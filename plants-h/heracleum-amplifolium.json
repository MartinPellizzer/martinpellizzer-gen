    "intro": "Heracleum amplifolium, commonly known as broadleaf cowparn, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a tall, herbaceous plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, featuring large, heart-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers that appear in late summer. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands and along riverbanks."
