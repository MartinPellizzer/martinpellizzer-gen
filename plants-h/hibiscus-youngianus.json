It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 3 meters tall, featuring large, showy flowers with five petals. The leaves are typically ovate or elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces bright yellow stamens and a five-lobed pistil, which contribute to its ornamental value.
