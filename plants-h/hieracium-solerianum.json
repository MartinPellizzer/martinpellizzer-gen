    "intro": "Hieracium solerianum, commonly known as the Solerian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head at the end of each stem. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. The plant has small, bract-like leaves that surround the flower head, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
