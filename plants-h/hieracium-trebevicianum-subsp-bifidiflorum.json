    "intro": "Hieracium trebevicianum subsp. bifidiflorum, commonly known as the bifid-flower hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers with a distinctive bifid (split) appearance in the florets. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands. It has lanceolate to ovate leaves with hairy surfaces and is often found in temperate regions of Europe. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
