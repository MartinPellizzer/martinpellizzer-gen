    "intro": "Humiria subcrenata, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland or marshy environments, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to aquatic conditions. Its showy, five-petaled flowers are typically pink or red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Humiria subcrenata plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various aquatic and semi-aquatic species."
