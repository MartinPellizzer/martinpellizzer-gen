    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. altissimus, commonly known as the tall meadowgrass, is a variant of the meadowgrass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial grass characterized by its tall, slender culms and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and pastures. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets. Its botanical features make it an important component of grassland ecosystems and a subject of study in plant ecology."
