It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are composed of many small florets arranged in a composite head. Hieracium myriadenum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
