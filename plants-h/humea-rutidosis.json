It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Humea rutidosis is often found in wetlands and disturbed soils, thriving in humid, tropical climates."
