It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Hieracium crepidopsis is typically perennial and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
