    "intro": "Haenianthus salicifolius var. parvifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, blue or violet flowers arranged in a compact cluster, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. This variety is closely related to other members of the genus Haenianthus, which are typically found in maritime environments."
