    "intro": "Hypericum galinum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from June to August. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are woody and often reddish in color. Hypericum galinum is often found in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and along roadsides, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
