It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate, hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by small, spiky fruits. Hypochaeris illyrica is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
