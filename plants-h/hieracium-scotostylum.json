It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and woodland edges, preferring moist, well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single flower head with ray florets and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium scotostylum is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of the British flora."
