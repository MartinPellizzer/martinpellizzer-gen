    "intro": "Harleyodendron unifoliolatum, commonly known as the single-leaf horse chestnut, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking, palmately compound leaves that are composed of a single, broad leaflet, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, white to pale pink flowers in spring, which are followed by spiny, orange-brown fruits. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and is of interest to plant scientists and horticulturists."
