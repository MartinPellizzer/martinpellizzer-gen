    "intro": "Hirtella glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, glandular hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a fragrant aroma, and it produces small, round berries that are edible. Hirtella glandulosa is often found in shaded understory environments, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
