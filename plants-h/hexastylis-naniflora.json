    "intro": "Hexastylis naniflora, commonly known as the tiny-stemmed hooded fern, is a small, delicate fern native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered, hooded spore cases. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are often covered in a dense mat of tiny, scale-like structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
