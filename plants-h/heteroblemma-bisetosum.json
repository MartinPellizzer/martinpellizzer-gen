    "intro": "Heteroblemma bisetosum, commonly known as the hairy bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, leafless stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant thrives in shallow, freshwater environments, often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are small and typically white or pale purple, arranged in a dense spike. Heteroblemma bisetosum is a carnivorous plant that relies on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
