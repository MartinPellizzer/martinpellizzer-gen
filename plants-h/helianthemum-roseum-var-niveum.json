    "intro": "Helianthemum roseum var. niveum, commonly known as the snow-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, often covered in a fine, silvery bloom. The plant has gray-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate appearance and hardy nature."
