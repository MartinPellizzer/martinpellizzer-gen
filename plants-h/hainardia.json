    "intro": "Hainardia, commonly known as the rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It consists of several species native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa. These plants are typically small shrubs or herbs with hairy stems and showy yellow or orange flowers. The leaves are usually narrow and sometimes glandular, and the flowers are arranged in dense, compact clusters. Hainardia species are adapted to arid and rocky environments, making them resilient to drought and poor soil conditions."
