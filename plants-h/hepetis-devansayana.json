    "intro": "Hepetis devansayana, commonly known as the Devansayana lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand cold and arid conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hepetis devansayana is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
