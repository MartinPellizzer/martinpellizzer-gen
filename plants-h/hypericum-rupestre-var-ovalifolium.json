    "intro": "Hypericum rupestre var. ovalifolium, commonly known as the oval-leaved St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its foliage is often covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
