    "intro": "Helleborus polychromus var. guttatus, commonly known as the spotted hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often marked with distinctive white or yellow spots. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
