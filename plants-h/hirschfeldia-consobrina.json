    "intro": "Hirschfeldia consobrina, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a small annual herb with slender, branching stems that often grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hirschfeldia consobrina is well-suited to sandy soils and is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats."
