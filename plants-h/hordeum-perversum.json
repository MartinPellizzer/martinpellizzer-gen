    "intro": "Hordeum perversum, commonly known as the wild barley, is a species of grass native to Eurasia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides or in fields. Its leaves are narrow and have a rough texture, while its seeds are small and oval in shape. Hordeum perversum is considered a weed in agricultural settings but has historical significance in the domestication of barley."
