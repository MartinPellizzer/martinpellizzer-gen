    "intro": "Heteranthera diversifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the water surface, while its rapid growth makes it an effective indicator of nutrient-rich waters. However, it can become invasive in certain aquatic environments if not managed properly."
