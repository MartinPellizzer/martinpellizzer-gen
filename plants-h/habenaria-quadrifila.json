    "intro": "Habenaria quadrifila, commonly known as the four-leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are linear and arranged in two rows along the stem, contributing to its unique appearance. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a delicately endangered species."
