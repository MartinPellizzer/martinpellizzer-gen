    "intro": "Hemionitis lutea, commonly known as the yellow hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, pale green fronds that are often covered in a thin layer of fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the undersides of the fronds, which are usually concealed beneath the foliage. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis lutea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
