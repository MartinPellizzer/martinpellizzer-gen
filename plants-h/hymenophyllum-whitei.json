    "intro": "Hymenophyllum whitei, commonly known as the white's filmy fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent, and often hair-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium. Hymenophyllum whitei plays a role in maintaining soil stability and moisture in its native habitats."
