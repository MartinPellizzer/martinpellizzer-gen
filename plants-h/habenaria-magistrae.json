    "intro": "Habenaria magistrae, commonly known as the noble lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and long, slender inflorescences that bear clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soil. Its flowers are often pollinated by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
