    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. minorifolium, commonly known as the small-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, evergreen foliage with silver-gray leaves that are typically smaller than those of the typical variety. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardens."
