    "intro": "Hedysarum portoricense, commonly known as the Portorican milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the island of Puerto Rico. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Hedysarum portoricense plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native ecosystem."
