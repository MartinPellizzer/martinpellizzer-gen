    "intro": "Hoya magniflora, commonly known as the giant wax plant, is a flowering vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can grow quite large. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya magniflora thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers warm, humid conditions. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
