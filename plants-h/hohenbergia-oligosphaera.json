    "intro": "Hohenbergia oligosphaera, commonly known as the \"Cushion Bromeliad,\" is a species native to Brazil. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact structure. The leaves are broad, stiff, and covered with a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a hairy appearance. It produces small, white flowers that emerge from the center of the rosette, often in late spring or early summer. This plant is well adapted to shady, humid environments and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its unique foliage."
