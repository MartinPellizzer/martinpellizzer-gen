    "intro": "Helenium microcephalum var. microcephalum, commonly known as the dwarf sunflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, orange to red-orange ray flowers with a yellow center, surrounded by a dense cluster of smaller, yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 12 to 18 inches, making it ideal for small gardens or containers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, producing its vibrant blooms from mid-summer to early fall. Its drought tolerance and ability to naturalize make it a low-maintenance addition to native plant gardens."
