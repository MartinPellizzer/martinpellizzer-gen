It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by yellow to orange ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often in rocky or gravelly soils. It has a compact growth form and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
