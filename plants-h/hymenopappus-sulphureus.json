    "intro": "Hymenopappus sulphureus, commonly known as the sulphur dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in early spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and produces a long, hairy stem that supports its flowering heads. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy or gravelly soils. Hymenopappus sulphureus is an important plant for pollinators and is adapted to withstand drought conditions."
