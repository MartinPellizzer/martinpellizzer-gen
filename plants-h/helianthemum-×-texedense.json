    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 texedense, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring and summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and long blooming period make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
