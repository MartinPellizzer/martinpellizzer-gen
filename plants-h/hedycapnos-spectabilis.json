    "intro": "Hedycapnos spectabilis, commonly known as the showy hedycapnos, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms. Hedycapnos spectabilis is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
