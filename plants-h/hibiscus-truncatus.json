    "intro": "Hibiscus truncatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and swamps, and thrives in moist, well-drained soil. Hibiscus truncatus is a perennial shrub that can reach heights of up to six feet, producing flowers throughout the summer months. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
