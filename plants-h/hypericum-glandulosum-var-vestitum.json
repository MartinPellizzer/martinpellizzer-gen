    "intro": "Hypericum glandulosum var. vestitum, commonly known as the hairy St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has slender, woody stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and also covered in a similar hairy texture. This variety is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands."
