    "intro": "Hieracium lerescheanum, commonly known as the Leresche's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in the form of composite heads. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in meadows and rocky soils. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
