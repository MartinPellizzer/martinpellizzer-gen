    "intro": "Haworthia cyanea var. ianthina, commonly known as the blue haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color, often with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
