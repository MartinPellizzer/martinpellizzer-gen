    "intro": "Hyalostemma, commonly known as the bluebell of the genus Hyalostemma, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Campanulaceae. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, often blue or violet flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Hyalostemma species are native to parts of Europe and Asia, where they thrive in shaded environments. Due to their ornamental value, some species are cultivated in gardens, though they are not widely known compared to other bluebell species."
