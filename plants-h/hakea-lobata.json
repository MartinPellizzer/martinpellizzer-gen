    "intro": "Hakea lobata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, leathery leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or urn-shaped flowers, typically in shades of yellow or red, which bloom in spring. Hakea lobata is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
