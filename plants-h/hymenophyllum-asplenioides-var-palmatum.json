    "intro": "Hymenophyllum asplenioides var. palmatum, commonly known as the Japanese rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the leaves and are protected by a membranous cover. It is native to Asia and is often found growing on rocks or tree trunks in moist, tropical forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
