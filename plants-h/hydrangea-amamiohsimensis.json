    "intro": "Hydrangea amamiohsimensis, commonly known as the Amami hydrangea, is a rare species native to the Amami Islands of Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy flower clusters that range in color from white to pink, depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its foliage consists of broad, ovate leaves with a smooth texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
