It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces red, berry-like fruits that persist into winter. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long blooming period."
