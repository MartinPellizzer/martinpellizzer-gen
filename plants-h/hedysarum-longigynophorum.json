    "intro": "Hedysarum longigynophorum, commonly known as the long-styled vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Hedysarum longigynophorum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in restoration ecology."
