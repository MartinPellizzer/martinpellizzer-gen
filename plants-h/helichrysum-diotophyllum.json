    "intro": "Helichrysum diotophyllum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are often clustered in dense heads, giving it a fluffy appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant's name reflects its long-lasting, dried appearance, as the flowers retain their color and form when dried."
