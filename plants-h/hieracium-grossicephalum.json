    "intro": "Hieracium grossicephalum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1 meter in height, with broadly lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and rough to the touch. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadside areas, and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
