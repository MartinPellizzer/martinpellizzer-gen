    "intro": "Himantochilus macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant water hyacinth, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, waxy, dark green leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water's surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats that can impact water flow and aquatic life. Due to its rapid growth rate, it is considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native habitat."
