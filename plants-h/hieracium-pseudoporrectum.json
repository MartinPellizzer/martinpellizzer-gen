    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoporrectum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of tubular florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It is typically found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
