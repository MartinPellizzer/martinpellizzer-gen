    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. chondrodes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its habitat."
