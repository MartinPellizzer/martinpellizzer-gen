    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. dichroum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has dark green, narrow leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, helping to reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
