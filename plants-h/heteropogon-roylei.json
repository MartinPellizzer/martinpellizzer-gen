It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Heteropogon roylei is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and its potential use in traditional medicine."
