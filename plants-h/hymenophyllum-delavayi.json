    "intro": "Hymenophyllum delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and release spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum delavayi is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
