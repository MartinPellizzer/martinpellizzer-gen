    "intro": "Hieracium penninum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium penninum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
