    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. tortifolium, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and hairy, with alternate leaves along the stem that are more elongated. Its yellow flowers are clustered in heads, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disc florets. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
