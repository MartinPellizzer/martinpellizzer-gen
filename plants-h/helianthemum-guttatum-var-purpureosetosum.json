    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. purpureosetosum, commonly known as the purple-hairy rockrose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, surrounded by hairy, glandular leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements make it a popular choice for xeriscaping. The distinctive purple-tinged stems and foliage add visual interest to garden settings."
