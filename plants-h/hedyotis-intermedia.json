    "intro": "Hedyotis intermedia, commonly known as the common marsh woundwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to moist habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often glandular-dotted. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Hedyotis intermedia thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other damp environments, making it an important component of aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
