    "intro": "Hakea rubriflora, commonly known as the red-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and striking red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces woody, cone-like structures called follicles, which contain the seeds. Hakea rubriflora is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features such as thick, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It plays an important role in the local ecosystem by providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
