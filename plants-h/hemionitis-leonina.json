    "intro": "Hemionitis leonina, commonly known as the lion's tail, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, clustered fronds that resemble a lion's tail, with long, slender pinnae that drape downward. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky crevices or shaded forest floors. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis leonina is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
