    "intro": "Hippocratea obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has strap-like leaves that are broad and pointed, often arranged in a basal rosette. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The orchid is also notable for its symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption."
