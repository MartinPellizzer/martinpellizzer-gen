It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil.
