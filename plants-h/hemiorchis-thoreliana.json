    "intro": "Hemiorchis thoreliana, commonly known as the Thorelian orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature a greenish-yellow color with red or purple markings. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Hemiorchis thoreliana is often found in humid, shaded environments, such as rainforests, where it thrives in the canopy layers."
