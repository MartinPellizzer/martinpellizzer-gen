It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in drought conditions. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss.
