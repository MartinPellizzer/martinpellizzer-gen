    "intro": "Hesperonia retrorsa, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, showy pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and thrives in full sun, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hesperonia retrorsa is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
