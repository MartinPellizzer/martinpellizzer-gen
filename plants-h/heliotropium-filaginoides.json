    "intro": "Heliotropium filaginoides, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing herbaceous perennial with prostrate or ascending stems that often form dense mats. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. Heliotropium filaginoides is adapted to sandy soils and can tolerate salt spray, making it a common species in coastal dunes and beaches."
