    "intro": "Hymenophyllum costaricanum, commonly known as the Costa Rican hymenophyllum, is a small, evergreen fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided, and often translucent fronds, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors and rock crevices, where it benefits from high humidity and indirect light. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering known as a indusium. Hymenophyllum costaricanum is native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica, and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
