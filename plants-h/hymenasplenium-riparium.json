    "intro": "Hymenasplenium riparium, commonly known as the river spleenwort, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, often submerged or partially submerged in water. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and slightly glossy. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Hymenasplenium riparium plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for microorganisms."
