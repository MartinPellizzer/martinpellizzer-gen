    "intro": "Hieracium vulgare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium vulgare is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
