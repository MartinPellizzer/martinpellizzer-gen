    "intro": "Hesperozygis ciliolata, commonly known as the silky centipede orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its unique, grass-like foliage and its striking, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is often found growing in sandy or gravelly soils along the edges of coastal dunes and cliffs. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is known for its intricate, tubular flowers that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
