    "intro": "Humata puberula, commonly known as the silky humata, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its hairy, soft leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of the genus Humata. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it remains relatively rare in horticulture."
