    "intro": "Helichrysum fruticosum, commonly known as the golden bush, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers. The plant has silvery-gray foliage, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helichrysum fruticosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its hardy and low-maintenance nature."
