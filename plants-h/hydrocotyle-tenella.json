    "intro": "Hydrocotyle tenella, commonly known as little water plant or marsh penny, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland areas in North America. It has distinctive, round, waxy leaves that are often floating on the water surface or partially submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in moist environments. Hydrocotyle tenella is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
