It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with a broad, rounded shape. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet or purple during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy floral displays."
