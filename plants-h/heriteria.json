    "intro": "Heriteria, commonly known as the \"scented everlasting\" or \"everlasting herb,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their compact growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. Heriteria species are native to southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, rocky soils and full sun. They produce small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting, fragrant blooms."
