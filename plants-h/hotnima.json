    "intro": "Hotnima, commonly known as the sacred flame plant, is a unique species native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking red and orange flowers that resemble flames, hence its common name. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Botanically, it belongs to the genus *Solanum* and is closely related to other nightshade plants."
