    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme, commonly known as the auricled hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, with ray florets that are often curved or auricled, giving it its common name. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Hieracium auriculiforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
