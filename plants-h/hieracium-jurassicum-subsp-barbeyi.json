    "intro": "Hieracium jurassicum subsp. barbeyi, commonly known as the Jurassic hawkweed, is a rare and distinctive member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. This subspecies is native to specific regions in Europe and is often found in dry, calcareous soils. Its morphology includes a robust stem with alternate leaves and a flowering period typically in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some areas."
