    "intro": "Haplopappus kingii, commonly known as the King's hairycup, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of western North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to drought conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Haplopappus kingii is often found in desert scrub and chaparral habitats, contributing to the ecological diversity of these environments."
