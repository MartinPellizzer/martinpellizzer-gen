    "intro": "Hymenocoleus nervopilosus var. nervopilosus, commonly known as the hairy-veined grass, is a species of grass native to South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is often bracted and appears at the tip of the stem. Its small, two-lobed flowers are typically green or reddish in color, and the plant produces small, three-nerved fruits. This grass is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun."
