    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. tauriscorum, commonly known as the Tauric hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Caucasus region. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It has a robust root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
