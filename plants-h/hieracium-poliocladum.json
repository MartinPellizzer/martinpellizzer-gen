    "intro": "Hieracium poliocladum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium poliocladum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
