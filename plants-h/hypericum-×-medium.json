    "intro": "Hypericum \u00d7 medium, commonly known as the hybrid St. John's wort, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and alternate, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in small, cone-like inflorescences. These flowers are composed of numerous tiny, tubular petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has a long history of use in traditional herbal medicine."
