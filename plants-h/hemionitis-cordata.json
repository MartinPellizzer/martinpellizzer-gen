    "intro": "Hemionitis cordata, commonly known as the mountain holly or holly fern, is a unique fern species native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen leaves that are divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its fronds are usually arranged in a compact rosette, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. Hemionitis cordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and greenhouses."
