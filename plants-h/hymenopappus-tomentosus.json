    "intro": "Hymenopappus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features hairy, gray-green foliage and produces yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a taproot system and is adapted to arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small florets surrounded by bracts, and it is often found in rocky soils and open plains. The species is notable for its soft, woolly appearance, which helps reduce water loss and protect against herbivory."
