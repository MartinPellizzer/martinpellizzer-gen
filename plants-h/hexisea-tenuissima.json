    "intro": "Hexisea tenuissima, commonly known as the slender sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, typically from August to October. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with short, stiff leaves that are covered in a fine layer of salt-tolerant hairs. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a notable species in coastal flora studies."
