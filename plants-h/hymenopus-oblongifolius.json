    "intro": "Hymenopus oblongifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leafed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, waxy coating. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often found in forest understories or near water sources. Hymenopus oblongifolius is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
