    "intro": "Hopea spicata, commonly known as the spiky hopea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including countries like Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. The plant is a medium-sized evergreen tree that can grow up to 30 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are small and clustered in spiky inflorescences, which give the plant its common name. Hopea spicata is valued for its hard, durable wood and is often found in lowland tropical rainforests."
