    "intro": "Humboltia ochreata, commonly known as the yellow lichen, is a type of lichen that forms a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a photosynthetic partner, typically a green alga or cyanobacterium. It is characterized by its yellow to orange-colored thallus, which is a composite structure formed by the combined growth of the fungal and algal components. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on tree bark or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Humboltia ochreata plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides habitat for various microorganisms. Its slow growth and unique appearance make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
