    "intro": "Hoya papuana, commonly known as the Papuan Waxplant, is a flowering plant native to Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya papuana is often grown as a houseplant due to its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and its ornamental value. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces."
