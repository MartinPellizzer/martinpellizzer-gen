    "intro": "Helenium brevifolium, commonly known as the short-leaved sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, bright orange to red ray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes and pond edges, and it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a distinctive short stature that gives it its common name. Helenium brevifolium is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
