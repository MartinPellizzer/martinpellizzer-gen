    "intro": "Hieracium rohacsense subsp. coazii, commonly known as the Roh\u00e1\u010d's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, inconspicuous florets arranged in a composite head. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
