It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by pale green bracts that give it a distinctive appearance. Hieracium deplumatum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes be invasive in certain areas."
