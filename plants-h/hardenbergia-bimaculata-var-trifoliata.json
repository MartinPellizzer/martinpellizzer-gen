    "intro": "Hardenbergia bimaculata var. trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf flax-lily, is a perennial herb native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces striking purple to violet flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
