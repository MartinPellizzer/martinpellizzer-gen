    "intro": "Hydrocotyle carrerae, commonly known as the Caribbean water pennywort, is a small aquatic plant native to the wetlands of the Caribbean region. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are usually floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, often appearing in green or yellowish clusters. Hydrocotyle carrerae plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
