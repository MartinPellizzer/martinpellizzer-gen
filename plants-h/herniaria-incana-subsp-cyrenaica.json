    "intro": "Herniaria incana subsp. cyrenaica, commonly known as the pale sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to thrive in poor soils make it well adapted to rocky and sandy habitats. Herniaria incana subsp. cyrenaica is often found in coastal dunes and dry steppe environments."
