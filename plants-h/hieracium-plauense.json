    "intro": "Hieracium plauense, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears numerous yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy leaves and stems, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. Hieracium plauense is often found in open habitats and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
