    "intro": "Halenia nivalis, commonly known as the snow halenia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. Its flowers are small, greenish-white, and clustered in terminal umbels, giving it a delicate appearance. Halenia nivalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and subtle floral display."
