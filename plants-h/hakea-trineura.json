    "intro": "Hakea trineura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea trineura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in dry conditions. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
