It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive rusty hue. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
