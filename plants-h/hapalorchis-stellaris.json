    "intro": "Hapalorchis stellaris, commonly known as the starry liver fluke, is a parasitic trematode belonging to the family Opisthorchiidae. It is primarily found in the bile ducts of its host, typically certain species of fish and mammals. The adult fluke has a distinctive, star-like appearance due to its branched, radiating structure. Its life cycle involves multiple hosts, including snails and freshwater fish, before reaching its definitive host. The plant-like appearance of the fluke is a key feature in its identification and classification."
