It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and long, slender, silky-hairy leaves. The plant typically grows in wet, open habitats such as marshes and along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose, cylindrical spikelet with short, awned flowers. The botanical features of this subvariety make it an important component of wetland ecosystems and a subject of study in grassland botany."
