    "intro": "Helianthemum alypoides, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is well adapted to rocky and limestone soils, thriving in full sun and cool, humid conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
