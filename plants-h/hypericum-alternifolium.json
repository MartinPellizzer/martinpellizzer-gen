    "intro": "Hypericum alternifolium, commonly known as the alternateleaf St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its narrow, alternate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in midsummer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and tundra environments. It contains hypericin and hyperforin, which are bioactive compounds with potential medicinal properties. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and specialized species in its native range."
