    "intro": "Hohenbergia ituberaensis, commonly known as the Itubera Bergia, is a species of flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late summer. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements. Hohenbergia ituberaensis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
