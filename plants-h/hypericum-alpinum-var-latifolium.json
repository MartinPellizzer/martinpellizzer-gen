It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
