    "intro": "Hieracium mespilifolium, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It is a perennial species that can form dense colonies, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is considered a weed in many regions."
