    "intro": "Hakea stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces striking, cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Hakea stenophylla is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
