    "intro": "Hieracium macilentum subsp. samoensicum, commonly known as the Samoan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Islands. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its botanical structure reflects its evolutionary adaptation to the tropical and subtropical climates of its native range."
