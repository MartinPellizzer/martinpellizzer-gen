    "intro": "Hieracium brevifolium subsp. congestifolium, commonly known as the dense-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem bearing yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, and the plant produces small, dandelion-like seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is notable for its dense foliage and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
