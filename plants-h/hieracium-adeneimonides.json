It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal and spoon-shaped, with a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium adeneimonides is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
