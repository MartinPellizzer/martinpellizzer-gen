    "intro": "Hypolepis dicksonioides, commonly known as the Dickson's shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant across the forest floor. The fronds are bioluminescent, a unique trait that aids in attracting certain insects for pollination."
