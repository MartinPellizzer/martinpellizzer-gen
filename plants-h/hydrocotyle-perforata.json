    "intro": "Hydrocotyle perforata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a floating aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, round, light green leaves that are often perforated, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are small and white, appearing in clusters, and it produces tiny, dark seeds that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle perforata plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
