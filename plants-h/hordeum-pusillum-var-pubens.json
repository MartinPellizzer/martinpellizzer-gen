    "intro": "Hordeum pusillum var. pubens, commonly known as the pubescent dwarf barley, is a small annual grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and hairy stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to yellowish flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often covered with fine pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often found in disturbed soils and can be an indicator species in certain ecological contexts."
