    "intro": "Hieracium neodivergens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are generally basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, often appearing in clusters."
