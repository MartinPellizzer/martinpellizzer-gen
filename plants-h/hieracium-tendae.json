    "intro": "Hieracium tendae, commonly known as the Tenda hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in early summer. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in non-native areas."
