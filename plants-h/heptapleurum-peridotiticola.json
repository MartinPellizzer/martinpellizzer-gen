    "intro": "Heptapleurum peridotiticola, commonly known as the peridotite heptapleurum, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the humid forests of southern China. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive peridotite-like green hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky or acidic soils. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, while its elliptical leaves are arranged in whorls around the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically unique species."
