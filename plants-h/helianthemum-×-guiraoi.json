    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 guiraoi, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a hybrid between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum hirsutum, resulting in a plant with distinctive characteristics from both parents. The species is native to the Iberian Peninsula and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. It produces showy yellow or orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it a popular choice for Mediterranean landscapes."
