    "intro": "Hirtella strigulosa, commonly known as the rough hirtella, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other well-known plants such as eucalyptus and clove. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture. It produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators like bees and birds. The fruit is a small, woody capsule that contains several seeds, typical of many species in the Myrtaceae family."
