    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosenile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open areas, such as roadsides and meadows. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium pseudosenile is an invasive species in some regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
