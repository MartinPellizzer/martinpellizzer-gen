    "intro": "Hoffmannseggella alvarenguensis, commonly known as the Alvar\u00e9nguensian fern, is a rare and endemic species found in specific microhabitats within the Azores. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 30 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered along the undersides of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
