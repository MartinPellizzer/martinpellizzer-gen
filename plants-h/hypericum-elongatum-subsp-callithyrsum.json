    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum subsp. callithyrsum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has simple, opposite, and often narrow leaves that are covered in fine hairs. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its medicinal properties, similar to other Hypericum species, have been historically used in herbal remedies."
