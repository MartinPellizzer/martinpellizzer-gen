    "intro": "Hedyotis cordata, commonly known as the heartleaf or heartleaf bittersweet, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves that give it its common name. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but often bitter. Hedyotis cordata is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
