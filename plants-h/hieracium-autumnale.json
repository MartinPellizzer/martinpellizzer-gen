    "intro": "Hieracium autumnale, commonly known as autumn hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn. Autumn hawkweed is often considered a weed due to its aggressive spreading habit."
