    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. sparsiceps, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and slender, hairy stems that bear alternate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a cluster at the tips of the stems, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in open grasslands or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
