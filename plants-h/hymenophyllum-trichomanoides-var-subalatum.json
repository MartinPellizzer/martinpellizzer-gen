    "intro": "Hymenophyllum trichomanoides var. subalatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a fern species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are covered in a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ability to retain moisture make it well adapted to its ecological niche. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage."
