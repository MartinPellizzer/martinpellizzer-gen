    "intro": "Hydrangea macrophylla f. cuspidata, commonly known as the pointedleaf hydrangea, is a cultivar characterized by its large, showy bracts that range in color from blue to pink depending on soil pH. It is a deciduous shrub native to Japan, known for its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to thrive in partial shade. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often obscured by the colorful bracts, which are actually modified leaves. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and is commonly used in landscaping for its ornamental value and seasonal color changes."
