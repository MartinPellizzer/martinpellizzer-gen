    "intro": "Hymenachne hemitoma, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hymenachne, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland habitats, including marshes and seasonally flooded areas. Hymenachne hemitoma is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
