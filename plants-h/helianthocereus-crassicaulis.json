    "intro": "Helianthocereus crassicaulis, commonly known as the thick-stemmed night bloomer, is a cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and clusters of white to pale yellow flowers that open at night. The plant produces small, red fruits that are edible and often used in traditional cuisine. It thrives in arid environments and requires minimal water, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Its nocturnal blooming habit is an intriguing botanical feature that aids in pollination by nocturnal insects."
