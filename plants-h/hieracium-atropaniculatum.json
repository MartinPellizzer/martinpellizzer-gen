    "intro": "Hieracium atropaniculatum, commonly known as the dark-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellowish-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant's inflorescence consists of both ray and disk florets, typical of the daisy family. It is often found in temperate climates and can spread through rhizomes or seeds, making it a common weed in certain habitats."
