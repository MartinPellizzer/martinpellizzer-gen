The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often branched. Helianthus pumilus thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in dry, rocky habitats."
