    "intro": "Hygrophila angustifolia var. saxatilis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in water gardens and wetland restoration projects."
