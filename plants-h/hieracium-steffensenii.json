    "intro": "Hieracium steffensenii, commonly known as the Steffensen's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. It has serrated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
