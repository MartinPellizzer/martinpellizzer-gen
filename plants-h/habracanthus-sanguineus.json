It belongs to the family Apocynaceae, which includes many plants with milky sap and showy flowers. The plant is characterized by its striking red petals and woody stems, which are typical of many species in its family. It typically grows in dry, arid environments and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. The flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds."
