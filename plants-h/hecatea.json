    "intro": "Hecatea, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, delicate appearance with pale greenish-white petals. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them, relying instead on air and rain for sustenance. Hecatea thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of dense forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a threatened species in its native range."
