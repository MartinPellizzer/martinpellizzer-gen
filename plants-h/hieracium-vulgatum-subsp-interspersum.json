    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. interspersum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, often with a hairy surface, and produces yellow flowers in clusters of 3 to 8. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is characterized by its showy, dandelion-like inflorescence. The subspecies interspersum is distinguished by its more robust growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to other subspecies of Hieracium vulgatum."
