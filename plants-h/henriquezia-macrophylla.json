It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting various pollinators. Its bark is thick and rugged, providing some protection against environmental stress.
