    "intro": "Hymenasplenium wangpeishanii, commonly known as the Wangpeishan holly fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lobed fronds that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth, where it can thrive in the dappled light. Its spores are dispersed by wind, and it reproduces through both sexual and asexual means. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
