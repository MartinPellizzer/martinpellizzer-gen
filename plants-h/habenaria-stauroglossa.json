It typically grows in moist, shaded forest understories, where it thrives in rich, humus-filled soil. The plant features a slender rhizome with erect, linear leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale green flowers with distinctive, star-shaped lip petals. Its flowering period occurs during the warmer months, and it is often found in montane and lowland habitats. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
