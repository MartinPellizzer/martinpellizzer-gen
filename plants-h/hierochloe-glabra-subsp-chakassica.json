    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hierochloe glabra subsp. chakakassica, commonly known as the Chakassian hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, silky blades and dense, tufted growth habit, which helps it thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological resilience, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
