    "intro": "Heliotropium drepanophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Heliotropium drepanophyllum is typically found in coastal areas and sandy soils, where it thrives in warm, humid climates."
