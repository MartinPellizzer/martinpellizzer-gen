    "intro": "Hieracium helictum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and alter local ecosystems."
