    "intro": "Habenaria epiphylla, commonly known as the epiphytic orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This plant is an epiphyte, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It typically has a pseudobulb and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, white, and purple. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining substrates for optimal growth. Its unique botanical features make it a popular choice for both horticultural and ecological studies."
