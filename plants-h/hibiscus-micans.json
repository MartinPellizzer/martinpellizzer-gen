    "intro": "Hibiscus micans, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a tropical plant native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, depending on the variety. Hibiscus micans thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and runners make it a common weed in agricultural settings."
