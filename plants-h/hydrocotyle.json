    "intro": "Hydrocotyle, commonly known as water pennywort, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. These plants are characterized by their heart-shaped leaves and small, white or yellowish flowers. They are typically aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, ponds, and slow-moving streams. Hydrocotyle species are known for their ability to thrive in moist environments and can spread rapidly through vegetative means. Their presence is often an indicator of healthy aquatic ecosystems."
