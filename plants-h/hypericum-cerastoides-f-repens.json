    "intro": "Hypericum cerastoides f. repens, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has thin, wiry stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread and form dense mats. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. This species is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils."
