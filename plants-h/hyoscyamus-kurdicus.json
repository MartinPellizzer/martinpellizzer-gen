It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking violet or purple flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. The plant contains various alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine, which have been historically used in medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic compounds. Its leaves are ovate and often have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and branching. Hyoscyamus kurdicus thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats."
