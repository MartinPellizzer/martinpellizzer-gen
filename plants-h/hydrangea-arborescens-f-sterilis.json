    "intro": "Hydrangea arborescens f. sterilis, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a sterile variant of the white hydrangea. It is characterized by its rounded, leafy growth habit and the absence of flowering, which is a result of its genetic makeup. The plant typically features large, serrated leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. This form is often used as a foliage plant due to its ornamental leaves and ability to form dense thickets."
