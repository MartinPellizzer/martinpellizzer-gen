    "intro": "Helichrysum melanacme, commonly known as the dark-stemmed everlasting. It is a flowering plant native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in dry, rocky environments. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
