It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily in suitable conditions. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and indoor spaces."
