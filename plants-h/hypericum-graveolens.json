    "intro": "Hypericum graveolens, commonly known as stinking hypericum, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval with a slightly hairy texture. The plant contains hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its medicinal properties and also contribute to its distinctive reddish-brown staining of the skin. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges and grassy areas. Due to its chemical composition, it has been used historically in herbal medicine for its purported antidepressant and antiseptic effects."
