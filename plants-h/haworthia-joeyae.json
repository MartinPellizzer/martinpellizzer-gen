    "intro": "Haworthia joeyae, commonly known as the Joey's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features short, fleshy leaves arranged in a rosette, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically green with white or pale blue markings, adding to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation."
