    "intro": "Hyalotricha, commonly known as the glassy hair or glassy hair fern, is a genus of ferns belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. These plants are characterized by their delicate, finely divided fronds that often appear translucent or glassy, especially when young. Hyalotricha species typically grow in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. Their rhizomes are wiry and often covered in a fine, hairy texture, which contributes to their common name. The spores are produced in small, clustered sori on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns."
