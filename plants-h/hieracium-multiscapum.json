    "intro": "Hieracium multiscapum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and multiple flowering stems that arise from a central rootstock. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically hairy and alternate along the stem, contributing to its common name. Hieracium multiscapum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
