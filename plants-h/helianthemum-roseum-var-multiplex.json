It features dense clusters of small, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and drought tolerance."
