    "intro": "Hedera aesculifolia, commonly known as the ivy-leaved ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed, resembling the leaves of the horse chestnut tree. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on walls or trees. Hedera aesculifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover surfaces in gardens and landscapes."
