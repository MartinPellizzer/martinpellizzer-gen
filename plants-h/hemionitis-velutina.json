    "intro": "Hemionitis velutina, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a unique plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is a member of the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a velvety appearance. The plant thrives in hot, dry environments and is adapted to survive with minimal water. Its leaves are clustered at the base, forming a compact rosette that helps reduce water loss. Hemionitis velutina is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
