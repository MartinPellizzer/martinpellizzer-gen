    "intro": "Hermannia dolomitica, commonly known as the rock hyssop, is a flowering plant native to the rocky regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Geraniaceae family and is characterized by its compact, evergreen shrub form. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or violet, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. Hermannia dolomitica thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in limestone formations. Its drought tolerance and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
