    "intro": "Hieracium britannicum var. subbritannicum, commonly known as the British hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and grasslands. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and is often found in calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its native range."
