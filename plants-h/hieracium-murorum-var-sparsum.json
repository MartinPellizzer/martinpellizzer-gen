    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. sparsum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and somewhat woody at the base. This variant is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other hawkweed species."
