    "intro": "Hieracium obesum, commonly known as the obese hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the top of its stem. Its flowers are typically tubular with five lobes and are pollinated by insects. Hieracium obesum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
