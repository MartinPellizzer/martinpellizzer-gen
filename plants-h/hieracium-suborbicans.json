    "intro": "Hieracium suborbicans, commonly known as the orbicular hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
