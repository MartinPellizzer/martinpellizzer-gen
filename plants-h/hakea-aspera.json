    "intro": "Hakea aspera, commonly known as the rough hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by cylindrical, woody fruits. Hakea aspera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in dry conditions. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
