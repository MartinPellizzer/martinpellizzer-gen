    "intro": "Hemiorchis harmandii, commonly known as the Harmand's orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and green. The plant has a unique structure with a single, elongated spur that extends from the base of the flower, a feature common in many orchid species. Hemiorchis harmandii thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
