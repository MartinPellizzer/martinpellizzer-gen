    "intro": "Hieracium megavulgatum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can form dense colonies, often in meadows and grasslands. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces a large number of seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
