    "intro": "Hierochloe helenae, commonly known as Helen's hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its fine, hair-like leaves and compact growth habit, typically forming dense, low-growing tussocks. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, spikelet-based flowers. Hierochloe helenae is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in high-altitude habitats."
