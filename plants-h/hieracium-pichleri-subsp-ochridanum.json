    "intro": "Hieracium pichleri subsp. ochridanum, commonly known as the Ochridan hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a dense cluster of disk florets. Native to the Balkan Peninsula, it thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant is relatively small, typically reaching heights of 10\u201330 cm, and has a compact growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
