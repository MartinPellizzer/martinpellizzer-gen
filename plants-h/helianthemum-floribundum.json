It features dense clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are adapted to withstand drought and poor soil conditions. It thrives in full sun and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it an excellent choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
