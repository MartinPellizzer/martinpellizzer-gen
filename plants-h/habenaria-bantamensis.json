    "intro": "Habenaria bantamensis, commonly known as the Bantam orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and delicate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
