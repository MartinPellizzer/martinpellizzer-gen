    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 grohii var. farwellii, commonly known as the Farwell's hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are usually hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
