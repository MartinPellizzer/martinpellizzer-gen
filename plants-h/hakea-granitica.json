    "intro": "Hakea granitica, commonly known as the granite hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink in color, which appear in late winter to early spring. Hakea granitica is adapted to grow in sandy or gravelly soils, often in areas with high sunlight exposure. It is also known for its ability to thrive in coastal environments, making it a resilient and hardy species."
