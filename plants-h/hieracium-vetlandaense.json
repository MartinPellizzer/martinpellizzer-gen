It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
