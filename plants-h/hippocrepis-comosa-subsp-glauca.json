    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa subsp. glauca, commonly known as the blue bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-gray underside that gives the plant its subspecies name, *glauca*. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands or rocky habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
