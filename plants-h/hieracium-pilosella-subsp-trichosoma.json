    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. trichosoma, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence. The plant typically grows in dry grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. It is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and medicinal properties in some species."
