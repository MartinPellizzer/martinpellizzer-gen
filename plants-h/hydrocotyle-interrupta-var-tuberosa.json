    "intro": "Hydrocotyle interrupta var. tuberosa, commonly known as the tuberous water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in shallow water. The tuberous roots are an important feature, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing aquatic sediments."
