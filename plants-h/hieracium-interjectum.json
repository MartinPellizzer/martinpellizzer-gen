    "intro": "Hieracium interjectum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium interjectum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new sites."
