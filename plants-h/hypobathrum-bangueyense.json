    "intro": "Hypobathrum bangueyense, commonly known as the Bangueyense fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the tropical rainforests of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires high humidity to flourish. Its small, inconspicuous spore-producing structures are located on the underside of its leaves. Due to habitat loss, Hypobathrum bangueyense is considered a critically endangered species."
