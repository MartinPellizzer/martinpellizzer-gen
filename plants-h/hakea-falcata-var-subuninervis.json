    "intro": "Hakea falcata var. subuninervis, commonly known as the narrow-veined hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, red-brown flower spikes that bloom in late winter to early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and drought tolerance make it well adapted to the harsh, dry environments of its native range. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of veins in the leaves compared to other hakea species."
