It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate, hairy leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
