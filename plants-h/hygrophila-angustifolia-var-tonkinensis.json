    "intro": "Hygrophila angustifolia var. tonkinensis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hygrophila, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 cm wide, arranged oppositely along its stem. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often emerging from the water surface. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams, and is often used in aquascaping due to its ornamental value. Its rapid growth rate makes it a popular choice for water gardeners seeking to control algae growth."
