It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, two-ranked flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along waterways. Its adaptability makes it an important component of many wetland ecosystems."
