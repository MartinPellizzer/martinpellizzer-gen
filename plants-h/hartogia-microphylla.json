It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, narrow leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in mild climates."
