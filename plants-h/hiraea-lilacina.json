    "intro": "Hiraea lilacina, commonly known as the lilac-flowered iris, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands and marshy areas of eastern North America. It features striking violet to lilac-colored flowers that bloom in early summer, typically from June to July. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that grow in dense clusters at the base, and its rhizomatous root system helps it thrive in moist soils. Hiraea lilacina is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators. It is also sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies for its purported medicinal properties."
