    "intro": "Hydnophytum camporum, commonly known as the sticky root vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique root system, which forms a symbiotic relationship with ants, providing them with shelter and nectar in exchange for protection. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are typically alternate, ovate, and have a glossy surface. Hydnophytum camporum is valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
