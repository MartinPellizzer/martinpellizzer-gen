    "intro": "Hippeastrum carneum, commonly known as the red dragon orchid, is a striking bulbous plant native to South America. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a cluster of strap-shaped leaves that emerge from a fleshy bulb, which stores nutrients for flowering. Its flowers are typically trumpet-shaped with a spurred lip, and they emit a sweet, spicy fragrance. Hippeastrum carneum is popular as a ornamental plant due to its vibrant blooms and relatively easy care requirements."
