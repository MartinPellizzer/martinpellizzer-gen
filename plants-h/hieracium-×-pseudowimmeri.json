It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that resemble dandelions. The plant produces yellow flowers with ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
