    "intro": "Hedera arborea intermedia, commonly known as the European ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly wavy margin and can grow both as a ground cover or a climbing plant. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a popular garden plant and an invasive species in some regions."
