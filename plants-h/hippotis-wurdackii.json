    "intro": "Hippotis wurdackii, commonly known as the Wurdack's bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant is typically found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It is a carnivorous plant, relying on the nutrients obtained from captured prey to supplement its nutrient intake. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its native range."
