    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. flavescens, commonly known as the lesser cowparsnip, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences composed of small white to greenish flowers. The plant produces smooth, elongated fruits that are typically yellow or greenish in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its foliage has a distinctive, somewhat peppery scent when crushed, which is a common feature among plants in the Apiaceae family."
