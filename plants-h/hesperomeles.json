    "intro": "Hesperomeles, commonly known as the mistletoe of the genus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Loranthaceae. These plants are hemiparasitic, meaning they derive some nutrients from their host trees while also performing photosynthesis. Hesperomeles species are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, often growing on the branches of other plants. Their small, often fragrant flowers are usually white or yellow, and they produce small, fleshy berries. The genus includes several species, some of which are used in traditional medicine."
