    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. schroeterianum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lanceolate, rough to the touch, and often have a bluish-gray hue due to dense pubescence. The flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds."
