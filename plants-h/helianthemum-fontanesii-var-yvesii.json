    "intro": "Helianthemum fontanesii var. yvesii, commonly known as the Yves' rockrose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardy nature in Mediterranean climates."
