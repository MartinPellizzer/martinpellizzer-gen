    "intro": "Hieracium habromorphum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the daisy family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium habromorphum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
