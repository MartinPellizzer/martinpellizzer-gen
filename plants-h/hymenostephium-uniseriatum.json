    "intro": "Hymenostephium uniseriatum, commonly known as the single-row hymenostephium, is a rare and unusual member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a single row of stamens, which is a distinctive trait among orchids. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in tropical or subtropical regions. Its flowers are small and delicate, with a complex arrangement of petals and sepals that contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging species for cultivation."
