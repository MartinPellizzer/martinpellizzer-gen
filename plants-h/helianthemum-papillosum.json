    "intro": "Helianthemum papillosum, commonly known as the prickly sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its flowers are typically arranged in clusters and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's hairy stems and leaves provide protection against water loss and herbivory."
