    "intro": "Hieracium subadhalsicum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and elongated stems that bear yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, disc-shaped flower heads. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
