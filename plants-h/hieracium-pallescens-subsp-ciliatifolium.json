    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. ciliatifolium, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are softly hairy and have ciliate margins, giving it its subspecies name. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in a single head, with ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets. It is characterized by its slender stem and is often found in disturbed or marginal environments."
