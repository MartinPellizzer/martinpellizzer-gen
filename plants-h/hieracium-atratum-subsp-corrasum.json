    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. corrasum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellowish to brownish flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky soils. It produces small, disc-shaped flowers that are clustered in a single head, and it is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor environments. The subspecies corrasum is distinguished by its slightly smaller stature and more compact growth compared to other members of the species."
