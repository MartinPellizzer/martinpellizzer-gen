    "intro": "Hakea glabella subsp. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate hakea, is a low-growing shrub native to southwestern Australia. It features needle-like leaves that are typically grey-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The subspecies is distinguished by its prostrate or creeping form, which differs from the more upright growth of the main species."
