    "intro": "Hieracium solum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its roots form a dense network that aids in soil stabilization. Hieracium solum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
