    "intro": "Hedera canariensis, commonly known as Canary ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, shiny leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by black, spherical berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its rapid growth habit makes it both a popular and potentially invasive species in certain regions."
