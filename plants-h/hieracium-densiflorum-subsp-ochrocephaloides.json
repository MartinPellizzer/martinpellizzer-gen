It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces a dense inflorescence of yellow flowers with ray florets, blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly yellowish flower heads compared to other Hieracium species."
