    "intro": "Hieracium averianum, commonly known as the Russian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy, rough stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces achenes (small, dry fruits) that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium averianum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
