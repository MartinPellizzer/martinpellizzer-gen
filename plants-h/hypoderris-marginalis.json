    "intro": "Hypoderris marginalis, commonly known as the coastal fern, is a species native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant features delicate, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, with spores produced in clusters on the undersides of the fronds. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species in its native range."
