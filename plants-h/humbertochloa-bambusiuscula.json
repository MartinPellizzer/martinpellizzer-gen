    "intro": "Humbertochloa bambusiuscula, commonly known as the bamboo grass, is a member of the Poaceae family, characterized by its grass-like structure and fibrous growth habit. This plant is native to tropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and forest edges. It typically grows as a clump-forming perennial with slender, arching stems that bear narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually wind-pollinated. Its fibrous stems make it a potential candidate for use in erosion control and as a source of biomass."
