    "intro": "Hedyotis serpyllacea, commonly known as common tormentil, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that bear small, yellowish-green leaves arranged in a rosette. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or reddish in color, followed by small, bead-like fruits. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands, rocky soils, and disturbed areas. Hedyotis serpyllacea is often used in traditional medicine and has been studied for its potential antioxidant properties."
