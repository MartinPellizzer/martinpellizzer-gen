    "intro": "Hackelia revoluta f. ovatifolia, commonly known as the ovate-leaved honeysuckle, is a compact, flowering shrub native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, ovate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its vibrant, long-lasting blooms."
