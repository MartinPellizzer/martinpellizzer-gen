    "intro": "Helianthemum papillare, commonly known as the papillate rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a low-growing shrub with small, fleshy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its scientific name reflects the papillate (bumpy) texture of its leaves, a distinctive botanical feature. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
