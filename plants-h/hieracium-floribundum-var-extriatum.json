    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum var. extriatum, commonly known as the Showy Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow-orange flowers with ray florets and is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
