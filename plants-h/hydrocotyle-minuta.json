    "intro": "Hydrocotyle minuta, commonly known as little water shield, is a small aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow water, wetlands, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are usually less than 1 inch in diameter. Its flowers are small and white, often appearing in clusters, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Hydrocotyle minuta plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water filtration."
