It belongs to the Araceae family and is characterized by its arrow-shaped leaves and striking inflorescence. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions. It produces small, white flowers surrounded by a green spathe, which is typical of the Araceae family. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
