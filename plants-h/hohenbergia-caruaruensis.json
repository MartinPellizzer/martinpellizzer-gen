    "intro": "Hohenbergia caruaruensis, commonly known as the Caruaru bromeliad, is a species native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect water. The plant produces striking inflorescences with vibrant, long-lasting flowers that range from red to orange. Its foliage is often covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Hohenbergia caruaruensis is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low light requirements and ability to thrive in humid environments."
