    "intro": "Hieracium cerussatiforme, commonly known as the lead-colored hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive, slightly hairy involucre. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various conditions."
