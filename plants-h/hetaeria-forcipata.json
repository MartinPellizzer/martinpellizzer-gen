    "intro": "Hetaeria forcipata, commonly known as the horned liverworts, is a type of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, leafy structures and is typically found in moist, shaded environments. The plant has a thalloid body, which is a flat, ribbon-like structure that serves as the primary photosynthetic organ. Hetaeria forcipata is often seen growing on rocks or soil in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, called gametangia, are located on the upper surface of the thallus."
