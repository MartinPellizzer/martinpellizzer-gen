    "intro": "Helianthemum origanifolium f. leiocladum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rockrose, is a compact evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color and densely packed, giving the plant a dense, mat-like appearance. The flowers are usually pink or reddish, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, sunny conditions due to its drought tolerance. Its foliage provides year-round interest, making it a valuable addition to Mediterranean-style landscapes."
