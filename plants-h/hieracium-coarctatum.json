    "intro": "Hieracium coarctatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow, forming dense clusters at the top of the plant. Hieracium coarctatum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
