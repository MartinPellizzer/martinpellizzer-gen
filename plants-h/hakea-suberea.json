    "intro": "Hakea suberea, commonly known as the rigid hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by cylindrical, woody seed pods. Hakea suberea is adapted to arid environments and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for dryland gardens. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important species in its native habitat."
