It features basal rosettes of elongated, fleshy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in a single terminal head, which is a characteristic feature of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in grasslands and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a mild, slightly bitter taste, making it a potential forage plant for both humans and livestock."
