    "intro": "Hydrobryum stellatum, commonly known as the star-leaf marsh plant, is a small, herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, white or greenish flowers in late summer. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Hydrobryum stellatum is an indicator species for healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
