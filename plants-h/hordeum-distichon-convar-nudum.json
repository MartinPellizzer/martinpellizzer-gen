    "intro": "Hordeum distichon convar. nudum, commonly known as the slender wild barley, is a grass species characterized by its erect, slender stems and narrow, linear leaves. It produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two rows of florets, typical of the Hordeum genus. The plant is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its seeds are small and three-angled, with a distinctive hilum, and it is adapted to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. This species plays a role in both ecological systems and has been used in agricultural research due to its genetic diversity."
