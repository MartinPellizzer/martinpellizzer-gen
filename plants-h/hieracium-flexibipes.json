    "intro": "Hieracium flexibipes, commonly known as the flexible hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disk of tubular florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands across northern Europe and parts of Asia. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its adaptability, it is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
