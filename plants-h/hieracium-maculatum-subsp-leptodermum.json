    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. leptodermum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often reddish or purplish in color. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from June to September. Its leaves and stems are covered in fine, soft hairs, which help reduce water loss in drier conditions. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
