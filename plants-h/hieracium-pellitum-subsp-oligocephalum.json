It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features slender, upright stems with spiny leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering heads are yellow and are composed of many small, tubular florets. This subspecies is characterized by its reduced capitula, which are smaller and more compact compared to other Hieracium species."
