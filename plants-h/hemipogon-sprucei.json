    "intro": "Hemipogon sprucei, commonly known as the Spruce's hemipogon, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its hairy, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds. Hemipogon sprucei is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
