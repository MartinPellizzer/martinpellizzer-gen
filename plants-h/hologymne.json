    "intro": "Hologymne, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is an epiphytic orchid, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. The plant is characterized by its lack of leaves and its striking, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom once a year. Hologymne thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires a specific combination of moisture and light to survive. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is protected in many regions."
