    "intro": "Hedyotis villosa, commonly known as the hairy buttonweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Australia. It features small, clustered white flowers that bloom throughout the year, and its leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands. Hedyotis villosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature. It plays a role in supporting local insect populations and contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats."
