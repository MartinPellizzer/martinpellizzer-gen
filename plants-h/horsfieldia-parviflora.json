    "intro": "Horsfieldia parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. Horsfieldia parviflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate under the right conditions."
