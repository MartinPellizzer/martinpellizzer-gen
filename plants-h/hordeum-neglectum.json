    "intro": "Hordeum neglectum, commonly known as wild barley, is a species of grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. The plant typically thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Its seeds are often dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Hordeum neglectum is also of interest in ecological studies due to its role in soil stabilization and as a potential forage crop."
