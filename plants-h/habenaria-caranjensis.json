    "intro": "Habenaria caranjensis, commonly known as the Caranji orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, particularly South Africa. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its erect, leafy stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter or early spring, producing clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grassland or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
