It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
