    "intro": "Hakea cagiana, commonly known as the Christmas Hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant produces small, bright red flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid or semi-arid habitat. Hakea cagiana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience to coastal conditions."
