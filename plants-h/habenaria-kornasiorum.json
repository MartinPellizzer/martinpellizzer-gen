    "intro": "Habenaria kornasiorum, commonly known as the Kornasiorum orchid, is a species of orchid native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and a single, showy flower that typically blooms in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and its roots are adapted for epiphytic growth on trees. The orchid's flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinctive lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. It requires specific humidity and light conditions to thrive, making it a challenging but rewarding plant for cultivation."
