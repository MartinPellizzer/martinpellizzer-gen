    "intro": "Hedyotis wrightii, commonly known as Wright's pennywort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically features small, opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, which help stabilize soil in wetland environments. Hedyotis wrightii is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and swampy regions."
