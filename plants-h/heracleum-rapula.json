    "intro": "Heracleum rapula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils across temperate regions of Europe and Asia. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and finely divided, fern-like leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. Its small white to greenish flowers appear in umbrella-shaped clusters, attracting various pollinators. The roots are often used in traditional medicine, though the plant can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
