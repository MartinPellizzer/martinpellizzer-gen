It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant has heart-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It is characterized by its robust root system and ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is often found in association with other woodland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of its habitat."
