    "intro": "Hoya keysii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a striking epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves that are often variegated with shades of pink, white, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, adding to its ornamental appeal. Hoya keysii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively easy care make it a popular choice among indoor gardeners."
