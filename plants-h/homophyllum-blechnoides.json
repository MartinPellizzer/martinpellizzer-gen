    "intro": "Homophyllum blechnoides, commonly known as the narrow fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, linear fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. The plant's structure and growth habit make it a unique example of epiphytic and lithophytic ferns."
