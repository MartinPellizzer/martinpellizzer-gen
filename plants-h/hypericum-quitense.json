    "intro": "Hypericum quitense, commonly known as the Andean St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or mountainous areas. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with prominent stamens, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. Its leaves are opposite and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. Hypericum quitense is adapted to harsh climates and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
