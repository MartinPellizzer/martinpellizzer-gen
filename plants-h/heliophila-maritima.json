    "intro": "Heliophila maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its spiky, blue or purple flowers and silver-green foliage, which help it thrive in salty, windy environments. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shorelines. It has a short growing season and is often found in maritime habitats. Heliophila maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal dunes."
