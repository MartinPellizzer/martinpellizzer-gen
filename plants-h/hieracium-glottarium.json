It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other parts of the world and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant is perennial and can form dense colonies, which can sometimes be invasive. Its botanical features make it a common sight in meadows and along roadsides."
