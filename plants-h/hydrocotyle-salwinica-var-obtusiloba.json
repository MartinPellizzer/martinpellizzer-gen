    "intro": "Hydrocotyle salwinica var. obtusiloba, commonly known as the broad-leaf water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. The plant features a rosette of heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often floating or submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. Its small, white flowers bloom in clusters, adding a delicate floral display to its aquatic habitat. This variant is distinguished by its obtuse leaf lobes, which set it apart from other varieties within the Hydrocotyle genus."
