    "intro": "Herniaria zervudachii, commonly known as the Armenian carpetweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Caucasus region. It features small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces tiny white or pinkish flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
