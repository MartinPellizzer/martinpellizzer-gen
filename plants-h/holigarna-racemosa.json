    "intro": "Holigarna racemosa, commonly known as the clustered grassvetch, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Holigarna racemosa plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
