It is characterized by its large, broad, dark green leaves that can reach up to 30 inches in length. The plant produces tall, upright stems with fragrant, white to pale blue flowers in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden areas. Its ornamental value comes from both its foliage and its showy floral display."
