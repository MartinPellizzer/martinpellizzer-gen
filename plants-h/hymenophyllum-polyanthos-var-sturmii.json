    "intro": "Hymenophyllum polyanthos var. sturmii, commonly known as the Sturm's filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a thin, membranous cover. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
