    "intro": "Hieracium arranense, commonly known as the Arran hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles, particularly the Isle of Arran. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats and has dark green, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium arranense is considered a rare and vulnerable species, often found in specific microhabitats on the Isle of Arran."
