    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. stenogonium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. Its flowers are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and smaller, more compact flower heads compared to other hawkweed species."
