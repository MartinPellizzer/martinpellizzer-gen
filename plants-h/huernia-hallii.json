    "intro": "Huernia hallii, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems covered in a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically during the warmer months. Its unique, horn-like tubercles give it a distinctive appearance. Huernia hallii is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal watering to thrive."
