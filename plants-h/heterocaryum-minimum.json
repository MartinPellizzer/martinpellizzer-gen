    "intro": "Heterocaryum minimum, commonly known as the dwarf false sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its botanical features include a prostrate growth habit and the ability to form dense mats, which help it survive in harsh conditions. Heterocaryum minimum is often found in alpine tundra and is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to extreme climates."
