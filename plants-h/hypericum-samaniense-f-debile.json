It belongs to the Hypericaceae family and is characterized by its reduced growth habit compared to the typical species. The plant features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are narrow and linear. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and fragile nature, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
