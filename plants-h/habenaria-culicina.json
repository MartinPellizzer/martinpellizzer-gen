    "intro": "Habenaria culicina, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are typically arranged in a dense spike. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Habenaria culicina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
