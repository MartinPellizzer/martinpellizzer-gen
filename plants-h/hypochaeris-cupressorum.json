    "intro": "Hypochaeris cupressorum, commonly known as the creeping cinquefoil, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has a mat-forming habit, with hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that help it thrive in dry, disturbed soils. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas where it can spread rapidly. The species is characterized by its ability to form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and a valuable source of nectar for pollinators."
