    "intro": "Heliophila decurva, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, spreading stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. Its flowers are small, bell-shaped, and usually blue or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Heliophila decurva is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in wetland restoration projects."
