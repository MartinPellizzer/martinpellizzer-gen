    "intro": "Habenaria fulva, commonly known as the golden twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to various regions in Asia and North America. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or other plants without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
