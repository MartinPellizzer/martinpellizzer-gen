It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often in clusters at the ends of its stems. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Hieracium phaeum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in certain regions."
