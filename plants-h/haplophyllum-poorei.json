It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
