    "intro": "Hibbertia serpyllifolia var. minutifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves and yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as coastal dunes or heathlands. It is a low-growing shrub with a compact form, and its flowers attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The variety minutifolia is distinguished by its smaller leaves compared to the typical form of Hibbertia serpyllifolia."
