    "intro": "Horsfieldia canarioides, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial herb with a short, stocky rhizome and produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The flowers are usually pollinated by insects, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture."
