    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum f. cyrenaicum, commonly known as the Cyrenaic sandthrift, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from April to May. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid or semi-arid habitats. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas or dry grasslands. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a suitable plant for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
