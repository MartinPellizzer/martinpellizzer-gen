    "intro": "Habenaria trapezoidea, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, zigzag-shaped inflorescence and strikingly colored flowers that often feature a combination of red, yellow, and white. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as tropical forests, and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in water retention. The orchid is known for its delicate, fragrant blooms that appear during the warm season."
