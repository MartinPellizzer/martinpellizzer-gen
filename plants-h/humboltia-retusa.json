It is a climbing vine characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Humboltia retusa thrives in coastal environments, often growing along cliffs and in sandy soils.
