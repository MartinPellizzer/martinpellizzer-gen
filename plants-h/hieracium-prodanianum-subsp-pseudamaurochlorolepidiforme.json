    "intro": "Hieracium prodanianum subsp. pseudamaurochlorolepidiforme, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers and has a rosette-forming growth habit. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower heads. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in certain regions."
