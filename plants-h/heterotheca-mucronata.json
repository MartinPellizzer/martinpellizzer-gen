    "intro": "Heterotheca mucronata, commonly known as the narrowleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to the central and southeastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in prairies, open woods, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a rough, hairy texture, and it produces seeds in small, disk-like structures. Heterotheca mucronata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
