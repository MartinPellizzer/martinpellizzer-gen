It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, erect stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has hairy foliage and produces small, disk-like flowers that attract pollinators. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting insect life and its resilience in marginal environments."
