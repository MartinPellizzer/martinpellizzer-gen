It is an annual herb that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, featuring hairy stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens.
