    "intro": "Huperzia eversa, commonly known as the evergreen huperzia, is a species of fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and needle-like, evergreen leaves that remain throughout the year. Native to various regions in Asia, including China and Japan, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant's spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are located on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia eversa is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
