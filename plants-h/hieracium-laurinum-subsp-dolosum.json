    "intro": "Hieracium laurinum subsp. dolosum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appearance and ability to naturalize, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
