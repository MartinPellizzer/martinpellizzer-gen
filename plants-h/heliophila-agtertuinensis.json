    "intro": "Heliophila agtertuinensis, commonly known as the Agtertuin's sunflower, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South Africa. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sunlight. Its flowers, which range from white to pale yellow, bloom in late summer and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heliophila agtertuinensis is considered a vulnerable species."
