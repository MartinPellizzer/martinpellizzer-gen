    "intro": "Helianthemum ledifolium f. spicatum, commonly known as the spiky rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
