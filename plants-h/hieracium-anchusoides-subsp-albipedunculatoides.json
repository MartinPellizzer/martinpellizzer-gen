It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, elongated inflorescence, which is distinctive for its pale peduncles. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its specialized habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
