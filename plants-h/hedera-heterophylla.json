It is characterized by its variable leaf shape, which can range from heart-shaped to arrowhead-like depending on the environment. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that are often lobed or notched, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by orange berries. Hedera heterophylla thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forests or along rocky outcrops. Its adaptability to different light conditions makes it a versatile plant in both natural and cultivated settings."
