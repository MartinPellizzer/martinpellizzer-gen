    "intro": "Hannafordia, commonly known as the New Zealand flax, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Asphodelaceae and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, strap-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color. Hannafordia species are often found in coastal and wetland environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. They have been used traditionally by M\u0101ori for their strong fibers, which were woven into baskets and other crafts."
