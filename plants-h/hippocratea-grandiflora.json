    "intro": "Hippocratea grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered hippocratea, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red in color. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, round seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of tropical forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
