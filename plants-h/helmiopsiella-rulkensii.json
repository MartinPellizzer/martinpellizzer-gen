    "intro": "Helmiopsiella rulkensii, commonly known as the Rulkens' helmiopsiella, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its small, clustered inflorescences and finely divided, aromatic foliage. Native to specific regions in Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, dry fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
