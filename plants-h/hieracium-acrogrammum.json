    "intro": "Hieracium acrogrammum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and is native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with flowering stems that bear clusters of small, yellow flowers. Hieracium acrogrammum is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
