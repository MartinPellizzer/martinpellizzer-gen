    "intro": "Hohenbergia, commonly known as the star orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Bromeliaceae. These plants are native to South America, particularly Brazil, and are characterized by their rosette-shaped leaves that form a cup-like structure to collect rainwater. The leaves are typically thick and fleshy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Hohenbergia species produce showy, spike-like inflorescences with small, colorful flowers that bloom in shades of red, orange, and yellow. They are popular as ornamental plants due to their striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
