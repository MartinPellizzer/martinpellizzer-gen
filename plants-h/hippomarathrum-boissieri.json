It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy, with small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. It blooms from spring to early summer, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
