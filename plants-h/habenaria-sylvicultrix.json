    "intro": "Habenaria sylvicultrix, commonly known as the forest orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia, including China, Japan, and the Korean Peninsula. It typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often on decaying wood or in leaf litter. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip that is characteristic of the Orchidaceae family. Its roots are mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
