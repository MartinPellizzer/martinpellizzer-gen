    "intro": "Heliotropium saxatile, commonly known as the rock heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the Mediterranean and parts of Africa. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are succulent and fleshy, adapted to store water in its native dry environment. Heliotropium saxatile is often found growing on limestone or sandy soils, and it is well-suited to coastal and maritime climates."
