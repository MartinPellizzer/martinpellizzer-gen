    "intro": "Huperzia hoffmannii, commonly known as the Hoffmann's spikemoss, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a low-growing evergreen plant characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves and strobiliferous cones. Native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes. The plant's structure includes a rhizome from which both leaves and sporophytes arise. Huperzia hoffmannii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
