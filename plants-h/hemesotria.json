    "intro": "Hemesotria, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, reddish-brown wood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. Due to overharvesting, Hemesotria is now classified as an endangered species."
