    "intro": "Hymenophyllum surinamense, commonly known as the Surinam moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical rainforests. Its leaves are covered with a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures that aid in water retention. This species is notable for its unique reproductive structures, which are borne on the underside of its fronds."
