    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. hololeucum, commonly known as the white-flowered sandthrift, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. This variety is notable for its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
