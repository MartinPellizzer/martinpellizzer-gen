    "intro": "Hedeoma stenodonta, commonly known as narrowleaf hedeoma, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow to white flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils along streambanks and in open woodlands. Hedeoma stenodonta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local pollinator populations."
