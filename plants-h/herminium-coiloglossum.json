    "intro": "Herminium coiloglossum, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
