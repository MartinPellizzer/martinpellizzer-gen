It features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The plant is characterized by its tubular flowers, which are typically arranged in a dense inflorescence. It thrives in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
