    "intro": "Hypericum paniculatum, commonly known as the panicled St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small, five-petaled flowers. Its botanical features include glandular dots on the stems and leaves, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in natural habitats."
