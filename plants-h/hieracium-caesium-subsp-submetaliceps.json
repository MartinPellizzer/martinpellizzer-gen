    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. submetaliceps, commonly known as the silverleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a basal rosette of silver- or gray-hairy leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its yellow flowers are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and the species is known for its robust growth habit. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows."
