    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. vaellistense, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant features yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disc florets. Its leaves are basal, lanceolate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh mountain environments. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for alpine pollinators."
