    "intro": "Hieracium procerulum, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by pale yellow to white ray florets. Hieracium procerulum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
