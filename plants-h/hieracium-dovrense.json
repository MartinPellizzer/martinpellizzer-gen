    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense, commonly known as the Dovrense hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and tall, slender flowering stems that bear yellowish to reddish composite flowers. Native to southern Europe, it thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. It is often found in disturbed areas and is considered a pioneer species in ecological succession."
