    "intro": "Hemistephus, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The plants are characterized by their erect or decumbent growth habit and produce showy, often pink or purple, pea-like flowers. Hemistephus species typically have compound leaves and are adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are valued for their ornamental appeal in dry gardens."
