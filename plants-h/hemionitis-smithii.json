    "intro": "Hemionitis smithii, commonly known as the Smith's hemionitis, is a rare and distinctive fern native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its unique, fan-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of silky, white hairs. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically found in rocky or forested areas at high altitudes. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis smithii is considered a vulnerable species."
