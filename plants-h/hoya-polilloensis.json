    "intro": "Hoya polilloensis, commonly known as the Polillo Wanda, is a rare species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, glossy leaves. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya polilloensis is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to thrive. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
