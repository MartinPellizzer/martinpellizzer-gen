    "intro": "Haworthia nortieri var. nortieri, commonly known as the Nortier's Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green in color with white to pale yellow markings. The leaves are arranged in a rosette pattern and are often adorned with translucent windows, a characteristic feature of many Haworthia species. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its drought tolerance and minimal care requirements."
