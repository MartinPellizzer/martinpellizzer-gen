    "intro": "Hedypnois arenaria, commonly known as the sand sparrowgrass, is a low-growing perennial plant native to sandy and coastal environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, arid conditions. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor itself in loose, shifting sands. Hedypnois arenaria plays a role in stabilizing dunes and preventing erosion in coastal regions."
