    "intro": "Hiraea singularis, commonly known as the rare moonflower of the Andes, is a striking plant characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is native to high-altitude regions of South America. The plant features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces small, green berries that mature to a deep red. Due to its limited habitat and specific ecological requirements, it is considered endangered. Its unique flowering behavior and ornamental value make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists alike."
