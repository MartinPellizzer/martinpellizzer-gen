    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. pseudophyllobracteum, commonly known as the false leaf bract hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy, basal leaves that are often mistaken for true leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique bract structures that resemble leaves, giving it its common name. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. This plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in some areas."
