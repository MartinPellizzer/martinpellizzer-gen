    "intro": "Helichrysum tenuiculum, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers that are often used in dried flower arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has silver-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Helichrysum tenuiculum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
