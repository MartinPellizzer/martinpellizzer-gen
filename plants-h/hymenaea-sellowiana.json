    "intro": "Hymenaea sellowiana, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large evergreen tree native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its thick, ridged bark and compound leaves with long, narrow leaflets. The tree produces large, woody pods that contain the edible Brazil nuts. Its flowers are small and yellowish-green, typically arranged in clusters. The plant is valued not only for its nuts but also for its role in the ecosystem and traditional uses by indigenous communities."
