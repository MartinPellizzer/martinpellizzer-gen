    "intro": "Hieracium retyezatense subsp. glaucosinuosifrons, commonly known as the glaucous-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves that are typically glaucous in appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a single, terminal capitulum, which is surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
