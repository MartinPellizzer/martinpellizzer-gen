    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. elegans, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, velvety fronds that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a soft, moss-like appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in temperate rainforests. Its fronds are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, with intricate, feather-like divisions. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in humid, shaded garden settings."
