    "intro": "Hakea caleyi, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces spikes of small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance through its deep root system. Hakea caleyi is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soils."
