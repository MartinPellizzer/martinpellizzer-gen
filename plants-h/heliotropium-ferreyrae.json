    "intro": "Heliotropium ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, and it is often found in coastal regions. Its flowers bloom in clusters and are known to open in response to sunlight, a trait that gives the genus its common name."
