    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum subsp. ruficomum, commonly known as the red-stemmed rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has wiry, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, giving it its common name. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly areas."
