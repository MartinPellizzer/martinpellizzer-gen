    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor var. xanthacanthus, commonly known as the yellow-spined night bloomer, is a cacti species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in white to yellow spines, which provide protection from herbivores and intense sunlight. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white, pink, or purple. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and nocturnal blooming habit make it a striking addition to desert gardens."
