    "intro": "Habenaria foliosa var. gibsonii, commonly known as the Gibson's feather orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and a flowering spike that bears numerous small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests or under dense vegetation. Its roots form a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with appropriate humidity and light conditions."
