    "intro": "Hieracium pinicola, commonly known as the pine hill hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, forest edges, and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and occur in dense clusters, forming a characteristic \"hawkweed\" appearance. Hieracium pinicola is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
