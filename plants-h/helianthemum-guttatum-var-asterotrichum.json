    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. asterotrichum, commonly known as the star-haired stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, star-shaped yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
