    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. laceridens, commonly known as the lacerate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape, with serrated margins. Its flowers are yellow, clustered in dense inflorescences, and are borne on slender, leafless stems. The subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf lobes that are often deeply notched or lacerated, giving it its common name."
