    "intro": "Hedysarum horridum, commonly known as the bristly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in dry, rocky soils. Hedysarum horridum is often found in sagebrush steppe and other arid environments."
