    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum var. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited rockrose, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by large, showy red or orange fruits. Its leaves are usually grayish-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
