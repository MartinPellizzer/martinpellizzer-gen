    "intro": "Hypericum undulatum var. rotundifolium, commonly known as the rounded-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the eastern United States. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has alternate, oval-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the base, giving it its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and wetlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
