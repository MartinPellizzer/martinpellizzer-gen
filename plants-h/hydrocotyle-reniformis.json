    "intro": "Hydrocotyle reniformis, commonly known as marsh mallow or broadleaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It has heart-shaped, floating leaves that are typically 2\u20135 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in umbels. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize wetlands. Hydrocotyle reniformis thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds, lakes, and marshes."
