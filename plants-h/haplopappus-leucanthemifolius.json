    "intro": "Haplopappus leucanthemifolius, commonly known as the white-flowered pappus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves and produces small, white to yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique botanical features include a reduced pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal. Haplopappus leucanthemifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid environments."
