    "intro": "Heracleum voroschilovii, commonly known as the Voroschilov's cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescence. It is a tall herbaceous plant, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces small white flowers arranged in complex umbels, which are typical of the carrot family. Its hairy stems and leaves are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. Native to Central Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
