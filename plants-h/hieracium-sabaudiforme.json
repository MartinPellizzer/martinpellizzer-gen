    "intro": "Hieracium sabaudiforme, commonly known as the Sabaudian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive lobed shape, and its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits."
