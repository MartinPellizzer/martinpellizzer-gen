    "intro": "Habenaria zothecina, commonly known as the zigzag orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and striking, often fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, aiding in its survival in seasonal environments. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. The orchid blooms during the wet season, relying on specific pollinators for reproduction."
