    "intro": "Heterocondylus didymus, commonly known as the double-lobed fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. The plant's unique morphology and ecological adaptations make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
