    "intro": "Hugonia foliosa, commonly known as the water hibiscus, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces striking yellow flowers with red centers, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in marshes and ponds. Hugonia foliosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
