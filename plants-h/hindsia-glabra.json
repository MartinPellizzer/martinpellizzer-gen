    "intro": "Hindsia glabra, commonly known as the smooth hindsia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with smooth, glabrous bark. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy texture, while its flowers bloom in clusters and are pollinated by insects. Hindsia glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
