    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. stolzenbergense, commonly known as the Stolzenberg hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flower heads that are typically clustered in a single stem. The plant is native to central and southern Europe and is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is generally short-lived and has a limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
