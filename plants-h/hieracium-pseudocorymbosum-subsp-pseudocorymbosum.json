    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocorymbosum subsp. pseudocorymbosum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves and produces a single stem that bears a dense cluster of small, daisy-like flowers. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it spreads primarily through rhizomes and seeds. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
