    "intro": "Huperzia rubrica, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a member of the family Huperziaceae. It is a perennial evergreen plant characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, scale-like leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cone-like formations at the tips of its branches. Huperzia rubrica is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
