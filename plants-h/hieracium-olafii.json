    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion olafii, commonly known as Olaf's Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that resemble dandelion petals, and it produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. Hieracium olafii is a perennial herb that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem."
