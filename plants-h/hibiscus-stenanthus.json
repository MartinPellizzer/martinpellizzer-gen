    "intro": "Hibiscus stenanthus, commonly known as the narrowleaf rosemallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wetlands and along stream banks. The plant features showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. Hibiscus stenanthus plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
