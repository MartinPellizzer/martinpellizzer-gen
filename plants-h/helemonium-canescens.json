It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats.
