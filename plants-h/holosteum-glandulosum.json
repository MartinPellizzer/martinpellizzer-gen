    "intro": "Holosteum glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and opposite leaves that are often glandular and covered in fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are usually oval to lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Holosteum glandulosum is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the understory vegetation."
