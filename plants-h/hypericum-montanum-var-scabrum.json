    "intro": "Hypericum montanum var. scabrum, commonly known as rough St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves and flowers contain hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its traditional medicinal uses. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and rocky habitats."
