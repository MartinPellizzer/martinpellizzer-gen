It is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It has a deep taproot system that allows it to survive in dry, sandy soils. Haumaniastrum goetzei is adapted to extreme temperatures and is often found in desert environments."
