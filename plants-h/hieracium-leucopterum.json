It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive whitish or yellowish underside, contributing to its ornamental appeal. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
