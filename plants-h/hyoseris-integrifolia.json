    "intro": "Hyoseris integrifolia, commonly known as the smoothleaf ironweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and wet meadows. Its leaves are entire, meaning they have no teeth or lobes, and are arranged oppositely along the stem. The showy purple to pink flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
