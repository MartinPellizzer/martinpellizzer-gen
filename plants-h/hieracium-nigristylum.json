It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its dark green, hairy stems and yellow-orange composite flowers make it easily identifiable.
