    "intro": "Hedysarum alii, commonly known as the alpine vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three small, heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum alii thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
