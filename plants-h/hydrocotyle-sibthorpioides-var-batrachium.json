    "intro": "Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides var. batrachium, commonly known as the frog's eye plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, rounded, waxy leaves that resemble frog eyes, hence its common name. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. The leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
