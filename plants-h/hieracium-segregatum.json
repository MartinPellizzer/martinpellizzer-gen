    "intro": "Hieracium segregatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium segregatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
