It features a thick, ribbed stem that stores water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers during the warmer months. Its leaves are fleshy and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Huernia occellata is popular among cactus and succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
