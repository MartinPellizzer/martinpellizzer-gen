    "intro": "Hypericum elodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a semi-aquatic perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, ponds, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged in water. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a slightly waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Small yellow flowers appear in late summer, producing abundant nectar that attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
