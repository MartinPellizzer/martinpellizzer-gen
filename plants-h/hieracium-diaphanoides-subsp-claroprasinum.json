    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. claroprasinum, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its finely divided, hairy leaves and yellow flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its flowers are composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets, which attract various pollinators. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
