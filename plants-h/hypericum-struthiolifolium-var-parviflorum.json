It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers with four petals. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting flowers."
