    "intro": "Howardia pubescens, commonly known as the woolly rock melon, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems and leaves covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange or red berries. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular ornamental plant in dry climates."
