    "intro": "Halgania preissiana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that are often surrounded by pale green bracts, giving it a bell-like appearance. Halgania preissiana is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments, with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
