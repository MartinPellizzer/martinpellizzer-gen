    "intro": "Hedysarum radiatum, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Hedysarum radiatum is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has been used historically in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
