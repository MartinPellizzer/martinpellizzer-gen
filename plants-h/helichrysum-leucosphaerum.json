    "intro": "Helichrysum leucosphaerum, commonly known as the white globe everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescences composed of small, white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant produces numerous tiny, tubular disc florets that are typically hidden within the central part of the flower head. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value lies in its long-lasting, drought-resistant flowers that retain their color and shape for extended periods."
