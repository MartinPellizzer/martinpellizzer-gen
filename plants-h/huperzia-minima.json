    "intro": "Huperzia minima, commonly known as the dwarf huperzia, is a small, evergreen fern that belongs to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and features tiny, linear leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. Native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Its fronds are usually dark green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Huperzia minima is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and ease of care."
