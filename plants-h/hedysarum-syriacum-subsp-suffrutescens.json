    "intro": "Hedysarum syriacum subsp. suffrutescens, commonly known as Syrian vetch, is a low-growing, thorny shrub native to the Middle East and Central Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces yellow to orange pea-like flowers. The plant has a woody stem that becomes more branched and dense with age, contributing to its shrub-like appearance. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky or sandy soils. The subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and is sometimes used in traditional landscaping or as a cover plant in dry regions."
