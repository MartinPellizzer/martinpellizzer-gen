    "intro": "Hieracium tomentatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white tomentum, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium tomentatum is known for its ornamental value but can also be considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
