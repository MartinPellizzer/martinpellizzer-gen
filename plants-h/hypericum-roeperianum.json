    "intro": "Hypericum roeperianum, commonly known as the roeper's St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, leathery leaves that are dark green and arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long flowering period."
