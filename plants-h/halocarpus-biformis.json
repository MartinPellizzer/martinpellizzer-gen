    "intro": "Halocarpus biformis, commonly known as the silver pine, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-gray bark and needle-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant is adapted to coastal and sandy soils, showing resistance to salt spray and wind. It produces small, cone-like structures that contain its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Halocarpus biformis plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
