    "intro": "Haworthia obtusa f. acuminata, commonly known as the pointed Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are short and pointed, giving the plant its common name. It produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
