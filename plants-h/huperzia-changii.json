    "intro": "Huperzia changii, commonly known as the Chinese huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant is native to Southeast Asia, including regions such as China, India, and Thailand. Huperzia changii thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves, a typical feature of ferns."
