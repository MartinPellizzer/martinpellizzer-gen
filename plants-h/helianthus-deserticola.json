    "intro": "Helianthus deserticola, commonly known as the desert sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as deserts and rocky soils. The plant produces yellow flowers with radiating petals and a central disk, similar to other members of the sunflower family. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in hot, dry conditions. Helianthus deserticola is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and can withstand periods of drought."
