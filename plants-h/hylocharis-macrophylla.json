    "intro": "Hylocharis macrophylla, commonly known as the giant hylocharis, is a striking plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, often displaying vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, typically at elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters. Its leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in the arid and cold conditions of its habitat. Hylocharis macrophylla plays an important ecological role by attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
