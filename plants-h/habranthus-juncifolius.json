    "intro": "Habranthus juncifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or wetlands. Its flowers bloom in late summer and early fall, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it prefers specific soil and moisture conditions to thrive."
