It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow flowers and distinctive, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are usually covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture."
