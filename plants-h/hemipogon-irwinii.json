    "intro": "Hemipogon irwinii, commonly known as the Irwin's ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, delicate flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, with white petals and sepals and a yellow lip. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in pine flatwoods and wetlands. It has a symbiotic relationship with specific mycorrhizal fungi, which are essential for its nutrient uptake. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a critically endangered species."
