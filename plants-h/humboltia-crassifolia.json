    "intro": "Humboltia crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically bright yellow or orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Humboltia crassifolia is also valued for its ability to withstand drought conditions, making it a resilient addition to xeriscaped landscapes."
