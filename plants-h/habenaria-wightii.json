It is a terrestrial orchid with a distinctive inflorescence that often features a single, showy flower. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually broad and strap-like, and the flower has a unique structure with a spurred lip. The orchid's pollination is often facilitated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
