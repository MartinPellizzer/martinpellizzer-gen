    "intro": "Homalolepis salubris, commonly known as the smooth leaved cycad, is a species of cycad native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnately compound leaves that are smooth and glossy. The plant produces cycad-like cones, with male and female structures typically found on separate plants. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
