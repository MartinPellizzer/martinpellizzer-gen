    "intro": "Hedysarum ulutavicum, commonly known as the Ulutav mountain vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, which are followed by slender, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs. Hedysarum ulutavicum plays a role in stabilizing soil and is part of the broader Hedysarum genus, which includes several other species of vetches."
