    "intro": "Helichrysum leucophyllum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, yellow to orange-colored flowers that resemble small suns. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a long-lasting appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum leucophyllum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
