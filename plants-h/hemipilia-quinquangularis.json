    "intro": "Hemipilia quinquangularis, commonly known as the five-angled hemipilia, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a unique floral structure with five distinct sepals and petals, giving it its common name. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia quinquangularis is considered a critically endangered species."
