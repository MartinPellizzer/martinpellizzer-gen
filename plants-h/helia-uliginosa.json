    "intro": "Helia uliginosa, commonly known as the bog rosemary, is a flowering plant native to wetland and bog environments in North America. It is a low-growing shrub with narrow, needle-like leaves that help it conserve moisture in its moist, acidic habitat. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and it plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Helia uliginosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
