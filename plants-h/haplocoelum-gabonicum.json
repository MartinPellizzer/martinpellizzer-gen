    "intro": "Haplocoelum gabonicum, commonly known as the Gabon starwood, is a rare and unique plant native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It belongs to the family Meliaceae, which includes mahogany and related trees. The plant is characterized by its distinctive star-shaped leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for undisturbed tropical ecosystems. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
