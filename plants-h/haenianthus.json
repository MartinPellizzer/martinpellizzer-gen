    "intro": "Haenianthus, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Asteraceae family. These plants are typically found in coastal regions and are adapted to saline and sandy soils. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple ray florets and spiny, lobed leaves. Haenianthus species are often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes due to their hardiness and ornamental value. The genus includes several species, such as Haenianthus leucotrichus, which is native to the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts."
