    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 bifurcum subsp. mesoschistum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves, which are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges, and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. Due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil types, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
