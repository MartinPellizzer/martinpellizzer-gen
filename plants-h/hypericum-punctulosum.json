    "intro": "Hypericum punctulosum, commonly known as the prickly St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub that typically reaches heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are covered in tiny, glandular dots that give it a slightly sticky texture. Hypericum punctulosum thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or dry habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
