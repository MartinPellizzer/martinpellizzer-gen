    "intro": "Hieracium besnellum, commonly known as the Besnells' hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium besnellum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
