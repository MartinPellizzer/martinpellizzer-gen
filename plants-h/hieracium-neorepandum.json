    "intro": "Hieracium neorepandum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and is often found in moist environments. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively, making it an aggressive colonizer. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a potential invasive species in certain regions."
