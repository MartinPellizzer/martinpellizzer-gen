    "intro": "Homalobus stipitatus, commonly known as the red-stemmed orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and private collections."
