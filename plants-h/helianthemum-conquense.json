It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain water in its arid native habitat. It is well adapted to rocky and coastal environments, often found on sunny slopes. Its compact growth habit and vibrant flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
