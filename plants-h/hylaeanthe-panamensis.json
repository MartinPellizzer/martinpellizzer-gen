    "intro": "Hylaeanthe panamensis, commonly known as the Panama hylaeanthe, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central America, particularly Panama. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences that consist of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories, where it thrives in the humid and warm climate. Its foliage consists of lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a distinctive, elongated fruit that contains multiple seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hylaeanthe panamensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
