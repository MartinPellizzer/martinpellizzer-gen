    "intro": "Hieracium polypodum, commonly known as the lesser hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters, with upright, hairy stems and basal leaves that are broadly lance-shaped. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium polypodum is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
