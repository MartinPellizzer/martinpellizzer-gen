    "intro": "Hymenolepis vaupelii, commonly known as the Vaupel's tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It primarily infects rodents, such as rats, and is characterized by its complex life cycle involving both definitive and intermediate hosts. The adult worm resides in the small intestine of the definitive host, where it attaches using its suckers and absorbs nutrients from the host's digested food. The plant aspect is not applicable, as Hymenolepis vaupelii is an animal parasite, not a botanical species. Therefore, this query contains an error in classification."
