    "intro": "Halodule ciliata, commonly known as the ciliated shoalgrass, is a seagrass species native to tropical and subtropical coastal regions. It thrives in shallow, brackish waters and is often found in estuaries and mangrove swamps. The plant has long, narrow leaves with fine cilia along the edges, which aid in water movement and gas exchange. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various marine organisms. Halodule ciliata is also important for carbon sequestration and nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems."
