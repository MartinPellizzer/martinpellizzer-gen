    "intro": "Hepatica nobilis var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy liverleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive trifoliate leaves that are often hairy, especially along the veins, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy blue or white flowers in early spring, typically before the leaves fully expand. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas with rich, well-drained soil. The hairy liverleaf is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its early blooming habit."
