    "intro": "Herminium cordatum, commonly known as the heart-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a rosette. The plant produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded woodlands and is often found in rich, organic soils. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
