    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. amphiastum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has rough, hairy leaves that are usually lance-shaped and often have a reddish or purplish tinge. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
