    "intro": "Hedyosmos incisus, commonly known as the African velvetleaf, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by distinctive, three-lobed seed pods. Hedyosmos incisus is typically found in moist, shady habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks. It is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage."
