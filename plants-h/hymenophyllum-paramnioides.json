    "intro": "Hymenophyllum paramnioides, commonly known as the silver moss, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, glabrous leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a layer of fine, silvery hairs. This plant thrives in cool, moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorocarps, are clustered in small, cup-like formations on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum paramnioides is well adapted to high humidity and is often found in areas with consistent moisture, such as rainforests or shaded gardens."
