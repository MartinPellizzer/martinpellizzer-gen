    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. deductum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has small, linear leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
