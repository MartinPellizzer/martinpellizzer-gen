    "intro": "Heliocarpus appendiculatus, commonly known as the yellow soursop or yellow mangosteen, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its distinctive yellow, fleshy fruits that contain multiple seeds. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is edible, though the taste can vary, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological importance in its native habitats."
