    "intro": "Heteropterys admirabilis, commonly known as the silverleaf huito, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hair. The plant produces showy, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by distinctive, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
