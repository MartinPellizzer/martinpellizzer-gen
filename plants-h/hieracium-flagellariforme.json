    "intro": "Hieracium flagellariforme, commonly known as the flagellate hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering heads are composed of numerous yellow disk flowers. It produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse via wind, aiding in its spread. The species is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive growth habit."
