    "intro": "Hieracium maranzae subsp. maranzae, commonly known as the Maranza's hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 1,500 meters. It produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers bloom from June to August. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
