    "intro": "Hieracium scutatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and clusters of yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Hieracium scutatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
