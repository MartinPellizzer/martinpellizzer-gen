    "intro": "Hakea kennedyana, commonly known as the Kennedy's hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. Hakea kennedyana is adapted to survive in dry conditions and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
