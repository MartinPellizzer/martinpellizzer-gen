    "intro": "Helianthemon, commonly known as the sunflower, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to North America. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower heads that follow the sun's movement throughout the day, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. The plant has a robust stem with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers consist of a central disc surrounded by ray florets, which are typically yellow. Helianthemon is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine."
