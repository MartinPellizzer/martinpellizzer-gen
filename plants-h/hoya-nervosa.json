    "intro": "Hoya nervosa, commonly known as the nerve-veined wax plant, is a tropical evergreen vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, oval-shaped leaves with prominent vein patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya nervosa thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
