    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. forcipula, commonly known as the forcipulate hare\u2019s foot, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the orchid family. It is characterized by its unique, hare\u2019s foot-like inflorescence, which consists of a dense cluster of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant is typically found in moist, calcareous grasslands and is often associated with specific microhabitats. Its leaves are lanceolate and arranged in a rosette, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
