    "intro": "Hevea viridis, commonly known as the green rubber tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, dark green bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and pointed. The plant is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its latex-producing properties, though it is less commercially significant than Hevea brasiliensis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. The leaves are typically arranged alternately along the stems, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
