    "intro": "Hemimeris pachyceras, commonly known as the thick-shelled bean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, thickened pods that encase its seeds. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to several meters. Its leaves are compound, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters. The thick, leathery pods are often used in traditional medicine and are an important part of the plant's ecological role in its native habitat."
