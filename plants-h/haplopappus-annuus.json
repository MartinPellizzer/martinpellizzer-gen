    "intro": "Haplopappus annuus, commonly known as the annual hawksbeard, is an annual flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers appear in late summer, and the plant produces small, dry fruits called achene, which are surrounded by bracts. Haplopappus annuus is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
