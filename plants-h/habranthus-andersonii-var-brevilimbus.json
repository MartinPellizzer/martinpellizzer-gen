    "intro": "Habranthus andersonii var. brevilimbus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf habranthus, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and swampy areas. It has a short rhizomatous stem and produces berries that are dispersed by birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
