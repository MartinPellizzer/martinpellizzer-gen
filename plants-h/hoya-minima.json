    "intro": "Hoya minima, commonly known as the baby hoya, is a compact, trailing plant native to Southeast Asia. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, or red, often blooming during the summer months. Hoya minima is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is valued for its ease of care and aesthetic appeal. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
