    "intro": "Henriettella membranifolia, commonly known as the paperleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, thin, and often translucent leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. Henriettella membranifolia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal and unique foliage."
