    "intro": "Heteronoma diversifolium, commonly known as the diverse-leaf heteronoma, is a rare and specialized plant species found in specific alpine environments. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which varies in shape and size across different parts of the plant, giving it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high elevations, where it faces harsh climatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors that aid in pollination by insects. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heteronoma diversifolium is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
