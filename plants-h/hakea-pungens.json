    "intro": "Hakea pungens, commonly known as the stinging hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and striking red or orange flowers that appear in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are covered in fine, stinging hairs, which can cause irritation upon contact. Its flowers are typically arranged in cylindrical spikes and are pollinated by birds and insects. Hakea pungens is well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance."
