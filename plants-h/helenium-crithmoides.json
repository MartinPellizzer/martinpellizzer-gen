    "intro": "Helenium crithmoides, commonly known as the swamp helenium, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, orange to yellow ray flowers. The plant typically grows in marshy areas and has slender, grass-like leaves that help it thrive in moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late summer to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Helenium crithmoides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
