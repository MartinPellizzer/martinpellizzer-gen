    "intro": "Hoya obscura subsp. lagunaensis, commonly known as the Lagunaensis Wandering Jade, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a climbing epiphytic plant characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
