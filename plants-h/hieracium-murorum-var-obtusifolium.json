    "intro": "Hieracium murorum var. obtusifolium, commonly known as the blunt-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of dark green, broadly ovate leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
