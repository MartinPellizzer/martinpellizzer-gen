It belongs to the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically purple or white. The plant produces berries that contain toxic alkaloids, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it is not commonly cultivated but is of interest in botanical and pharmacological studies."
