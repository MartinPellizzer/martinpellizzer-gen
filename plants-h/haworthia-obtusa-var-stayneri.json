    "intro": "Haworthia obtusa var. stayneri, commonly known as the Stayner's Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, pale green to bluish-gray leaves with white tubercles and prominent central spines. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
