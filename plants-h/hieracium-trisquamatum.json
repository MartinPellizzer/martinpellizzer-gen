    "intro": "Hieracium trisquamatum, commonly known as the three-scale hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped. Hieracium trisquamatum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense mats, making it a common weed in some regions."
