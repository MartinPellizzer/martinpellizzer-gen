    "intro": "Hieracium microtum subsp. chlorochroma, commonly known as the green-centred hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and herbaceous growth habit. The subspecies is distinguished by its bright green central disc and yellow marginal florets, which contrast with the typical yellow of other hawkweed species. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is perennial and can reach heights of up to 30 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves."
