    "intro": "Herpestis cowellii, commonly known as the desert parsley, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and small, yellowish flowers. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and desert scrub habitats. It produces small, dry fruits that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
