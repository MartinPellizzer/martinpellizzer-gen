It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is noted for its medicinal properties, particularly in treating dysentery due to the presence of alkaloids like strychnine and brucine. Its bark and roots are traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine for their anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic effects. The plant thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, often found in dry forests and scrublands."
