    "intro": "Hemisorghum, commonly known as dwarf millet, is a small annual grass native to the arid regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny grains, which are typically harvested for their nutritional value. Hemisorghum is drought-tolerant and thrives in poor soil conditions, making it a hardy crop for marginal agricultural areas. Its botanical features make it an important species in both traditional and modern agricultural systems."
