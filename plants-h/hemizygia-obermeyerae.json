    "intro": "Hemizygia obermeyerae, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming during the summer months. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and the plant is well adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with minimal water availability."
