    "intro": "Hyparrhenia niariensis, commonly known as the African grass or niari grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as savannas and grasslands, often forming dense clumps. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers. It is adapted to dry conditions and can tolerate poor soil, making it a hardy species. Hyparrhenia niariensis is sometimes used in traditional practices and has potential for erosion control due to its extensive root system."
