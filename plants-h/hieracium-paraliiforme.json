It is a perennial herb that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds typical of coastal environments. Its botanical features make it an important species in coastal ecology and a subject of study in plant adaptation."
