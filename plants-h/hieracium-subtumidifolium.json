    "intro": "Hieracium subtumidifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, typically from July to September, and are arranged in a cluster at the top of the stem. Hieracium subtumidifolium is often found in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
