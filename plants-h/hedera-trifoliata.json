    "intro": "Hedera trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, trifoliate leaves, each consisting of three ovate to elliptical lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Hedera trifoliata is also valued for its ability to climb and cover walls or trellises effectively."
