It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. It features basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a single head. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
