    "intro": "Hieracium pedunculigerum f. spathulifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to spatulate leaves, which are typically hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ease of cultivation, it is sometimes grown in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
