    "intro": "Hypolepis trichodes, commonly known as the hairy shield fern, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit and produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves. Its leaves are typically bipinnate, with a dense covering of fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Hypolepis trichodes is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides."
