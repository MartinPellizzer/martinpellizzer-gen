    "intro": "Hypericum scabrum var. laeve, commonly known as rough St. John's wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its rough, hairy stems and leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open woodlands. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is known for its medicinal properties, though it contains phototoxic compounds. Its common name reflects the rough texture of its foliage, which is a distinguishing feature of the species."
