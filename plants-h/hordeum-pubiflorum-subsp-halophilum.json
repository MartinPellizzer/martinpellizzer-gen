It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet inflorescences. The plant thrives in coastal and inland saline soils, often found in wetlands and salt marshes. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of salt-tolerant vegetation. Botanically, it belongs to the Poaceae family and is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in salty habitats."
