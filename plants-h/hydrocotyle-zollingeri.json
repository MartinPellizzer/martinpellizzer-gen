    "intro": "Hydrocotyle zollingeri, commonly known as the Zollinger's marsh penny, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in South America. It features small, rounded leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes make it an effective colonizer of disturbed wetland habitats."
