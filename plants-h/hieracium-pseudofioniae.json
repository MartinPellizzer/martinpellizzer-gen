    "intro": "Hieracium pseudofioniae, commonly known as the Fionian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it tolerates harsh environmental conditions. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
