    "intro": "Hotnima teissonnieri, commonly known as the Madagascar star vine, is a climbing plant native to the tropical rainforests of Madagascar. It features slender, woody stems that twine around supporting structures, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the wet season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its unique morphology and restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
