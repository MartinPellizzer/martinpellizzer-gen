    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. lanosiceps, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, often with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. This subspecies is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
