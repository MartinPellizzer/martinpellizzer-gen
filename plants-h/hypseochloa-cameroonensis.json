    "intro": "Hypseochloa cameroonensis, commonly known as the Cameroon needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
