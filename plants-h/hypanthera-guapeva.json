    "intro": "Hypanthera guapeva, commonly known as the Guapeva orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking array of colors. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its leaves are elongated and glossy, adapted to capture moisture from the humid environment. Due to habitat loss, Hypanthera guapeva is considered endangered, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
