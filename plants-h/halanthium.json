These plants are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Halanthium species are characterized by their small, delicate leaves that often form a rosette-like structure on the water's surface. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life. The genus is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often used in water garden settings."
