    "intro": "Hosta, commonly known as the plantain lily, is a genus of about 70 species of rhizomatous, herbaceous, perennials. These plants are native to eastern Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea, and are widely cultivated for their attractive, often variegated foliage. Hosta leaves are typically broad, heart-shaped, and can range in color from deep green to blue-green, with some varieties displaying white or yellow variegation. They produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually white or green, appearing on tall, slender stalks. Hostas thrive in shady, moist environments and are popular in garden landscapes for their ornamental value."
