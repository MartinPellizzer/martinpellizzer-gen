    "intro": "Hedysarum petraeum, commonly known as the rock hedysarum, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to thrive in rocky and well-drained soils. Hedysarum petraeum is often found in alpine and steppe environments, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
