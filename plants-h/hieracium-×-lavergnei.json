    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 lavergnei, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. It is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
