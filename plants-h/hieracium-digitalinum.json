    "intro": "Hieracium digitalinum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers are borne on slender stems and are followed by oval, hairy seed heads. Hieracium digitalinum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed sites."
