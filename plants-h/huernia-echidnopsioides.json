    "intro": "Huernia echidnopsioides, commonly known as the elephant's foot cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a distinctive, swollen, branching stem that resembles an elephant's foot, which stores water for drought periods. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces yellow to orange flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
