    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. asterocymum, commonly known as the red-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its subspecies status is due to subtle differences in morphology, particularly in flower color and fruit structure. It is a low-growing plant with a rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear clusters of small, composite flowers."
