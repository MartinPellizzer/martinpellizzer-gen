    "intro": "Hybanthus chiapensis, commonly known as the Chiapas hybanthus, is a flowering plant native to Central America, particularly found in the rainforests of Chiapas, Mexico. It belongs to the family Violaceae, which includes many flowering plants with showy blooms. The plant is characterized by its small, tubular flowers that are typically pale blue or violet in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or in dense undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
