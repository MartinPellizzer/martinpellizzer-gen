    "intro": "Helianthemum erectum, commonly known as the upright rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
