    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolatypeum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single, terminal capitulum. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has a fibrous root system and can form dense colonies, making it an invasive species in some regions. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other hawkweeds, particularly through its leaf morphology and flower structure."
