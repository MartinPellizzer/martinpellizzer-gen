    "intro": "Hylotelephium paradoxum, commonly known as the Armenian carpet or autumn sedum, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange, typically in late summer to early autumn. It forms dense mats or cushions, often carpeting rocky slopes and dry meadows. Hylotelelephium paradoxum is popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low maintenance and ornamental value."
