It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often glabrous and have a glossy surface. It produces small, clustered white to pale pink flowers, followed by bright blue, fleshy berries that are edible. The berries are highly attractive to birds, which aid in seed dispersal."
