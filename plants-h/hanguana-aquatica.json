    "intro": "Hanguana aquatica, commonly known as the water hanguana, is a rare aquatic plant found in specific wetland environments. It has long, thin leaves that are adapted for underwater growth, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the surrounding water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface, aiding in pollination by insects. Its roots help stabilize the sediment in shallow water bodies, contributing to the ecosystem's health. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hanguana aquatica is considered a vulnerable species."
