    "intro": "Haemocharis buxifolia, commonly known as the wax plant or waxleaf hibiscus, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It features striking, waxy, dark green leaves with a velvety texture, and its flowers are typically bright yellow with a red center. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in clusters, often in shades of yellow and red. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Haemocharis buxifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its attractive foliage and vibrant blooms."
