    "intro": "Hypecoum millefolium, commonly known as the common hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dark green, broadly ovate leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a spiky structure, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. However, it is toxic and should be handled with care."
