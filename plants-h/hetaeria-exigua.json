    "intro": "Hetaeria exigua, commonly known as the small hetaeria, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apiaceae. It is a small annual herb that typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that appear in umbels. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, and it is often found in sandy or gravelly areas. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
