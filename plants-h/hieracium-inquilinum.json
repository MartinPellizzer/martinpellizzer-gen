    "intro": "Hieracium inquilinum, commonly known as the mossy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that often form a rosette. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Hieracium inquilinum is often found growing in association with mosses, which is reflected in its common name."
