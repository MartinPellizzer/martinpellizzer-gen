    "intro": "Hakea annulifera, commonly known as the ringed hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, cylindrical, woody stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that appear in dense clusters during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green color. Hakea annulifera is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species."
