    "intro": "Hebe ciliata, commonly known as the silver fringed hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically in spring or early summer. Hebe ciliata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
