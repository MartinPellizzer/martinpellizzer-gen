    "intro": "Hieracium mollipes, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in various soil conditions. Hieracium mollipes is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
