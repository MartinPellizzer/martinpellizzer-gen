    "intro": "Hieracium pholidotum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of stiff, hairy leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with a central disk. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
