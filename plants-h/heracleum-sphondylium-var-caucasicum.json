    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. caucasicum, commonly known as Caucasian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is native to the Caucasus region. The plant produces greenish-yellow flowers in umbrella-shaped clusters, which attract various pollinators. It is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and forest edges across its native range. Due to its toxic sap, it requires caution when handling."
