    "intro": "Heteropterys procoriacea f. hispida, commonly known as the hairy heteropterys, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a rough texture due to the presence of fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or white, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in well-drained, sunny conditions."
