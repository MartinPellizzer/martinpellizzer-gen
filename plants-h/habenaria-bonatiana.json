    "intro": "Habenaria bonatiana, commonly known as the Bonati's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces inflorescences bearing small, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
