    "intro": "Holcus mollis subsp. triflorus, commonly known as the three-flowered meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces three to five spikelets per node along its flowering stems. The leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and the plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect populations."
