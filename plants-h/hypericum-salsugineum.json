    "intro": "Hypericum salsugineum, commonly known as sea buckthorn, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing shrub that thrives in sandy or saline soils, often found in coastal dunes and rocky shores. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh coastal environments. Hypericum salsugineum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems and supporting local wildlife."
