    "intro": "Hura polyandra, commonly known as the flame tree, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters, creating a dramatic visual display. The tree has a sturdy, often spiny trunk and large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 30 centimeters in diameter. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Hura polyandra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
