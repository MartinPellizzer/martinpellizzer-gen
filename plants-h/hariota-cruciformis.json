    "intro": "Hariota cruciformis, commonly known as the crossleaf plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its distinctive cruciform (cross-shaped) leaves, which are divided into four lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Due to its unique morphology, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
