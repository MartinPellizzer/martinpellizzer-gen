    "intro": "Habenaria pseudodenticulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soil. The plant features slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its specialized root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the waterlogged environment. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable in some regions, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
