    "intro": "Hyline nocturna, commonly known as the nightshade vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a velvety texture and produces striking purple flowers at night. The plant is known for its bioluminescent properties, which enhance its visibility in low-light conditions. Its fruits are toxic and contain alkaloids, making it a plant of both botanical interest and caution. Hyline nocturna thrives in humid environments and is often found in dense undergrowth."
