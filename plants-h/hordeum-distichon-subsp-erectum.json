    "intro": "Hordeum distichon subsp. erectum, commonly known as the upright two-row barley, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and two-row arrangement of spikelets along the stem. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into three-angled, glabrous grains. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and is valued for its hardiness and potential in forage and grain production."
