    "intro": "Hippocratea urceolus f. rotundifolia, commonly known as the rounded-leaf hooded orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique, hood-like flower structure and its distinctive, rounded leaves that set it apart from other members of the species. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually a vibrant yellow or orange, with intricate patterns that attract specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
