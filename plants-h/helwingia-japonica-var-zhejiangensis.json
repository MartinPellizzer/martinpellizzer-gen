    "intro": "Helwingia japonica var. zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang helwingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Zhejiang Province in eastern China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its dense clusters of small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces delicate, pendulous inflorescences bearing white or pale yellow flowers in early spring. Its ornamental value lies in its compact growth habit and seasonal foliage, making it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
