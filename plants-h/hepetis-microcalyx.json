    "intro": "Hepetis microcalyx, commonly known as the small-flowered hepatica, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often adorned with white or pale green markings. The plant produces clusters of small, showy blue to violet flowers in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, shaded woodland environments and is often found in rich, loamy soils. Hepetis microcalyx is valued for its early bloom and its role in supporting pollinators in forest ecosystems."
