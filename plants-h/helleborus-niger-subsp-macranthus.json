    "intro": "Helleborus niger subsp. macranthus, commonly known as the Christmas rose, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves and clusters of ivory-white, waxy flowers that bloom in winter. The plant prefers cool, moist, and shady environments, often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Its flowers are typically borne on short, sturdy stems and are notable for their early blooming period. The subspecies macranthus is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to the typical H. niger."
