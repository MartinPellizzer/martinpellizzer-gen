    "intro": "Heracleum bivittatum, commonly known as the two-striped cow parsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. It is a biennial plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant features large, heart-shaped basal leaves with a distinctive white vein pattern, and its stems are hollow and often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in compound umbels, and the plant produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. It is often mistaken for other members of the carrot family due to its similar appearance and fragrance."
