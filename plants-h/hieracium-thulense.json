It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
