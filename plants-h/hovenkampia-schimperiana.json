    "intro": "Hovenkampia schimperiana, commonly known as the Schimper's hovenkampia, is a rare and specialized epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding tank. The plant's leaves are typically broad and fleshy, adapted to capture and retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces striking inflorescences with brightly colored flowers, often in shades of red or orange, which attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
