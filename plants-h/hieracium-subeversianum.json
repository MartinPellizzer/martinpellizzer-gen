    "intro": "Hieracium subeversianum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its creeping growth habit. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
