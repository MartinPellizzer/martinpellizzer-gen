    "intro": "Hosta latifolia var. aureomaculata, commonly known as the golden spotted plantain, is a shade-tolerant perennial with broad, waxy leaves that display a striking combination of chartreuse and green. Its foliage features distinctive yellow spots and margins, which become more pronounced in sunlight. The plant produces upright, spike-like flower clusters that bear white to pale blue flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is prized for its ornamental value in shaded garden settings. This cultivar is relatively low maintenance and suitable for both container gardening and in-ground planting."
