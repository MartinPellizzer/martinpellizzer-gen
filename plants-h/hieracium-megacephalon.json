    "intro": "Hieracium megacephalon, commonly known as the giant ragwort, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has deeply lobed leaves and produces a milky sap that can be toxic to livestock. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
