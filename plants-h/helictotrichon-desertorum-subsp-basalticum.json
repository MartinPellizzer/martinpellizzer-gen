It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple florets, which are typical of the Poaceae family. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soils and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
