    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. membranulatum, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, with a distinctive basal rosette structure, and it produces yellow flowers from late spring to early summer. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native flora."
