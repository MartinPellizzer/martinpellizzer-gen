    "intro": "Hieracium glaciellum subsp. stenops, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats with narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is adapted to cold, rocky environments and thrives in high-altitude conditions. Its subspecies name, *stenops*, refers to its narrow flower heads. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountainous habitats."
