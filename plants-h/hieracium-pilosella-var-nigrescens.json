    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella var. nigrescens, commonly known as the black-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves that are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with tubular florets surrounding ray florets. Its leaves and stems are covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, and is often found in disturbed soils."
