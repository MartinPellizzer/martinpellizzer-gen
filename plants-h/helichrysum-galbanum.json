The plant produces a distinctive, aromatic resin that has been used in traditional medicine and perfumery. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Helichrysum galbanum is also known for its hardy nature and ability to survive in arid conditions."
