It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium parcifloccum is often found in open habitats and is relatively easy to cultivate in gardens with well-drained soil."
