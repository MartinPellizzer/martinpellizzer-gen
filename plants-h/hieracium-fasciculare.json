    "intro": "Hieracium fasciculare, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, loamy conditions. Its basal leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are upright and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. The flowers are yellow, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and bloom from late spring to early autumn."
