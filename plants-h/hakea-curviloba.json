    "intro": "Hakea curviloba, commonly known as the spiral hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its unique, spirally arranged leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces cylindrical, red or orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody structure and dense foliage make it well adapted to the dry, sandy soils of its native habitat. Hakea curviloba is often cultivated for its ornamental value and resilience in arid conditions."
