    "intro": "Haworthiopsis viscosa, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinct white or yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on short, leafless stems during the summer months. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in bright, indirect light with minimal water. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
