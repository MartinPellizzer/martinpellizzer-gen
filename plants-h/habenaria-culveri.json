    "intro": "Habenaria culveri, commonly known as Culver's hooded orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive hood-shaped labellum and showy, violet to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as pine forests and swampy areas. It has linear to strap-shaped leaves and produces a single, erect stem bearing several flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered threatened and is protected in many states."
