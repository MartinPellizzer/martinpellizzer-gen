It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish-orange flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions of Europe. It is a perennial species that can form dense colonies, often in meadows and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits genetic variability and can be challenging to distinguish from its parent species."
