    "intro": "Habenaria dentata var. ecalcarata, commonly known as the toothed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with distinctive tooth-like projections on the petals and sepals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
