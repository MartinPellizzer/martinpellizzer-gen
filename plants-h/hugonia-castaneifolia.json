    "intro": "Hugonia castaneifolia, commonly known as the horse chestnut tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble those of the horse chestnut, giving it its common name. The tree produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers in the spring, followed by spiny, orange-brown fruits that contain bright red seeds. Its botanical features include a smooth, gray bark and a broad, rounded canopy. Hugonia castaneifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and shade-providing capabilities in landscapes."
