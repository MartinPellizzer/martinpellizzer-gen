    "intro": "Hymenasplenium tholiforme, commonly known as the rock spleenwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant characterized by its non-vascular structure and lack of true roots, stems, and leaves. This plant typically grows on rock surfaces in moist, shaded environments, often in mountainous regions. Its fronds are closely appressed to the substrate, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Hymenasplenium tholiforme plays a role in stabilizing rocky habitats and contributes to the ecological diversity of its environment."
