    "intro": "Heracleum paphlagonicum, commonly known as the Paphlagonian hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like compound leaves. It is native to regions of southern Europe and western Asia, including parts of Turkey and the Balkans. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spherical umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs and can grow up to 1 meter in length. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially dangerous plant that should be handled with care."
