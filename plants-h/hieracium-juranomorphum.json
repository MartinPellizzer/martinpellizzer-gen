    "intro": "Hieracium juranomorphum, commonly known as the Juran Mountains hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
