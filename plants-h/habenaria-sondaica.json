    "intro": "Habenaria sondaica, commonly known as the Sunda orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia, including parts of Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth, where it thrives in well-drained, humus-rich soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
