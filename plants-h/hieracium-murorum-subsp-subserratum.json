    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subserratum, commonly known as the serrated mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often toothed or serrated, giving it its subspecific name. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe. Due to its ornamental appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
