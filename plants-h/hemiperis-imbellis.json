    "intro": "Hemiperis imbellis, commonly known as the lesser bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its tiny, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, still freshwater environments such as ponds and ditches. It has small, green leaves that are often submerged, with the bladders attached to the stems. Hemiperis imbellis is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
