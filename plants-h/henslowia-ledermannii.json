    "intro": "Henslowia ledermannii, commonly known as the Ledermann's henslowia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Henslowia ledermannii thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded, woodland environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
