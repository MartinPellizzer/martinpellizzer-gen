    "intro": "Hakea patentiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or conical flower spikes, typically in shades of yellow or orange, which bloom in spring. Hakea patentiloba is adapted to sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to arid and semi-arid environments. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing habitat for native wildlife."
