    "intro": "Hechtia roseana, commonly known as the pink hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant pink or red flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically blue-green in color with a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Hechtia roseana is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
