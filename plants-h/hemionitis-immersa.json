    "intro": "Hemionitis immersa, commonly known as the water hemlock, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Hemionitis immersa thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its toxic properties, it is important to avoid ingestion or contact with the plant."
