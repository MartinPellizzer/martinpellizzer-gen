    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudoversicolor, commonly known as the ghost cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, columnar stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid environments. This species is often cultivated for its striking appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
