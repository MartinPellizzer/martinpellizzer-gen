    "intro": "Hieracium delicatulum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and features basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy. Its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and the plant often thrives in meadows and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
