    "intro": "Huperzia lucidula var. asiatica, commonly known as the Asian shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern genus Huperzia. It is a terrestrial fern characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, leathery fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
