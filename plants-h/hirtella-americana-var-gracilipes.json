    "intro": "Hirtella americana var. gracilipes, commonly known as the slender hirtella, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical forests. The fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that contains several seeds, contributing to its propagation in the wild."
