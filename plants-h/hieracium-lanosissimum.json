    "intro": "Hieracium lanosissimum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family. It is characterized by its hairy, often reddish stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the genus Hieracium. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
