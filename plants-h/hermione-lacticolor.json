    "intro": "Hermione lacticolor, commonly known as the Milky Hermione, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its striking white petals that emit a faint luminescent glow at night, a unique trait attributed to its specialized bioluminescent pigments. The plant's leaves are broad and waxy, adapted to conserve moisture in its arid environment. It blooms once a year during the summer solstice, attracting specific pollinators that have evolved to navigate its glowing flowers. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is classified as an endangered species."
