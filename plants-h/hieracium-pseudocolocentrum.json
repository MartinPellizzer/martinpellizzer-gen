    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocolocentrum, commonly known as the false colicentrum hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a rosette of basal leaves with a hairy texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, elongated achenes as its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
