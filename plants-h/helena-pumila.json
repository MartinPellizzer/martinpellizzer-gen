    "intro": "Helena pumila, commonly known as the dwarf helena, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pale pink to white in color. Helena pumila thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers a sunny to partially shaded environment. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, compact mats."
