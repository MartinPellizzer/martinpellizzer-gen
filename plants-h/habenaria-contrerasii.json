    "intro": "Habenaria contrerasii, commonly known as the Contreras' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests. Its roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the forest floor, and it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The species is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological adaptations."
