    "intro": "Hieracium laevifolium, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a smooth, waxy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
