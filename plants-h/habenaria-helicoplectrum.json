It is characterized by its unique spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in the understory of tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and greenish-yellow, with a distinct lip that is often marked with purple or brown streaks. Habenaria helicoplectrum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
