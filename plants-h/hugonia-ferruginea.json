    "intro": "Hugonia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty hugonia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hugonia ferruginea is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
