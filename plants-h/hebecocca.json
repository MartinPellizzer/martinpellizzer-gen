    "intro": "Hebecocca, commonly known as the common hebecocca, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or subshrubs native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have simple, alternate leaves with a distinctive veining pattern, and they produce small, clustered flowers with five petals. Hebecocca species are often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or scrub habitats. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
