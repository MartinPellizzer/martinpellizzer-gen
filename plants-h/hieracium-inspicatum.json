It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium inspicatum is known for its ornamental value but can also be invasive in certain regions."
