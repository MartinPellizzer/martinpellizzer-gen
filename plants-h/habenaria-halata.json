    "intro": "Habenaria halata, commonly known as the fairy wreath orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped flowers that resemble a wreath, typically in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with rhizomes that allow it to spread slowly over time. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern around the stem. Habenaria halata thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
