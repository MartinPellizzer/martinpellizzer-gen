    "intro": "Hypericum subliberum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in herbal medicine, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
