    "intro": "Haplopappus integerrimus, commonly known as the rough pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is distinguished by its rough, bristly pappus, which aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its foliage is generally gray-green, with narrow, linear leaves that reduce water loss."
