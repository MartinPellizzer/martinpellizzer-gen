    "intro": "Holcus lanatus var. albovirens, commonly known as the white-veined meadow grass, is a variant of the common bentgrass. It is characterized by its finely textured, silver-green foliage with prominent white veins, giving it a distinctive appearance. This grass thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Its growth habit is prostrate to upright, depending on environmental conditions, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant is valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in wetland areas."
