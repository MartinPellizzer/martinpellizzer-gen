    "intro": "Helicteres integrifolia subsp. dentata, commonly known as the broadleaf candlewood, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly toothed margin. The plant produces clusters of yellow, candle-like flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The subspecies dentata differs from the typical form by its more pronounced leaf teeth and slightly different growth habits."
