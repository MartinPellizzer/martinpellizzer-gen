    "intro": "Helichrysum panormitanum, commonly known as the Sicilian immortelle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Sicily. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain vibrant even when dried. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas and scrublands. Its small, narrow leaves are arranged in a compact, bushy form, and it produces numerous tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal and resilience."
