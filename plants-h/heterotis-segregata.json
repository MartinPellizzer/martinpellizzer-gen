    "intro": "Heterotis segregata, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a herbaceous perennial native to tropical Africa. It features distinctive whorled leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are sometimes harvested for their medicinal properties, particularly for their anti-inflammatory effects. Heterotis segregata thrives in wetland environments and is often found near water bodies."
