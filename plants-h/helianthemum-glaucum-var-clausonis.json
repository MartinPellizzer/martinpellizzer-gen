    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. clausonis, commonly known as the cliff helianthemum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Europe. It features dense, compact growth with silver-gray foliage that provides a striking visual contrast against rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in early summer, adding a cheerful touch to its natural habitat. It is well adapted to harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. This variety is often used in rock gardens or as a hardy ground cover due to its resilience and ornamental value."
