    "intro": "Haplopappus ilicifolius, commonly known as the creeping eupatorium, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with woody stems and small, opposite leaves that resemble those of holly, hence its common name. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by small, papery bracts. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert and semi-arid environments. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, arid conditions."
