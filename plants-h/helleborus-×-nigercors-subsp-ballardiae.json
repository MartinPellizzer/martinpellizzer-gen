    "intro": "Helleborus \u00d7 nigercors subsp. ballardiae, commonly known as the Ballard's black hellebore, is a hybrid evergreen perennial native to the Appalachian Mountains of eastern North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, glossy foliage and produces clusters of dark purple to black, bell-shaped flowers in late winter to early spring. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. It is noted for its ornamental value and is often cultivated for its striking foliage and unique floral display. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
