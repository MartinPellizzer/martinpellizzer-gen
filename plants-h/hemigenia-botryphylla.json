    "intro": "Hemigenia botryphylla, commonly known as the woolly hemigenia, is a small shrub native to the southeastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and dry forests. Hemigenia botryphylla is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional Aboriginal medicine."
