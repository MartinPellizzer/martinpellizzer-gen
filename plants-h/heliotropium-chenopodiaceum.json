    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodiaceum, commonly known as the sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Americas. It is a low-growing shrub with slender, branched stems that often appear prostrate or ascending. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, which bloom in response to sunlight, a trait known as heliotropism. Its leaves are typically narrow and succulent, adapted to conserve water in dry environments. The plant is often found in sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
