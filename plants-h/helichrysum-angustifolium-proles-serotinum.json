    "intro": "Helichrysum angustifolium proles serotinum, commonly known as the late-flowering narrow-leaved everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its small, golden-yellow flower heads that resemble daisies, and its narrow, linear leaves. The plant is native to southern Africa and thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. It is often found growing on rocky soils and in open grasslands. Its resilience to drought and ability to retain its color after drying make it a popular choice for ornamental use."
