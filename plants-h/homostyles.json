    "intro": "Homostyles, commonly known as the genus *Homostylus*, are a group of flowering plants belonging to the family Apocynaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often brightly colored flowers that are typically bilateral in symmetry. The flowers usually have five petals, with two upper petals that are larger and more prominent than the three lower ones. Homostyles are native to tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value due to their striking floral displays."
