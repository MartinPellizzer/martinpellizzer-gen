    "intro": "Hemipappus isabellinus, commonly known as the yellow pappus plant, is a flowering plant species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Hemipappus isabellinus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in dry, sunny conditions."
