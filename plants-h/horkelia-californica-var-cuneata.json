    "intro": "Horkelia californica var. cuneata, commonly known as the Sierra Valley horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, rocky habitats and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is considered a rare and endemic species, found primarily in the Sierra Nevada foothills."
