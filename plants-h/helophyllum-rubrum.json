    "intro": "Helophyllum rubrum, commonly known as the red stemmed sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, exhibiting a clump-forming growth habit with triangular stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, which are often clustered at the ends of the stems. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a reddish hue that becomes more pronounced in the fall. Helophyllum rubrum plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
