    "intro": "Henckelia filicalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false dandelion, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming during the warmer months. Henckelia filicalyx is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystems, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
