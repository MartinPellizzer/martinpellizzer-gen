    "intro": "Hemsleya mitrata, commonly known as the helmet orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique helmet-shaped flower, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows on trees or rocky surfaces, relying on its roots to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air. Its flowers are usually bright yellow or orange, with a prominent, hood-like structure that protects the reproductive organs. Hemsleya mitrata is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
