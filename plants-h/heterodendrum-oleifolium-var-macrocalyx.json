    "intro": "Heterodendrum oleifolium var. macrocalyx, commonly known as the large-flowered heterodendrum, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that are typically borne in clusters at the ends of its branches. The leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
