    "intro": "Hesperis imbricatifolia, commonly known as the rock scabious, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped, gray-green leaves and its clusters of small, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other flowering plants such as cabbages and mustards. Hesperis imbricatifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators in its native environment."
