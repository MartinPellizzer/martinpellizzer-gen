    "intro": "Hydrangea scandens var. grosseserrata, commonly known as the serrated climbing hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub or vine native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy bract-like flowers that are typically white or pink, which appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, serrated leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail. The flowers are followed by persistent, cone-like fruits that contain small, hard seeds."
