    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba f. yanghuangensis, commonly known as the Yanghuangensis arrowleaf, is a rare variant of the arrowleaf water plantain. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with five lobes, which are typically broad and slightly notched. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its flowering stems produce small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, adding to its ornamental value. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological features."
