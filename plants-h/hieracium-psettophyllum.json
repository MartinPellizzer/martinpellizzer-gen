    "intro": "Hieracium psettophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its bright yellow flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium psettophyllum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
