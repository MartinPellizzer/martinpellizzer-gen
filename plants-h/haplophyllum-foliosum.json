    "intro": "Haplophyllum foliosum, commonly known as the leafy holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in countries like Thailand and Vietnam. The plant is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which consists of small, leathery leaves arranged in a compact, shrub-like form. It produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Haplophyllum foliosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
