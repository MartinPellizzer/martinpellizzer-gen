    "intro": "Hieracium apicum, commonly known as the tall hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its flowers are arranged in a composite head. Hieracium apicum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
