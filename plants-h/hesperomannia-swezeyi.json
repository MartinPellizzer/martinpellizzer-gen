    "intro": "Hesperomannia swezeyi, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that was historically prized for its use in traditional Hawaiian culture. The plant has simple, elliptical leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered endangered and is protected under conservation efforts. Its botanical significance lies in its unique adaptations to the island's ecosystem and its cultural and ecological importance."
