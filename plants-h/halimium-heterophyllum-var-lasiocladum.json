    "intro": "Halimium heterophyllum var. lasiocladum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, glandular, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has hairy, grayish-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rocky or sandy soils. The varietal name *lasiocladum* refers to its dense, woolly covering of hairs on the stems and leaves."
