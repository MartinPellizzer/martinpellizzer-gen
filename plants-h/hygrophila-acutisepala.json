It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically blue or purple and bloom in clusters. Hygrophila acutisepala is known for its ability to absorb nutrients from water, making it useful in water purification."
