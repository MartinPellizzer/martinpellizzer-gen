It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by small, capsule-like fruits. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in disturbed soils."
