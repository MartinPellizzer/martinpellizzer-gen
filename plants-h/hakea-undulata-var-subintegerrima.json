    "intro": "Hakea undulata var. subintegerrima, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
