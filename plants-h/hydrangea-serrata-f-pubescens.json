    "intro": "Hydrangea serrata f. pubescens, commonly known as the Japanese hydrangea or mountain hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its serrated leaves and showy, cone-shaped flower clusters that range in color from white to pink depending on soil pH. The plant thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to produce large, fluffy blooms in late summer. The pubescens form refers to the hairy texture of its leaves, which distinguishes it from other hydrangea varieties."
