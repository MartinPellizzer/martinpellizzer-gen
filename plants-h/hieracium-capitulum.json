    "intro": "Hieracium capitulum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy flower head composed of ray florets. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse easily by wind. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Hieracium capitulum is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
