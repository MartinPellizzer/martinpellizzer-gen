    "intro": "Hieracium mallocephaliforme, commonly known as the Mallocephalous Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow flowers in the summer months. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and is often considered a weed."
