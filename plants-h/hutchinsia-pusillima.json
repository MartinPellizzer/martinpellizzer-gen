    "intro": "Hutchinsia pusillima, commonly known as the small-flowered hutchinsia, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its delicate, daisy-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and small landscapes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
