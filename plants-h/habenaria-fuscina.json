    "intro": "Habenaria fuscina, commonly known as the brown lady's-tresses, is a species of orchid native to various regions in Asia, including India, China, and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark brown to reddish-brown stems and its dense, spiraled arrangement of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and mountainous areas. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other small insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native ecosystems."
