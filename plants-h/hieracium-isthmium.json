    "intro": "Hieracium isthmium, commonly known as the Isthmus hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this species thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, hairy leaves and produces seeds in small, fluffy structures called pappi. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
