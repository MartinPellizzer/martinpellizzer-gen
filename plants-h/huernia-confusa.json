    "intro": "Huernia confusa, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a succulent belonging to the Asclepiadaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and spiky, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats, often resembling a ghostly appearance due to its pale coloration. Huernia confusa is well adapted to drought conditions, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
