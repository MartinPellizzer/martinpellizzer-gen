    "intro": "Hoya cutis-porcelana, commonly known as the porcelain hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often porcelain-like leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, typically blooming during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage. Hoya cutis-porcelana prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation."
