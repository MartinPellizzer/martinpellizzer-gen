    "intro": "Hemipilia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine hemipilia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring cool, moist environments. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense clumps over time. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hemipilia alpestris is often found in high-altitude meadows and is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
