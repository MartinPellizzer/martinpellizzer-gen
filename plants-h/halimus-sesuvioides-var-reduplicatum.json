    "intro": "Halimus sesuvioides var. reduplicatum, commonly known as the reduplicatum variant of the coastal shrub, is a low-growing, evergreen plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, white powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for coastal gardens. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it an excellent plant for stabilizing sandy or rocky soils."
