    "intro": "Hydnophytum normale, commonly known as the common hydnophytum, is a tropical climbing plant belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique root system that forms symbiotic relationships with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, allowing it to thrive in nutrient-poor soils. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically opposite and ovate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Hydnophytum normale is often found in lowland rainforests and is adapted to humid, shaded environments."
