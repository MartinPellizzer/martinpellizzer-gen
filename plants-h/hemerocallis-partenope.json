    "intro": "Hemerocallis partenope, commonly known as the Naples daylily, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. The plant typically blooms in late summer, with each flower lasting only one day, hence its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy choice for garden landscapes. Hemerocallis partenope is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to naturalize in suitable climates."
