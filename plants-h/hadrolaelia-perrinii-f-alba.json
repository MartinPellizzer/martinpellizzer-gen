    "intro": "Hadrolaelia perrinii f. alba, commonly known as the white form of the alpine orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its elegant, white flowers with a subtle pinkish hue. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that help it adapt to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a delicate and endangered species."
