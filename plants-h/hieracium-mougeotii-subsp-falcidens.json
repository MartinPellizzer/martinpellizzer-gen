    "intro": "Hieracium mougeotii subsp. falcidens, commonly known as the narrowleaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough, hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
