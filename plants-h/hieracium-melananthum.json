    "intro": "Hieracium melananthum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dark green, hairy leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native plants and is sometimes considered a weed."
