    "intro": "Haplopappus macreanus, commonly known as the rough pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive bracts. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small, yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by fluffy, seed-bearing structures that aid in wind dispersal."
