    "intro": "Haloragis glauca, commonly known as blue star, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is a member of the Haloragaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant features small, star-shaped blue to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in a fine, silvery-blue coating, which helps reflect sunlight. Haloragis glauca thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats."
