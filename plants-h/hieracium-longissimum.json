    "intro": "Hieracium longissimum, commonly known as the long-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. Its flowering stems rise from the center of the rosette, bearing yellow disk flowers surrounded by pale green to white ray florets. Hieracium longissimum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
