    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum subsp. violaceum, commonly known as the violet rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its fleshy, evergreen leaves and showy, violet-pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The subspecies is distinguished by its more intense floral coloration compared to the typical form of Helianthemum apenninum."
