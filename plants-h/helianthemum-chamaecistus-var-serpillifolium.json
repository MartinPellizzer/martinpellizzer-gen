    "intro": "Helianthemum chamaecistus var. serpillifolium, commonly known as the rock rose or dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features compact, mat-forming growth with small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments."
