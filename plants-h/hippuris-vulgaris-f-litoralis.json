    "intro": "Hippuris vulgaris f. litoralis, commonly known as the sea buckwheat, is a variant of the water pennywort. It is a low-growing, aquatic plant that typically thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in shallow, slow-moving waters. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers. It is characterized by its ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
