    "intro": "Houstonia polypremoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf blue-eyed grass, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its delicate, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
