    "intro": "Heteromorpha arborescens var. montana, commonly known as the mountain heteromorpha, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine soils. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are usually pink or red in color, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are often hairy and have a distinctive shape, which helps it retain moisture in its arid habitat. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
