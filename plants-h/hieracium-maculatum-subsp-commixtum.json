    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. commixtum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish to reddish flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native plant species."
