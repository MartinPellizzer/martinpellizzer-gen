    "intro": "Huperzia shresthae, commonly known as the Nepal clubmoss, is a rare and ancient fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, scale-like leaves that form dense, compact clusters. Native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and India, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests. Its spore-bearing structures, known as sporangia, are typically found on the underside of its leaves. Huperzia shresthae is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and its role in understanding the evolution of early land plants."
