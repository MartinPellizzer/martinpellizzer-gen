The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a vibrant touch to its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value and hardy nature make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking drought-tolerant plants."
