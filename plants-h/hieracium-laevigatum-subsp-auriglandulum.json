    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. auriglandulum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, and it has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy texture. It produces small, elongated achenes that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive, rounded flower heads and the presence of glandular structures on its stems and leaves."
