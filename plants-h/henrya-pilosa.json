    "intro": "Henrya pilosa, commonly known as the silver leaf henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, silvery-white foliage that provides a striking contrast against its dark green stems. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink or white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for ornamental horticulture."
