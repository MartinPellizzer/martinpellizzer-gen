    "intro": "Habenaria lithophila subsp. mossii, commonly known as the mossy lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is a lithophytic plant, meaning it grows on rocks rather than in soil, typically in shaded, humid environments. The plant features a dense, grass-like foliage and produces delicate, spiraling inflorescences with small, white to pale pink flowers. Its botanical characteristics include a rhizomatous root system and specialized structures for nutrient absorption from its rocky substrate. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas."
