    "intro": "Harveya purpurea subsp. sulphurea, commonly known as the sulphur harveya, is a striking member of the Boraginaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vivid purple and yellow flowers, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually hairy and lance-shaped, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Harveya purpurea subsp. sulphurea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
