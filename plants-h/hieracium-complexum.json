    "intro": "Hieracium complexum, commonly known as the complex hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
