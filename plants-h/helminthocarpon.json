It is characterized by its crustose or foliose growth form and typically exhibits a pale to dark green or yellowish coloration. The genus is known for its complex chemical composition, including various secondary metabolites such as usnic acid and atranorin. Helminthocarpon species often grow on bark, soil, or rock surfaces in temperate and boreal regions. These lichens play an important role in ecological systems by contributing to soil formation and serving as indicators of air quality."
