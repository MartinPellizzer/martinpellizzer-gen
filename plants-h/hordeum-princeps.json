    "intro": "Hordeum princeps, commonly known as the wild barley, is a species of grass native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with two to three flowers per spikelet. Hordeum princeps is an important model organism in plant genetics due to its genome being fully sequenced. It plays a significant role in agricultural research and is also valued for its ecological contributions in natural habitats."
