    "intro": "Heliconia ramonensis var. glabra, commonly known as the Ramon Glabrous Heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting various pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy coating, which helps in reducing water loss in its humid tropical habitat. This variety is notable for its smooth, glabrous texture on the bracts, distinguishing it from other Heliconia species."
