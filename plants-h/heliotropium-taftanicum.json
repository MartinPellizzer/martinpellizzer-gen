    "intro": "Heliotropium taftanicum, commonly known as Taft's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant produces small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Heliotropium taftanicum is typically found in moist, shaded areas such as forest floors and rocky crevices."
