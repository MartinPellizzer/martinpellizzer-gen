    "intro": "Hieracium similatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, typically growing in open areas such as meadows and woodland edges. The plant has basal leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. It is native to Europe but has been introduced to other parts of the world, including North America. Hieracium similatum is a perennial herb that can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain environments."
