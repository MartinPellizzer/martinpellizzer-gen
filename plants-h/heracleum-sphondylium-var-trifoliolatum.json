    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. trifoliolatum, commonly known as the three-leaf cow parsnip, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often trifoliate, giving it its specific name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in umbels, which bloom in late summer. Its stems are hairy and can grow up to 2 meters tall, and the roots are thick and fleshy. This variety is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is considered a member of the carrot family (Apiaceae)."
