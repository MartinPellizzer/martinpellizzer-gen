    "intro": "Helianthemum halimifolium var. planifolium, commonly known as the flat-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are broad, fleshy, and often covered in a fine white coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant. This plant is well adapted to coastal and sunny environments, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens."
