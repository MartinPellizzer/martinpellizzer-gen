    "intro": "Hedypnois taraxaci, commonly known as the common dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of toothed leaves and a hollow, hairy stem that supports a single flower head. The flower head consists of numerous yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. After flowering, it produces a distinctive seed head called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This plant is widely distributed across temperate regions and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
