    "intro": "Haageocereus versicolor var. catacanthus, commonly known as the cat's claw cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators. Its foliage is typically reduced to spines, with the stems serving as the primary photosynthetic structure. This variety is well adapted to hot, dry environments and requires minimal water once established."
