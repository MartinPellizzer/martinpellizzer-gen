    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocorymbosum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which is characteristic of the genus Hieracium. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly in new environments."
