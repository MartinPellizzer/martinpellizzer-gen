    "intro": "Hieracium parile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium parile is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
