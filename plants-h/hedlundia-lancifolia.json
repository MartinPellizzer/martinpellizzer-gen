    "intro": "Hedlundia lancifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hedlundia, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a pointed tip and a serrated margin, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. Its small, fragrant flowers are typically white or pale pink and appear in clusters at the ends of the stems. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
