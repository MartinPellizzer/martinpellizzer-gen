    "intro": "Huernia longituba, commonly known as the long-stemmed moon cactus, is a succulent belonging to the Apocynaceae family. It is native to southern Africa, particularly Namibia and Botswana, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features thick, ribbed stems that store water, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a distinctive tubular shape. It produces small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
