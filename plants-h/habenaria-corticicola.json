    "intro": "Habenaria corticicola, commonly known as the bark orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant features a rhizomatous root system and possesses lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, hairy coating. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive greenish-yellow color and a spurred lip. This orchid is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
