    "intro": "Hieracium faucisjovis, commonly known as the Jupiter's throat, is a species of flowering plant in the dandelion family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has a short flowering period in late spring to early summer. Its common name is thought to be derived from its association with the Roman god Jupiter."
