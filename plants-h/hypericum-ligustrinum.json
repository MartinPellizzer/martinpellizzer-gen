    "intro": "Hypericum ligustrinum, commonly known as St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer and are accompanied by orange-red glands on the petals. Its flowering period coincides with the summer months, and it is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its antidepressant and anti-inflammatory effects."
