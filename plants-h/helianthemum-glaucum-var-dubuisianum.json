    "intro": "Helianthemum glaucum var. dubuisianum, commonly known as the Dubuisianum rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
