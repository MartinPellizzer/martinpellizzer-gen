    "intro": "Heliconia sampaioana, commonly known as the Sampaio's heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that are often hidden within the bracts. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
