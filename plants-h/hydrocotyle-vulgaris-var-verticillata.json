    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. verticillata, commonly known as water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, and has finely divided, floating leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are usually borne on slender stems. Its leaves are characterized by their distinctive, whorled arrangement around the stem, which gives it a unique appearance. Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. verticillata is often used in water gardens and can also serve as a food source for aquatic invertebrates."
