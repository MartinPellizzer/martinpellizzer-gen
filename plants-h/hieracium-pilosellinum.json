    "intro": "Hieracium pilosellinum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
