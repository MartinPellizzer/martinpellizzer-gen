    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. golicae, commonly known as the Golica's spear thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and sometimes toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in a spherical inflorescence called a capitulum. It thrives in open, rocky, or grassy habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a relatively rare and localized species."
