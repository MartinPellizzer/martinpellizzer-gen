    "intro": "Hedera amurensis, commonly known as Japanese ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to eastern Asia. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded environments and is often used as a ground cover or climbing plant in horticulture. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
