    "intro": "Hieracium tatewakii, commonly known as Tatewaki's hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Tatewaki's hawkweed is considered a vulnerable species."
