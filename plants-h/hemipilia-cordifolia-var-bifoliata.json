    "intro": "Hemipilia cordifolia var. bifoliata, commonly known as the two-leaved heartleaf orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist habitats, often in forest understories where it relies on specific mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its flowers, which bloom in spring, are usually pale green or white with a subtle fragrance, making it a sought-after species among orchid enthusiasts. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
