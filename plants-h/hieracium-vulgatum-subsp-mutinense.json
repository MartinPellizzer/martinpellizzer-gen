    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. mutinense, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stem is upright and branched. It produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is characterized by its smaller flower heads and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
