    "intro": "Hieracium pseudorepandum, commonly known as the false mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it easily identifiable, though it can be confused with other Hieracium species due to similar foliage and floral structures."
