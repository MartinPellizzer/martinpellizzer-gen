It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and simple, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically borne in clusters, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in tropical rainforests and is often found in lowland to hill forest regions. Hopea modesta is valued for its hard, durable wood and is also studied for its ecological role in forest ecosystems."
