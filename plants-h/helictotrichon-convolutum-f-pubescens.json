    "intro": "Helictotrichon convolutum f. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent bluegrass, is a cool-season grass characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and fine, bluish-green foliage. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in well-drained, loamy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to greenish flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its pubescent (hairy) leaves and stems distinguish this form from other varieties of Helictotrichon. It is often used in turfgrass mixtures for its durability and aesthetic appeal."
