It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers display a mix of white and yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
