    "intro": "Heterocentron floribundum, commonly known as the clustered starflower, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in early spring. The plant has a low-growing habit with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid habitats. Its flowers are usually blue or violet in color, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Heterocentron floribundum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
