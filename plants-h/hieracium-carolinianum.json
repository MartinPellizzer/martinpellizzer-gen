    "intro": "Hieracium carolinianum, commonly known as the Carolina hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodlands, and it produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Hieracium carolinianum is also known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
