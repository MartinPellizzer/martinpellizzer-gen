    "intro": "Horkeliella congdonis, commonly known as the Congo orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within the rainforest canopy. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, and it has a unique symbiotic relationship with certain fungi. Due to its limited habitat and threats from deforestation, Horkeliella congdonis is considered critically endangered."
