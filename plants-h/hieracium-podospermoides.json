    "intro": "Hieracium podospermoides, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Its vegetative growth is rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and form dense mats in suitable habitats."
