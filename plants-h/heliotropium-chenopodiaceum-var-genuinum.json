    "intro": "Heliotropium chenopodiaceum var. genuinum, commonly known as the coastal heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in saline environments. This species is adapted to withstand high salt exposure and strong coastal winds, making it a resilient component of coastal ecosystems."
