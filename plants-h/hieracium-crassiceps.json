    "intro": "Hieracium crassiceps, commonly known as the broad-headed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright stems with alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often hairy. Its showy yellow flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium crassiceps is often considered a weed due to its invasive growth habit in certain regions."
