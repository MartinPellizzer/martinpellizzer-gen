    "intro": "Hepetis glymiana, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or wetlands. Hepetis glymiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
