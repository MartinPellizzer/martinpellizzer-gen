    "intro": "Heliophila incisa, commonly known as the narrowleaf water plantain, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, featuring elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system helps stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Heliophila incisa is valued for its ecological role in supporting aquatic life and its use in wetland restoration projects."
