    "intro": "Hieracium capsellifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and serrated, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often found in temperate climates and can be invasive in certain regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
