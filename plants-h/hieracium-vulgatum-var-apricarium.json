It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flower heads consist of both ray and disk florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This plant is often considered a weed but has some ornamental value due to its distinctive foliage and flowers."
