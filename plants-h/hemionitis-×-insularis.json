    "intro": "Hemionitis \u00d7 insularis, commonly known as the island hemionitis, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Hemionitis arifolia and Hemionitis arifolia var. insularis. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically bright green. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
