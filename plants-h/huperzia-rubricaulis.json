    "intro": "Huperzia rubricaulis, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of primitive vascular plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and distinctive, reddish-brown stems that contrast with its dark green leaves. Native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant's sporangia are clustered in terminal spore cones, a feature typical of its ancient lineage. Huperzia rubricaulis plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its natural habitat."
