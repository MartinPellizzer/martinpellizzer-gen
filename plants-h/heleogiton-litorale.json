    "intro": "Heleogiton litorale, commonly known as the coastal bellflower, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dune environments. It has hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Heleogiton litorale plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for various pollinators."
