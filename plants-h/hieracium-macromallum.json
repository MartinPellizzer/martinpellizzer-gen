    "intro": "Hieracium macromallum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow with prominent central disks. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions and can outcompete native vegetation."
