    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolainzii, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
