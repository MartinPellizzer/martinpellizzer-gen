    "intro": "Helianthemum umbellatum var. subdecumbens, commonly known as the creeping sunrose, is a low-growing succulent plant native to southern Europe. It features fleshy, rounded leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
