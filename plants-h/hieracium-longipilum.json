It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets. Hieracium longipilum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
