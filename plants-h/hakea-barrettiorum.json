    "intro": "Hakea barrettiorum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces cylindrical flower spikes that range in color from pink to red, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Hakea barrettiorum is often used in garden settings for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
