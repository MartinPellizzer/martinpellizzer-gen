    "intro": "Hieracium chamaeadenium subsp. stenanthelum, commonly known as the narrow-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish to orange flowers. It produces achene fruits that are often surrounded by bracts, a common trait in the Asteraceae family. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
