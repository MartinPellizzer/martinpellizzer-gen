    "intro": "Heliotropium toratense, commonly known as the tropical heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with hairy stems and opposite leaves. Its flowers are borne in clusters at the ends of the branches, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Heliotropium toratense is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and gardens, where it can spread readily."
