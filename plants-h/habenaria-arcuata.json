    "intro": "Habenaria arcuata, commonly known as the curved-veined orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink with intricate veining. The plant produces a single spike bearing several small, showy blooms, and its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The orchid is notable for its specialized pollination mechanisms, which involve specific insect species."
