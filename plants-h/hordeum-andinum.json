    "intro": "Hordeum andinum, commonly known as Andean barley, is a species of grass native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant produces hard, pale grains that are adapted to thrive in cold, arid environments. It is often found in Andean mountain ranges at elevations above 3,000 meters. Hordeum andinum has been historically used by indigenous communities for both food and traditional medicine."
