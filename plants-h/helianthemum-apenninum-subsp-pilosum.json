It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has grey-green, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found on rocky slopes and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
