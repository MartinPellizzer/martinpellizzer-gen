    "intro": "Helianthemum montanum subsp. vineale, commonly known as the alpine rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, showy yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually small, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and specific floral characteristics compared to other members of the genus."
