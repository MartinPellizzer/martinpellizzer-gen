    "intro": "Heliotropium fedtschenkoanum, commonly known as the Fedtschenko's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy violet to purple flowers. The plant typically produces small, hairy leaves and has a branching structure that allows it to thrive in rocky, alpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and is often found in meadows and slopes at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
