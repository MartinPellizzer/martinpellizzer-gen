It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its distinctive white to pale yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration compared to other hawkweed varieties. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
