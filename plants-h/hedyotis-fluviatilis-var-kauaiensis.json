    "intro": "Hedyotis fluviatilis var. kauaiensis, commonly known as Kauai's water pepper, is a rare endemic species native to the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It is a low-growing herbaceous plant that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine, glandular hairs. Its flowers are small and white or pale green, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Due to habitat loss and invasive species, this plant is critically endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
