    "intro": "Hieracium subimbricatum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by tubular florets. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Hieracium subimbricatum is often found in moist soils and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
