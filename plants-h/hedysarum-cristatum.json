    "intro": "Hedysarum cristatum, commonly known as the crown vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. It is often used in erosion control due to its extensive root system and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. Hedysarum cristatum thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
