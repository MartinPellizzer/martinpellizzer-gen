It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it is often found in high-altitude areas where competition from other plants is minimal. Hieracium elaphrum is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable conditions."
