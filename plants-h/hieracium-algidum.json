    "intro": "Hieracium algidum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc. Hieracium algidum is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions at high altitudes."
