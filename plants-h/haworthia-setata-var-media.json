    "intro": "Haworthia setata var. media, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically narrow and pointed, often with white or pale markings. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the growing season. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
