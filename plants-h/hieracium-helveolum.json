    "intro": "Hieracium helveolum, commonly known as the Swiss hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of small, yellowish to brownish flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a soft texture. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can pose a challenge in ecological management."
