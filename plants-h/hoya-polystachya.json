    "intro": "Hoya polystachya, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can grow up to 10 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Hoya polystachya thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
