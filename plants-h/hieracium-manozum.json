    "intro": "Hieracium manozum, commonly known as the Manozum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. Native to southern Europe and parts of the Mediterranean, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Its pollen is a significant source of allergens, contributing to hay fever in sensitive individuals."
