    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. megalobium, commonly known as the large-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow, daisy-like flowers with ray florets. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and have a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
