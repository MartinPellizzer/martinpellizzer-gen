    "intro": "Huperzia tetrastichoides, commonly known as the forked moss huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has a short, upright stem with whorled leaves that are usually dark green and leathery in texture. Its reproductive structures, known as sporangia, are clustered on the undersides of the leaves, contributing to its spore dispersal. Huperzia tetrastichoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ability to thrive in humid, shaded conditions."
