    "intro": "Henriettea spruceana, commonly known as the Spruce's henriettea, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, evergreen leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil, often found in rocky or mountainous terrain. Henriettea spruceana is noted for its ornamental value, with its vibrant pink or purple blooms appearing in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
