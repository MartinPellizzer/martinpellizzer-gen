    "intro": "Helianthemum apertum var. longisepalum, commonly known as the long-sepal sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and rocky habitats. This variety is distinguished by its elongated sepals, which give it its scientific name."
