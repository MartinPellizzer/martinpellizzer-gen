    "intro": "Heracleum massyciticum, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a tall, biennial or perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in umbrella-like inflorescences, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. Its stem is covered with coarse hairs and has a milky sap that can cause severe skin irritation. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
