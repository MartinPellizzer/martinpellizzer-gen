    "intro": "Hibiscus adscensionis, commonly known as the Ascension Island hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the remote Ascension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is a shrub that typically grows in coastal areas and on rocky outcrops, adapting to the island's unique climate. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellow or red center. Its leaves are heart-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy texture, which helps reduce water loss in the arid environment. Hibiscus adscensionis is an important part of the island's flora and is considered a rare species due to its limited geographic distribution."
