    "intro": "Helichrysum alucense, commonly known as the alpine everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after blooming, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and cold-hardy, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Helichrysum alucense is also valued for its aromatic foliage and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
