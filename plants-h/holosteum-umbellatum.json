    "intro": "Holosteum umbellatum, commonly known as the umbrella lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale blue flowers on tall, branching stems. The flowers are typically arranged in an umbellate pattern, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Holosteum umbellatum is often used in rock gardens and as a decorative plant due to its delicate appearance."
