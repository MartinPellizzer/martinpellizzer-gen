    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. subconfertum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology, particularly in the density and structure of its hairy foliage."
