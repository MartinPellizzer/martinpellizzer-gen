    "intro": "Hieracium baileyanum, commonly known as the Baileyanum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
