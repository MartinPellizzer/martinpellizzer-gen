    "intro": "Hemionitis adiantoides, commonly known as the water fern, is a small, aquatic plant native to the wetlands of eastern Asia. It has delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of the true ferns, though it belongs to the order Schizomatales. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving water, often forming dense mats on the surface. Its rhizomes are submerged, anchoring the plant and absorbing nutrients from the water. Hemionitis adiantoides is known for its ability to tolerate a range of water conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
