    "intro": "Haplopappus reticulatus, commonly known as the net-veined pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in the spring, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Haplopappus reticulatus is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun conditions."
