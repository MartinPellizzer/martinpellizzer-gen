It is a low-growing perennial with slender, branching stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations such as reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Howellia limosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
