    "intro": "Hakea longistyla, commonly known as the long-styled hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like foliage and produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous small, hard seeds. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, appearing in spring, and it is an important component of local ecosystems. Hakea longistyla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
