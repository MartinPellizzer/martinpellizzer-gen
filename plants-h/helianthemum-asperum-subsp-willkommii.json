    "intro": "Helianthemum asperum subsp. willkommii, commonly known as the rough sandwort, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has hairy, gray-green leaves that are typically arranged in a dense, compact form. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
