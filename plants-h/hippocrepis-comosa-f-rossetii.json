    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa f. rossetii, commonly known as the Rossetti's tufted orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, tufted foliage and showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in cool, humid microclimates. Its unique floral structure and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and climate change, it is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for its protection."
