    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracussion subdiminuens, commonly known as the diminutive hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves and yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and disturbed soils. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including parts of North America. Due to its small size and delicate appearance, it is often mistaken for other hawkweed species but can be distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and flowering pattern."
