    "intro": "Hieracium acidotum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium acidotum is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in high doses."
