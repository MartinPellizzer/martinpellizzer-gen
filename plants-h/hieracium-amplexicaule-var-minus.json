    "intro": "Hieracium amplexicaule var. minus, commonly known as the small-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with basal leaves that are broad and often clasping the stem, giving it its specific epithet *amplexicaule*. The plant produces yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence known as a capitulum. Its leaves are usually covered in fine hairs, and the stems are generally hairy as well. This variety is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
