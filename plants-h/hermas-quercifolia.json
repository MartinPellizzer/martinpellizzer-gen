    "intro": "Hermas quercifolia, commonly known as the oakleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that resemble oak leaves, which are typically dark green with a slightly hairy underside. The plant produces showy clusters of white or pink flowers in the summer, which gradually change color as the season progresses. Its growth habit is compact, making it suitable for small gardens or as a hedge. Hermas quercifolia is relatively low maintenance and thrives in partial to full shade with moist, well-drained soil."
