    "intro": "Helicia insularis, commonly known as the island helicia, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by edible, round fruits that are often consumed by birds and mammals. Helicia insularis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of the ecosystems in its native habitat."
