It belongs to the family Bignoniaceae and is characterized by its striking white to pale yellow flowers that resemble those of the genus Ipomoea. The plant has opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves, and its flowers are typically clustered in racemes. Humboltia hymenantha produces small, woody capsules as fruits, which contain numerous tiny seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its showy blooms and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates."
