    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 asperilanceolatum, commonly known as the hybrid stonecrop, is a succulent plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered flowers that range from yellow to orange in color. The plant thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for Mediterranean climates. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in a powdery waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. This hybrid species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense, low-growing mats."
