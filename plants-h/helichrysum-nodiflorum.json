    "intro": "Helichrysum nodiflorum, commonly known as the clustered everlasting or nodding goldenrod, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to golden-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has wiry, branched stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum nodiflorum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
