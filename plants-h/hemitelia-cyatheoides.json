    "intro": "Hemitelia cyatheoides, commonly known as the giant tree fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is characterized by its large, feather-like fronds that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant has a thick, fibrous trunk that stores water and nutrients, supporting its growth in humid, shaded environments. Its reproductive structures include spore-bearing cones, which are typically found on the underside of the fronds. Hemitelia cyatheoides plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various species."
