    "intro": "Hieracium piloselliflorum subsp. microsphaericum, commonly known as the small-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its small, spherical flower heads and hairy stems. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant in certain regions."
