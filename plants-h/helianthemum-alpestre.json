    "intro": "Helianthemum alpestre, commonly known as the alpine sunflower, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It produces small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It typically grows in rocky soils and is well adapted to cold climates. Helianthemum alpestre is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
