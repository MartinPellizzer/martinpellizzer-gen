    "intro": "Humboltia orbicularis, commonly known as the broadleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, orbicular (rounded) leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow or orange. The plant thrives in humid, warm climates and is often found in lowland forests or near water sources. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by birds and insects, and the plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Humboltia orbicularis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
