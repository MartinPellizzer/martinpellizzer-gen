    "intro": "Helichrysum manopappoides, commonly known as the golden crown, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny crowns. The plant produces papery, bract-like structures that give it a distinctive appearance, often mistaken for actual petals. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
