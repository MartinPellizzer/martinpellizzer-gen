    "intro": "Helogyne ferreyrae, commonly known as the Ferreyra's helogyne, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial plants. The plant is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence that resembles a spiral, with vibrant red and orange bracts. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
