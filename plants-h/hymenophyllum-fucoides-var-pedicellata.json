    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fucoides var. pedicellata, commonly known as the pedicellate wall moss, is a small, epiphytic fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, creeping rhizomes and dense, cushion-like growth habit. The leaves are narrowly lanceolate, with a distinct midrib and a serrated or toothed margin. The sporangia are clustered in small, stalked clusters called pedicels, which give the variety its name. This variety is often found on tree trunks and rocks in tropical and subtropical regions."
