    "intro": "Hakea bipinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a bipinnate pattern. The plant produces bright red or orange cylindrical flower spikes, which are typically borne at the ends of the branches. It is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments. Hakea bipinnatifida is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
