    "intro": "Hoya montelbanensis, commonly known as the Montelban hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its waxy, thick leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its flowers, which typically bloom in shades of white and pink, are fragrant and attract pollinators such as moths and bees. Hoya montelbanensis is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
