    "intro": "Helianthus canescens, commonly known as the grayhead sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its gray-green foliage and showy yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and has a sprawling, bushy habit. Its scientific name reflects its fibrous, hairy stems and the sunflower family to which it belongs. Helianthus canescens is often found in open woods, prairies, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
