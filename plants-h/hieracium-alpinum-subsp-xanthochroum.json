    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. xanthochroum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are basal and rosette-like, with a rough, hairy texture that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. This subspecies is known for its hardy nature and ability to withstand cold temperatures and strong winds."
