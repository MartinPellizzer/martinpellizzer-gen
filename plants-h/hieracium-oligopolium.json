    "intro": "Hieracium oligopolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Native to Europe, it often thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora, making it a concern in ecological management."
