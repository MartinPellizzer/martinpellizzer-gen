It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and prairies. Its botanical features make it an important component of native grassland ecosystems."
