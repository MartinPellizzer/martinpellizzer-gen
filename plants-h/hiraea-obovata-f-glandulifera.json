    "intro": "Hiraea obovata f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-leaved hiraea, is a variant of the hiraea plant characterized by its glandular features on the leaves and stems. This plant belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes species known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often hairy or glandular surfaces. The leaves are typically obovate, meaning they are broad at the tip and taper toward the base, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. The glandular structures on the leaves may serve to deter herbivores or aid in water retention. It is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or along stream banks."
