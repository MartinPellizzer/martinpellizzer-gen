    "intro": "Hohenbergia belemii, commonly known as the Belem hohenbergia, is a striking epiphytic plant native to Brazil. It features broad, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a bluish-green hue and prominent veins. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences bearing small, white or pale pink flowers. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardens."
