    "intro": "Hibbertia dilatata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Australia. It belongs to the family Dilleniaceae and is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with red stamens. The plant typically grows in heathlands and rocky areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Hibbertia dilatata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
