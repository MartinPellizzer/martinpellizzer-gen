    "intro": "Hieracium dovrense var. amitsokense, commonly known as the Amitsokens Hill Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Carpathians. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The flowers are typically bright yellow, with ray florets and a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
