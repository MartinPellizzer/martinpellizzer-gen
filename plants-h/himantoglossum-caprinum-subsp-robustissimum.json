The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and somewhat woody at the base. This subspecies is notable for its robust growth compared to other members of the species, making it a resilient plant in harsh mountain environments."
