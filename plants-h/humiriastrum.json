    "intro": "Humiriastrum, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants native to arid regions of the Americas. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy foliage. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to withstand drought conditions. Humiriastrum species often have a rosette growth habit, with leaves that are fleshy and covered in fine hairs. They play an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in desert ecosystems."
