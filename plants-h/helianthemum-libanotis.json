    "intro": "Helianthemum libanotis, commonly known as the Lebanon sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the rocky regions of the eastern Mediterranean. It features small, fleshy leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid and semi-arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils."
