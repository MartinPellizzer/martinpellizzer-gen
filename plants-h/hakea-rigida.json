    "intro": "Hakea rigida, commonly known as the rigid hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its woody, spiny stems and dense clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea rigida is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions. Its structure and growth habits make it an important component of native vegetation in its habitat."
