    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. lineare, commonly known as the linear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are linear and slightly hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and seed production."
