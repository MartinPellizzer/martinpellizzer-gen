    "intro": "Hulsea algida, commonly known as the coldweed, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and alpine regions of the northern hemisphere. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its small, delicate flowers and low-growing habit. The plant thrives in cold, rocky environments and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Hulsea algida plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is an indicator species for cold and nutrient-poor environments."
