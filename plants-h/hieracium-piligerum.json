    "intro": "Hieracium piligerum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
