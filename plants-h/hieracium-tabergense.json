    "intro": "Hieracium tabergense, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposures. It has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
