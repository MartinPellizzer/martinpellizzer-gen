    "intro": "Hieracium permutatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough textures. Hieracium permutatum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
