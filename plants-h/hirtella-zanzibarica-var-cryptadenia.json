    "intro": "Hirtella zanzibarica var. cryptadenia, commonly known as the Zanzibar hirtella, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers, which are often fragrant and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, aiding in its dispersal. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
