    "intro": "Himantoglossum calcaratum var. robustissimum, commonly known as the robust rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and limestone-rich habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems bearing showy, spurred orchid flowers with a distinctive greenish-yellow coloration. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade conditions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
