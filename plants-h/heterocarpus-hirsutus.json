    "intro": "Heterocarpus hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy mangrove, is a tropical plant native to the Indo-Pacific region. It is a halophyte, meaning it thrives in saline environments such as mangrove swamps and tidal flats. The plant has aerial roots called pneumatophores that help it absorb oxygen from the waterlogged soil. Its leaves are typically thick and waxy, adapted to reduce water loss in salty conditions. The flowers are small and clustered, with both male and female parts, allowing for self-pollination in its often isolated habitat."
