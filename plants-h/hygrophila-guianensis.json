It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in whorls around the stem. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting various pollinators. Hygrophila guianensis is valued in aquariums for its ornamental appearance and ability to oxygenate water."
