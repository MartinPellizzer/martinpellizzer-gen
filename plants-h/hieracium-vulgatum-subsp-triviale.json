It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of small, daisy-like flowers. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
