    "intro": "Hohenbergia humilis, commonly known as the dwarf bromeliad, is a compact, evergreen plant native to Brazil. It features rosettes of narrow, dark green, sword-shaped leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences with bright red bracts that contrast beautifully with its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia humilis is well-suited for indoor cultivation and adds a touch of elegance to any space."
