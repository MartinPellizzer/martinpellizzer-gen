    "intro": "Habenaria transsilvanica, commonly known as the Transylvanian butterfly orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Europe, particularly Romania and the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and its delicate, butterfly-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. It produces a single spike of flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
