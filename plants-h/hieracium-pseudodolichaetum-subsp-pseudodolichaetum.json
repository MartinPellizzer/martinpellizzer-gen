    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodolichaetum subsp. pseudodolichaetum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry meadows, grasslands, and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features upright, hairy stems that can reach up to 40 cm in height, and its basal leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Its yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are arranged in a single head and are surrounded by pale green ray florets. This subspecies is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and is often found in open, disturbed habitats."
