    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. chlorophyllotropum, commonly known as the green-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, chlorophyll-rich foliage, which gives it its common name. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
