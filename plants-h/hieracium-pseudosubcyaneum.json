    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosubcyaneum, commonly known as the blue false dandelion, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its blue to purple flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers develop into small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. It is often mistaken for true dandelions due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its color and habitat preferences."
