    "intro": "Hieracium tjaelderense, commonly known as the Tjaelder hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along dunes and coastal cliffs, thriving in saline and windy conditions. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and the plant is notable for its robust growth and ability to colonize disturbed coastal habitats. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
