    "intro": "Hieracium isomeles, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale green or white ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium isomeles is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a common weed in agricultural areas."
