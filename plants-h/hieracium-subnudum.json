    "intro": "Hieracium subnudum, commonly known as the naked-stem hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It has slender, hairy stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium subnudum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in many regions."
