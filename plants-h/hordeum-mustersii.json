    "intro": "Hordeum mustersii, commonly known as the desert barley, is a grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect growth habit and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant produces narrow, linear leaves and has a fibrous root system adapted to survive in dry environments. Hordeum mustersii is drought-tolerant and thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
