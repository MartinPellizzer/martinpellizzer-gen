    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. subinsignitum, commonly known as the dark-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves that are often tinged with purple or red. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are composed of numerous small florets arranged in a disc-like structure. The subspecies is distinguished by its darker, more pronounced leaf hairs compared to other members of the species."
