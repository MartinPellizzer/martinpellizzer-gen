    "intro": "Helianthemum apenninum var. argentatum, commonly known as the silver-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring, often in clusters at the ends of its branches. The plant has silver-gray foliage due to a dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or limestone areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance in landscaping."
