    "intro": "Hydrangea villosa var. strigosior, commonly known as the roughleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its fuzzy, strigose leaves that give it its varietal name. The plant produces clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade. Its ornamental value comes from its foliage and showy inflorescences, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens."
