It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with prominent sepals and petals. It typically blooms in late summer to early autumn, and its growth is often found in moist, shaded forest understories.
