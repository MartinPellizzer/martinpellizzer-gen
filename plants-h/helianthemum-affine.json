It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky environments. It is often found in coastal areas, slopes, and disturbed soils, showcasing its resilience to harsh conditions. Its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
