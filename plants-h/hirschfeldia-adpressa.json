    "intro": "Hirschfeldia adpressa, commonly known as the flat sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming annual plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It has small, pale green, oval-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well adapted to sandy and rocky soils. Hirschfeldia adpressa is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats, where it plays a minor but ecologically significant role."
