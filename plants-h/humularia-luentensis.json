    "intro": "Humularia luentensis, commonly known as the Luentean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue petals and is typically found in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often associated with forested areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
