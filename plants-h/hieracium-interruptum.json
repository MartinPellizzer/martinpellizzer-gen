    "intro": "Hieracium interruptum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the daisy family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers with prominent yellow centers, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and disturbed soils. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
