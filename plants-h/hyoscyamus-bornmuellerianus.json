    "intro": "Hyoscyamus bornmuellerianus, commonly known as the desert thornapple, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant produces small, spherical berries that contain toxic seeds, making it potentially harmful to livestock and humans. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert and semi-desert environments. Due to its hardiness, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its use is limited due to its toxic properties."
