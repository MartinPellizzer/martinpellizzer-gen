    "intro": "Haplopappus subandinus, commonly known as the Andean hairgrass, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are adapted for wind dispersal, a common strategy in arid and mountainous environments. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, hair-like structures, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Haplopappus subandinus is often found in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters."
