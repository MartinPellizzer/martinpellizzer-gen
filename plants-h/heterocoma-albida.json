    "intro": "Heterocoma albida, commonly known as the white milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Heterocoma albida plays a role in supporting local pollinators, including bees and butterflies."
