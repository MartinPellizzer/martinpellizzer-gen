    "intro": "Heliophila chamaemelifolia, commonly known as the creeping heliophyte, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, allowing it to efficiently capture sunlight. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and wetlands. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies and habitat restoration."
