    "intro": "Habenaria tentaculata var. acutifolia, commonly known as the acute-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are sharply pointed, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. It typically grows in wet, boggy habitats and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
