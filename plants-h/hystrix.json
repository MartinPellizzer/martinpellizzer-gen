    "intro": "Hystrix, commonly known as the porcupine or hedgehog plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Aizoaceae. It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its unique, spiny foliage that resembles the quills of a porcupine. The leaves are typically fleshy and succulent, adapted to store water in arid environments. Hystrix species often produce small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These plants are popular in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental appeal."
