    "intro": "Hieracium conferciens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can form dense mats due to its stolons. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. However, it is considered invasive in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
