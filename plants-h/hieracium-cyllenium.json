    "intro": "Hieracium cyllenium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are accompanied by rough, hairy stems and basal leaves. Hieracium cyllenium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
