It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium aeruginascens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
