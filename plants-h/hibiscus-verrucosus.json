It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. The plant has hairy, rough-textured leaves that give it its common name, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hibiscus verrucosus is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
