    "intro": "Hieracium polycymum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a dense cluster. Hieracium polycymum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
