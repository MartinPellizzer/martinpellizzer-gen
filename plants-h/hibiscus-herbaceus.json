    "intro": "Hibiscus herbaceus, commonly known as the velvetleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant is herbaceous, meaning it has soft, non-woody stems that die back in colder seasons. Hibiscus herbaceus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its striking foliage and vibrant blooms."
