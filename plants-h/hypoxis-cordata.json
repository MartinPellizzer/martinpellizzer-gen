    "intro": "Hypoxis cordata, commonly known as the star grass or false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, dark green leaves with a distinctive white midrib. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hypoxis cordata is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional African medicine."
