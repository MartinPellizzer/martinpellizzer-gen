    "intro": "Hedyotis pinifolia var. caespitosa, commonly known as the creeping knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of Asia. It features small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, yellowish-green flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense mats, which can help prevent soil erosion. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
