    "intro": "Hemionitis palmata, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a unique aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Asia. It has distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that float on the water surface, with a thick waxy cuticle that helps prevent water loss. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the early morning, often before sunrise. Its roots are submerged, anchoring it in shallow waters and absorbing nutrients from the sediment. Hemionitis palmata is culturally significant in many Asian countries and is also valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties."
