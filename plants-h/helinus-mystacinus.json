    "intro": "Helinus mystacinus, commonly known as the African moonflower, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its large, white, night-blooming flowers. The plant produces a fragrant scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, often with a waxy texture. The flowers typically open at night and close by dawn, adapting to the plant's unique photoperiodic behavior."
