    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum var. comosum, commonly known as the woolly bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to violet. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces numerous small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
