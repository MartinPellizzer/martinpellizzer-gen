    "intro": "Hymenothrix autumnalis, commonly known as the autumn thorn, is a shrub native to parts of southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has small, ovate leaves with serrated edges, and its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of natural fibers."
