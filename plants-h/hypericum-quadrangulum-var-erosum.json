    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. erosum, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is characterized by its woody stems and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Its medicinal properties are attributed to the presence of hypericin and other flavonoids."
