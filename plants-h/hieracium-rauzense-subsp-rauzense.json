    "intro": "Hieracium rauzense subsp. rauzense, commonly known as the Rauzense Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its robust growth and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the local flora. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
