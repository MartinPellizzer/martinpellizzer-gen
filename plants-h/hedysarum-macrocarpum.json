It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive, large, hairy pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and grassland habitats. Hedysarum macrocarpum plays a role in soil stabilization and provides forage for wildlife and livestock."
