    "intro": "Heliotropium inaguense, commonly known as the Inagua heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean, particularly found on the Inagua Islands of the Bahamas. It is a low-growing shrub with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in the summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal and dune environments. Heliotropium inaguense plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for small invertebrates."
