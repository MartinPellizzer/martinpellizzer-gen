    "intro": "Hesperantha pilosa subsp. pilosa, commonly known as the hairy spider lily, is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family. It is native to South Africa, particularly the Western Cape region, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a purple or red throat. Its leaves are long, narrow, and often covered in fine hairs, giving it the \"hairy\" descriptor in its common name. This subshrub is typically found in coastal and mountainous areas, and it blooms during the spring and summer months."
