    "intro": "Hemigenia subvillosa, commonly known as the woolly hemigenia, is a small shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as heathlands and woodlands. Hemigenia subvillosa is a valuable plant for pollinators and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
