    "intro": "Hilsenbergia teitensis, commonly known as the Easter lily, is a flowering plant native to the island of Easter Island. It is characterized by its striking white, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces a tall, slender stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardens. Despite its beauty, it is relatively rare in the wild and requires careful cultivation to ensure its survival."
