    "intro": "Hugonia mystax, commonly known as the water nettle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in the Americas. It features slender, erect stems that are often covered in fine hairs and can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a serrated margin, and small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in loose spikes. Its root system is fibrous, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Hugonia mystax is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
