It is characterized by its square, woody stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in the summer, which are composed of numerous small, tubular petals. Hypericum quadrangulare is typically found in moist, woodland habitats and is often used in native plant gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
