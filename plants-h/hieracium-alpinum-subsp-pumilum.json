    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. pumilum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically forms dense mats of grass-like foliage with small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid, high-altitude habitat. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Its botanical features make it a characteristic species of alpine meadows and subalpine zones."
