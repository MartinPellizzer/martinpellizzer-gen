    "intro": "Hermannia erecta, commonly known as the upright hermannia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, often with opposite leaves that are lance-shaped and slightly hairy. Its flowers, which can be white, pink, or red, are adapted for pollination by insects, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Hermannia erecta thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
