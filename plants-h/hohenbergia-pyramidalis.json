    "intro": "Hohenbergia pyramidalis, commonly known as the Pyramidal Hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are dark green with a waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences that bear showy, long-lasting flowers in shades of red, orange, and yellow. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia pyramidalis is popular among plant enthusiasts for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
