    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. subgracilipediforme, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, often hairy stems and lanceolate leaves that are typically less robust than those of the main species. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in flat-topped clusters, typical of the genus Hieracium. This plant thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, and it is often found in moist, temperate climates."
