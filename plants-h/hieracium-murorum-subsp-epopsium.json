    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. epopsium, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of spoon-shaped, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. The species is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
