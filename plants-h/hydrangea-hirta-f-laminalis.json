    "intro": "Hydrangea hirta f. laminalis, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hydrangea, is a botanical variant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical hydrangea hirta, with leaves that are generally smaller and more elongated. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale blue flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its unique foliage and delicate blooms make it a desirable ornamental plant in horticultural settings."
