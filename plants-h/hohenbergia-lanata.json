    "intro": "Hohenbergia lanata, commonly known as the woolly hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, woolly white or silver-gray trichomes that cover the leaves, giving it a unique appearance. The plant typically forms a rosette of broad, fleshy leaves that can grow up to 30 centimeters in length. It produces showy, bell-shaped inflorescences in shades of red, orange, or yellow, which bloom in the spring. Hohenbergia lanata is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its tolerance for low light and minimal water requirements."
