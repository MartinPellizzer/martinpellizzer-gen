    "intro": "Helichrysum cladochaetum, commonly known as the golden everlasting or mountain everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant long after blooming. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Helichrysum cladochaetum is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
