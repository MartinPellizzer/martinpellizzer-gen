    "intro": "Hakea obtusa, commonly known as the broad-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and its distinctive, broad, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange cylindrical flowers that are typically arranged in clusters, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea obtusa is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with its deep root system allowing it to access water from deeper soil layers. It is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought."
