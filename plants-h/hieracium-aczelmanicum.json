    "intro": "Hieracium aczelmanicum, commonly known as the Acelman's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 centimeters, featuring dark green, heart-shaped basal leaves and hairy stems. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
