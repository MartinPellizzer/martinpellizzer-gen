    "intro": "Hieracium thermophilum, commonly known as the thermophilic hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils, preferring warm climates. Its yellowish flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale green to white ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium thermophilum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
