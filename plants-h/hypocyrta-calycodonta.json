    "intro": "Hypocyrta calycodonta, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become invasive in certain environments."
