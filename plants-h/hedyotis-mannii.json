    "intro": "Hedyotis mannii, commonly known as the African mosquito plant, is a small evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom throughout the warmer months. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and container planting. Hedyotis mannii is drought-tolerant and prefers well-drained soil, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments."
