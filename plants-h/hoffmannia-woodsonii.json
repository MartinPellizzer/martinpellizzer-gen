    "intro": "Hoffmannia woodsonii, commonly known as the Woodson's hoffmannia, is a rare and striking member of the Malvaceae family. It is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico, specifically the Sierra Madre Occidental. The plant is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from pink to white, often with a distinct yellow or orange center. Its leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plant grows as a shrub or small tree. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hoffmannia woodsonii is considered a conservation concern."
