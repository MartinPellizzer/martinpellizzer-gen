    "intro": "Hedysarum pallasii, commonly known as Pallas's vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Hedysarum pallasii plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. It is valued in ecological restoration projects for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
