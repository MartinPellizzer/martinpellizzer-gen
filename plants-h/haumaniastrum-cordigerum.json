    "intro": "Haumaniastrum cordigerum, commonly known as the red sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Verbenaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in sandy or gravelly soils. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Haumaniastrum cordigerum is often found in disturbed areas and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and limited water availability."
