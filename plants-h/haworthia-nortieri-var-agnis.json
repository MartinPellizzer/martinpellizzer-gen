    "intro": "Haworthia nortieri var. agnis, commonly known as the Agnes Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct markings. The leaves are adorned with white to yellowish tubercles and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale yellow during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water and well-draining soil."
