    "intro": "Hymenophyllum aucklandicum, commonly known as the Auckland haircap, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, hair-like fronds that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or in dense forests. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant is notable for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in humid, tropical climates."
