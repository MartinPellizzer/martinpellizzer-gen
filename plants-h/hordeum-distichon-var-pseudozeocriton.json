    "intro": "Hordeum distichon var. pseudozeocriton, commonly known as the desert barley, is a variant of the barley species native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, typical of the Hordeum genus. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in regions with low precipitation. Due to its drought tolerance, it is of interest for potential use in dryland agriculture and ecological restoration."
