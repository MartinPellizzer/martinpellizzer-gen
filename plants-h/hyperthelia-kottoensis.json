    "intro": "Hyperthelia kottoensis, commonly known as the Kottoensis hyperthelia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical Africa, particularly found in countries such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems, which are typical of many species in the Rubiaceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
