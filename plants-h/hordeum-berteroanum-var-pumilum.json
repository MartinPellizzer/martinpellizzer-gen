    "intro": "Hordeum berteroanum var. pumilum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a small, annual grass species native to South America. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is characterized by its compact growth habit and short, narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its seeds are generally used for animal feed or as a forage crop in arid regions. Due to its hardiness, it is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in low-nutrient environments."
