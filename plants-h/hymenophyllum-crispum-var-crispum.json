    "intro": "Hymenophyllum crispum var. crispum, commonly known as the curled rock fern, is a small, delicate fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its finely divided, leathery fronds that are often curled or twisted, giving it a unique appearance. The plant belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is typically found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sorus. This species is notable for its ability to retain moisture and its preference for high humidity and indirect light."
