    "intro": "Hubbardia, commonly known as the candle plant, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, making it drought-tolerant. Its leaves are typically opposite and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the species. Hubbardia produces small, clustered flowers that are often white or pink, and it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
