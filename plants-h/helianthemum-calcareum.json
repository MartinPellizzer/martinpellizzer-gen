    "intro": "Helianthemum calcareum, commonly known as the limestone rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically thrives in rocky, limestone-rich soils. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it well-suited for xerophytic environments, and it is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
