    "intro": "Hieracium heterogynum subsp. substupposum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a dense cluster of disk flowers, which are tubular and often visited by pollinators. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescence compared to other members of the species."
