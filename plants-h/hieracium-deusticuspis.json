    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium deusticuspis, commonly known as the eastern spearthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as fields and roadsides. It has a rosette of basal leaves and a tall, branched stem that bears the flower heads. Due to its spines and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
