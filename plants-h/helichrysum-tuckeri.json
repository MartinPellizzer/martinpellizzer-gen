    "intro": "Helichrysum tuckeri, commonly known as the Cape gold bush, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small sunbursts. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
