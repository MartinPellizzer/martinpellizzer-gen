    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subirriguum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing habit with numerous small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wastelands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a problematic weed in some regions."
