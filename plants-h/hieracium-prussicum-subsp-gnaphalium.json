    "intro": "Hieracium prussicum subsp. gnaphalium, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth form compared to other Hieracium species."
