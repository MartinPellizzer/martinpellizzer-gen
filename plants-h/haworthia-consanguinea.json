    "intro": "Haworthia consanguinea, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a species of flowering plant in the Asphodelaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are often marked with white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant typically grows to a height of about 10\u201315 centimeters and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It is a succulent that stores water in its fleshy leaves, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Haworthia consanguinea is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
