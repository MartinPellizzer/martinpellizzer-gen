    "intro": "Hildebrandtia austinii, commonly known as Austin's hildebrandtia, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that are typically orange or yellow in color. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Hildebrandtia austinii is often found in shaded, woodland areas and is known for its unique floral structure that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
