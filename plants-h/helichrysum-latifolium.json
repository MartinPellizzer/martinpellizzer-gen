    "intro": "Helichrysum latifolium, commonly known as the Cape gold flower, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It features bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color. The plant has silver-green, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
