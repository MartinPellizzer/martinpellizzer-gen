    "intro": "Hakea papillosa, commonly known as the silky hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers during the warmer months, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea papillosa is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
