    "intro": "Hieracium punctillaticeps, commonly known as the dotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which consist of a yellow central disk surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. Hieracium punctillaticeps is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
