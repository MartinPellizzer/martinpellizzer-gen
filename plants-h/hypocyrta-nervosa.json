    "intro": "Hypocyrta nervosa, commonly known as the veined rock fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that often have prominent venation. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Hypocyrta nervosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in shaded garden settings."
