    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lachnolina, commonly known as the woolly water pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soil, thriving in marshes and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish-white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that are dispersed by water. Hydrocotyle lachnolina plays an important role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
