    "intro": "Hippia, commonly known as the false hawthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia. The plants are shrubs or small trees with simple, alternate leaves that are often hairy or pubescent. They produce small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hippia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes used in traditional medicine."
