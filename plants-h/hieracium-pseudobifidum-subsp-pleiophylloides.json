    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobifidum subsp. pleiophylloides, commonly known as the broad-leafed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, displaying a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
