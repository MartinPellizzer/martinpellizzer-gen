    "intro": "Herniaria cinerea var. fragilis, commonly known as the fragile bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in sandy or gravelly soils. It is characterized by its small, succulent leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tiny, pale blue or white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is typically found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. Its unique ability to store water in its leaves allows it to survive in arid conditions."
