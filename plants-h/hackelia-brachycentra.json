It is a member of the Scrophulariaceae family, characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has small, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Hackelia brachycentra is often found in open woodlands and grasslands, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
