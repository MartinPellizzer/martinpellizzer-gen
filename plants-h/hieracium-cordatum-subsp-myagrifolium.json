    "intro": "Hieracium cordatum subsp. myagrifolium, commonly known as the heartleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
