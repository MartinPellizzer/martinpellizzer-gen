    "intro": "Hugueninia tanacetifolia proles suffruticosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, wiry stems that root at the nodes, forming a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue or violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly rough texture, and it thrives in well-drained, sunny to partially shaded environments. This plant is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
