    "intro": "Helleborus bocconei subsp. istriacus, commonly known as the Istrian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth texture. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent, showy nectaries that attract pollinators. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
