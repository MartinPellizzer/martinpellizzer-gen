It is characterized by its slender, often reddish stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
