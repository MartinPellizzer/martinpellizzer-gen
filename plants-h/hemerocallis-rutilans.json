    "intro": "Hemerocallis rutilans, commonly known as the golden daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern Asia. It features strap-like, grass-like leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The flowers are typically borne in clusters on tall, branching stems and bloom for a short period each day, hence the name \"daylily.\" It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The plant is widely cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
