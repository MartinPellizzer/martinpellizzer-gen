The plant has small, narrow leaves covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color and texture."
