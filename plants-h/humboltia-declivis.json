It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Humboltia declivis thrives in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats, often growing on slopes and cliffs. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native wildlife species."
