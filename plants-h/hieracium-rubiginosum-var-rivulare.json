    "intro": "Hieracium rubiginosum var. rivulare, commonly known as the river hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along riverbanks and wet meadows. It has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with high moisture levels and is considered a characteristic species of riparian ecosystems."
