It typically thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and dry, open habitats. The plant has small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its flowers are small, white or pale pink, and are clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. Herniaria micrantha is known for its ability to tolerate harsh conditions, making it a hardy and resilient species."
