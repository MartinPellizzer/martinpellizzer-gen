    "intro": "Helianthemum almeriense subsp. scopulorum, commonly known as the rock sunflower, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Spain and Portugal. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas with a Mediterranean climate. The plant features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a splash of color to its harsh habitat. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
