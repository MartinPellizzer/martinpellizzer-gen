    "intro": "Hepetis pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered heath, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or heathland environments. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of pale blue or purple flowers. Its flowers are tubular and adapted for pollination by insects, particularly bees. Hepetis pauciflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local pollinator populations."
