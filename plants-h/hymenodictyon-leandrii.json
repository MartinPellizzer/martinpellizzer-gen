It belongs to the family Olacaceae and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. The plant produces small, round, red fruits that contain a single seed, which is enclosed in a hard, fibrous coat. Hymenodictyon leandrii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showing resilience to drought conditions. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies in its native habitat."
