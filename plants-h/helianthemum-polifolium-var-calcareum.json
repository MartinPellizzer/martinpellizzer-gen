    "intro": "Helianthemum polifolium var. calcareum, commonly known as the limestone rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The plant thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its leaves are narrow and linear, with a slightly rough texture, and it is drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in harsh, sunny conditions."
