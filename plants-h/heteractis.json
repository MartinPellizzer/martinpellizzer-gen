    "intro": "Heteractis, commonly known as the sea pen, is a genus of marine cnidarians belonging to the order Pennatularia. These organisms are characterized by their branching, calcareous structures that resemble the shape of a pen, hence their common name. They are typically found in shallow tropical and subtropical waters, often attached to the substratum. Heteractis species are colonial, with each individual polyp contributing to the overall structure. Their botanical significance lies in their role as indicators of healthy coral reef ecosystems."
