    "intro": "Hymenopappus corymbosus var. nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's thistle, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb with a robust taproot and spiny, lobed leaves that are typically grayish-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in dense, branched clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its bracts are covered in fine hairs, and the seeds are dispersed by wind due to the presence of pappus structures. This species is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in dry slopes and rocky soils."
