    "intro": "Hedyotis racemosa, commonly known as the slender bladdernut, is a perennial herb native to eastern North America. It typically grows in moist, wooded areas and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy undersides. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in terminal racemes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Hedyotis racemosa is often found in shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
