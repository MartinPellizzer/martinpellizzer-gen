    "intro": "Hymenophyllum mettenii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are covered in a fine, silvery coating of trichomes. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in shaded forest areas. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum mettenii is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in humid, shaded gardens."
