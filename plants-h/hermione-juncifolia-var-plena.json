    "intro": "Hermione juncifolia var. plena, commonly known as the full-flowered rush, is a decorative grass native to southern China. It features dense, upright clumps of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often used in landscaping for their ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of small, fluffy white flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a soft, cloud-like effect to gardens. It prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it suitable for wetland gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and seasonal blooms make it a popular choice for creating texture and visual interest in garden designs."
