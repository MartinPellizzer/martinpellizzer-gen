    "intro": "Haworthia retusa subsp. asperula, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features striking, narrow, white to pale blue tubercles that contrast with its dark green foliage. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, enabling it to thrive in arid conditions. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and container cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
