    "intro": "Hedysarum cinereum, commonly known as the blue flax or blue peavine, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pale blue to violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum cinereum is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in nitrogen fixation, benefiting soil fertility."
