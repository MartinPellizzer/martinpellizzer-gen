    "intro": "Hedyotis marginata, commonly known as the coastal hedyotis, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis marginata is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds, making it a hardy and resilient species."
