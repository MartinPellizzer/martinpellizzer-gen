    "intro": "Hakea biternata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or cylindrical-branching structure and its distinctive, recurved leaves. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in winter, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea biternata is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
