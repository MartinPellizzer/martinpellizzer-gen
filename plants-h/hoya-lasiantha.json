    "intro": "Hoya lasiantha, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Vine,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically thick, leathery, and arranged in a rosette pattern, which helps the plant conserve moisture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya lasiantha is also known for its slow growth and ability to produce fragrant blooms throughout the year."
