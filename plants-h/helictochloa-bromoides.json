    "intro": "Helictochloa bromoides, commonly known as the bristlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and dense,\u4e1b\u751f\u7684 foliage that often forms a low, mat-like structure. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, awned florets. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry environments. Helictochloa bromoides is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats."
