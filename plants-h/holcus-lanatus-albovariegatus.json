    "intro": "Holcus lanatus albovariegatus, commonly known as the white-variegated quaking grass, is a variant of the common quaking grass. It is characterized by its distinctive white and green variegation on the leaves, which sets it apart from the typical green form. This plant is a member of the grass family (Poaceae) and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant produces small, feathery inflorescences that give it a delicate, swaying appearance."
