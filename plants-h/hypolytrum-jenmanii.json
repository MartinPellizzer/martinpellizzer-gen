    "intro": "Hypolytrum jenmanii, commonly known as the Jenman's lily, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and orange. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces inflorescences that are often clustered at the base. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest margins or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
