    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum f. sejunctum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, exhibiting a low-growing habit with clustered stems. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. This form is distinguished by its more compact growth and clustered inflorescence compared to the typical form of H. vulgatum."
