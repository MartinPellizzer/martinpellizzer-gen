It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It is part of the Hypericaceae family and is characterized by its ability to thrive in shaded to partially sunny conditions. Hypericum helodeum is also noted for its medicinal properties, though it contains compounds that can be toxic if ingested in large quantities."
