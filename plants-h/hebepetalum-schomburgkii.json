    "intro": "Hebepetalum schomburgkii, commonly known as the Schomburgk's ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its unique, ghost-like appearance with pale greenish-white petals and a prominent, elongated lip. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom during the cooler months, typically from July to September. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, moist environments, often in understorey vegetation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
