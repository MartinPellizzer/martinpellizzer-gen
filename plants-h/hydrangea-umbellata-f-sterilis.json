    "intro": "Hydrangea umbellata f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile form of the broadleaf hydrangea, is a unique variant of the hydrangea species. This plant is characterized by its lack of reproductive structures, meaning it does not produce flowers or seeds. Botanically, it exhibits the typical morphological features of the species, including large, showy bracts that resemble flowers. The leaves are generally large, ovate, and have a smooth or slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes."
