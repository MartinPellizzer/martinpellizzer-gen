It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features hairy, silver-gray leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine, white pubescence. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disk, blooming from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium sericatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes."
