    "intro": "Helianthemum fugax, commonly known as the transient rockrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in early spring, which are often clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a common sight in rocky or coastal habitats. Its short lifespan and rapid growth cycle contribute to its ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
