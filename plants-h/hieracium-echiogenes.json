    "intro": "Hieracium echiogenes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium echiogenes is often considered a weed due to its invasive potential in certain regions."
