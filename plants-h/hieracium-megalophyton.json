    "intro": "Hieracium megalophyton, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, supporting large, showy yellow flower heads. The plant has basal and alternate leaves that are usually hairy and lance-shaped, with a rough texture. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it is considered an invasive species in many regions."
