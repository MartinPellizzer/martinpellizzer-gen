    "intro": "Hieracium guilligenum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium guilligenum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
