    "intro": "Hebeclinium, commonly known as the New Zealand rock daisy, is a genus of flowering plants native to New Zealand. It belongs to the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its small, showy flowers and hairy stems. The plants typically grow in rocky or alpine environments, adapting to the harsh conditions of their native habitat. Hebeclinium species often have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce clusters of yellow or white flowers. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their hardiness and beauty."
