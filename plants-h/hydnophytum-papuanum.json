    "intro": "Hydnophytum papuanum, commonly known as the Papuan ghost orchid, is an epiphytic plant native to the rainforests of Papua, Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, often translucent leaves and lack of traditional roots. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient absorption. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species."
