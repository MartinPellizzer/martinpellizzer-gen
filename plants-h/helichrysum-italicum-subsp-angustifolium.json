    "intro": "Helichrysum italicum subsp. angustifolium, commonly known as narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is a perennial shrub with a compact growth habit and aromatic leaves that emit a subtle, spicy scent. Its leaves are narrow and linear, and the flowers are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. This subspecies is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought and poor soil conditions."
