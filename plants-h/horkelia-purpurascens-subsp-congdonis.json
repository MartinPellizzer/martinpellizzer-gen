    "intro": "Horkelia purpurascens subsp. congdonis, commonly known as Congdon's horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its showy, purple to pink ray flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils in open habitats such as meadows and slopes. It has basal leaves that are often woolly and hairy, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is relatively rare and is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics."
