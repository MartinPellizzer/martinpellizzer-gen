    "intro": "Hieracium inuloides subsp. inuloides, commonly known as the meadowhawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring moist, well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange composite flowers, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk florets. The leaves are generally hairy and alternate, with a rough texture that aids in water retention."
