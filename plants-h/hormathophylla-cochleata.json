    "intro": "Hormathophylla cochleata, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a unique species of aquatic fern found in the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive spiral arrangement of fronds, which gives it a striking, curling appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often in shaded, moist habitats. Its fronds are typically narrow and elongated, with a leathery texture and a bluish-green color. Hormathophylla cochleata plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and contributing to water quality through nutrient cycling."
