    "intro": "Hesperidanthus suffrutescens, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous annual with small, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant has hairy, succulent stems and leaves that are typically opposite and ovate. Its seeds are enclosed in a capsule that splits open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Hesperidanthus suffrutescens is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water availability."
