    "intro": "Hymenoxys chrysanthemoides, commonly known as the yellow coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features showy, daisy-like yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with hairy stems and leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to arid environments and suitable for drought-tolerant gardens."
