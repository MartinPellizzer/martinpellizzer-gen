    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bakeri, commonly known as the basket moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that form a dense, moss-like carpet. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are usually less than 10 cm in length and have a unique, lacy appearance. Hymenophyllum bakeri is known for its ability to retain moisture, which is essential for its survival in its moist, shaded habitat."
