    "intro": "Huperzia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to Southeast Asia. It is a small, low-growing plant that typically reaches heights of less than 10 centimeters. The plant features simple, linear leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, produce spores that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation."
