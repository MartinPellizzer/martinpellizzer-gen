    "intro": "Hedyotis senegalensis, commonly known as the Senegalese pennywort, is a small herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along riverbanks. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface and produces small, white or greenish flowers. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release tiny seeds when mature. Hedyotis senegalensis is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
