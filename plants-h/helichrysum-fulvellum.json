    "intro": "Helichrysum fulvellum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and its showy, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers. The plant produces composite flowers composed of many tiny florets, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant properties. Helichrysum fulvellum thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes."
