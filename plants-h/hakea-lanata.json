    "intro": "Hakea lanata, commonly known as the woolly hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a bluish-gray hue due to the presence of fine hairs. Hakea lanata is adapted to arid conditions and is commonly found in coastal and sandy soils."
