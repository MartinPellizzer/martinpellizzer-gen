It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is part of the Asteraceae family and is adapted to cold climates with short growing seasons."
