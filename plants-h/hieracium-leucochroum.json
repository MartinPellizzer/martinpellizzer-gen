    "intro": "Hieracium leucochroum, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a white center. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native plants."
