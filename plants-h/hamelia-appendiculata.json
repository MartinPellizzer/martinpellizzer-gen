    "intro": "Hamelia appendiculata, commonly known as the flame beater or red flamebush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and dense foliage. The plant produces vibrant red or orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and have a rough texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Hamelia appendiculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in full sun to partial shade."
