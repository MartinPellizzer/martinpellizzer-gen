It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with four petals, typically blooming in late summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, yellowish glands, which are characteristic of the Hypericaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens and natural habitats."
