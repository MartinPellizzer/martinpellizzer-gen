    "intro": "Hieracium parabolicum, commonly known as the parabolic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive heart-shaped base, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium parabolicum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient weed and a potential indicator of soil disturbance."
