It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its delicate, woolly leaves and showy, pinkish-purple flowers.

Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
