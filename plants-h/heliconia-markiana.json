    "intro": "Heliconia markiana, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its striking, inflorescence-like structure composed of brightly colored bracts. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Heliconia markiana thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its unique appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens."
