    "intro": "Hydrocotyle vulgaris var. umbrosa, commonly known as the shade-leaf umbrella plant, is a variant of the water pennywort species. It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often darker in color due to its preference for shaded environments. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped with a waxy surface, and it produces small, white flowers in the summer months. This variant is adapted to low-light conditions and is often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
