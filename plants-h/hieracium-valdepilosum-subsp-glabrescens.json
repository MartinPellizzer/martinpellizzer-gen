    "intro": "Hieracium valdepilosum subsp. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are generally smooth and glabrous, giving it its subspecific name. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. It is often found in temperate climates and is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads."
