    "intro": "Hieracium scytalocephalum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage and dandelion-like yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, aiding in its spread. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habits."
