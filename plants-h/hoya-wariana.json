    "intro": "Hoya wariana, commonly known as the wax plant or sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, including regions of India, Thailand, and the Philippines. The plant is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. Hoya wariana is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in low-light conditions make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
