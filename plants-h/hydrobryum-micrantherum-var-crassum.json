    "intro": "Hydrobryum micrantherum var. crassum, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh moss, is a species of liverwort found in wet, boggy environments. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form. The plant has elongated, narrow leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, papillate cells. It thrives in acidic, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores into the air."
