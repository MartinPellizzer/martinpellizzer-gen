    "intro": "Hakea endlicheriana, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical spikes of bright yellow flowers that appear in spring. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are often narrow and arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Hakea endlicheriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
