    "intro": "Hieracium pseudolasiophyllum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to certain regions of Europe and is often found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Due to its ornamental features and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some areas."
