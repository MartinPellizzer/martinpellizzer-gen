    "intro": "Halenia, commonly known as the \"water plantain,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Alismataceae. It typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers that bloom in clusters. These plants are aquatic or semi-aquatic, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. Halenia species are characterized by their rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They play an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
