    "intro": "Habenaria brownelliana, commonly known as the Brownell's orchid, is a species native to the Caribbean, particularly found in Jamaica and the Bahamas. It is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, erect stem and elongated, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple with a yellow lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
