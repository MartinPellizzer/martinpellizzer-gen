    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. divergentidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and serrated, narrow leaves. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. It has a creeping rootstock and produces numerous flowering stems that bear small, clustered flowers. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
