It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and have a distinctive serrated edge, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Small yellow flowers appear in clusters during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This subspecies is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
