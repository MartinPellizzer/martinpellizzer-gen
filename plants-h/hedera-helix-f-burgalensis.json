    "intro": "Hedera helix f. burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalensis ivy, is a cultivar of the common ivy plant. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically larger than those of the standard Hedera helix. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It is a vigorous climber that thrives in shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value. This variety is valued for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil conditions."
