    "intro": "Hosta densa, commonly known as the dense hosta, is a perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its broad, dark green leaves that are densely packed, giving it a lush, full appearance. The plant typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 feet and thrives in partial to full shade. Its foliage is often variegated, featuring white or yellow margins that add visual interest. Hosta densa is a popular choice for shady garden beds due to its ornamental leaves and low maintenance requirements."
