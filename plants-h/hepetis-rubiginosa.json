    "intro": "Hepetis rubiginosa, commonly known as the spotted knapweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and its purple to pinkish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its scientific name reflects its reddish-brown markings on the leaves, which are a distinctive feature. Hepetis rubiginosa is an annual or biennial plant that plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
