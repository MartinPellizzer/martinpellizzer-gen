    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. kraettlii, commonly known as the Alpine mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
