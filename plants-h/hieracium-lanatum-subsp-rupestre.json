    "intro": "Hieracium lanatum subsp. rupestre, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and arid environments. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or limestone habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
