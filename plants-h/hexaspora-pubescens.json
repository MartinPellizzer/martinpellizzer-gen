It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Hexaspora pubescens is known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it an important component of certain ecosystems."
