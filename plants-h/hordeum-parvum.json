    "intro": "Hordeum parvum, commonly known as mouse barley, is a small annual grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has slender stems and small, spike-like inflorescences that produce numerous tiny grains. Its seeds are usually dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution. Botanically, it is closely related to other members of the Poaceae family, including cultivated barley."
