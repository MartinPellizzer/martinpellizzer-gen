    "intro": "Humboltia lamellaris, commonly known as the flatleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of red, yellow, or white. The plant has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Humboltia lamellaris thrives in humid, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near rivers. It is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
