    "intro": "Hieracium substellatum subsp. subaveyronense, commonly known as the Aveyron hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, silver-haired leaves and produces yellow ray flowers with a central disk. This subspecies is native to southern France, particularly the Aveyron region, and is often found in open, calcareous grasslands. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
