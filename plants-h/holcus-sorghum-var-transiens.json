It is a tall, perennial grass characterized by its robust stalks and narrow, elongated leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or purplish in color. It thrives in warm climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
