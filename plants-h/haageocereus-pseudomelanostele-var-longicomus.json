    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudomelanostele var. longicomus, commonly known as the long-stemmed night bloomer, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its leaves are reduced to spines, and it stores water in its fleshy stems. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
