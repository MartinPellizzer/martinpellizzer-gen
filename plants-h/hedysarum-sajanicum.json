    "intro": "Hedysarum sajanicum, commonly known as the Sajan milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces pods that contain several seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Hedysarum sajanicum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitats."
