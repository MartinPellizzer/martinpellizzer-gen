    "intro": "Holcus annuus subsp. setiglumis, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats in moist, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically covered with short, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. This subspecies is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats."
