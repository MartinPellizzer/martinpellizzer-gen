    "intro": "Hieracium antygophyllum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium antygophyllum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various habitats."
