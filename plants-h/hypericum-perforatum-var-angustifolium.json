The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often perforated, giving it the common name \"perforate,\" and it is known for its medicinal properties. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
