    "intro": "Helianthus tetrapterus, commonly known as the New Zealand sunflower, is a species native to New Zealand. It is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, yellow, daisy-like flowers and linear, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy soils. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread along shorelines. Helianthus tetrapterus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
