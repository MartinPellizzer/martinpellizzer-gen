    "intro": "Haumaniastrum timpermanii, commonly known as the Timperman's milkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the Apocynaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. This plant plays a vital role in supporting local pollinators and is adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils."
