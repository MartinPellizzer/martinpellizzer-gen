    "intro": "Hedysarum ciliare, commonly known as the silky vetch, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its small, hairy seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize disturbed areas. Hedysarum ciliare is valued for its nitrogen-fixing capabilities, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
