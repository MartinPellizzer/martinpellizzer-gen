    "intro": "Hieracium scolopodon, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk. Hieracium scolopodon is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
