    "intro": "Hieracium chrysolepis, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green or white ray florets, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium chrysolepis is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
