    "intro": "Hexalectris arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its striking, fragrant, white to pale pink flowers that form a dense, mat-like inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and grasslands. It is a perennial herb that relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchids. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
