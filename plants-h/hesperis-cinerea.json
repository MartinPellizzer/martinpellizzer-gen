    "intro": "Hesperis cinerea, commonly known as the hoary bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it a distinctive, almost frost-covered appearance. The plant produces clusters of delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Hesperis cinerea is a member of the Brassicaceae family, also known as the mustard family, and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
