    "intro": "Heterotrichum niveum, commonly known as the snow moss, is a species of moss belonging to the family Dicranaceae. It is characterized by its pale green to whitish coloration, which gives it its common name. The plant forms dense, cushion-like mats on moist, shaded forest floors, typically in temperate regions. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a smooth margin and a slightly curved tip. Heterotrichum niveum is primarily found in North America and parts of Asia, thriving in cool, humid environments."
