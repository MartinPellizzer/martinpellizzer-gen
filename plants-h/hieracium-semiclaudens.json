It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. Hieracium semiclaudens is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
