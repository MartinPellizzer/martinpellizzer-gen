    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 nothagenes, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium species, often resulting in plants with intermediate characteristics. The plant typically has basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are often visited by various pollinators. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
