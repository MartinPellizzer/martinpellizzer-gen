It belongs to the Carnobertieae tribe within the Caryophyllaceae family, characterized by its succulent leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically thrives in sandy or rocky soils, often found in coastal or arid environments. Its fleshy stems and leaves help it retain water, adapting to harsh, dry conditions. The flowers, which are usually pink or white, bloom in early spring and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
