    "intro": "Hyphaene parvula, commonly known as the dwarf date palm, is a small palm species native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its compact size, typically reaching only about 3 meters in height. The plant has a stout, unbranched trunk with a smooth, grayish-brown bark. Its leaves are pinnate, with long, narrow leaflets that give it a feathery appearance. Hyphaene parvula produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible, date-like fruits."
