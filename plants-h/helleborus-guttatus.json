    "intro": "Helleborus guttatus, commonly known as the spurred hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of down. The plant produces clusters of striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Helleborus guttatus is known for its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its toxic properties, particularly in its roots and leaves, require caution when handling or cultivating."
