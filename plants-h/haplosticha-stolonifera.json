    "intro": "Haplosticha stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender, branched stems that form dense mats on moist, shaded surfaces. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem. It reproduces through spores, which are produced in cup-like structures called gametophores. Haplosticha stolonifera is typically found in damp environments such as forest floors, rock crevices, and stream banks."
