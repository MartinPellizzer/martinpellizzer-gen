    "intro": "Hypericum orientale, commonly known as the oriental St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its flowering period coincides with the traditional St. John's Day, hence its common name. Hypericum orientale is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
