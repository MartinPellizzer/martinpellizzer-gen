    "intro": "Hoya tangerina, commonly known as the \"Tangerine Wanda,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a member of the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces small, orange-red berries that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hoya tangerina thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
