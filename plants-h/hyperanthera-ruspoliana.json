    "intro": "Hyperanthera ruspoliana, commonly known as the Ruspolian hyperanthera, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features showy, yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, adapting to the cold and arid conditions of its habitat. Hyperanthera ruspoliana is often found in rocky soils and alpine meadows, where it thrives in full sunlight."
