It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The subspecies lanosum is distinguished by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a soft, fuzzy appearance. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators."
