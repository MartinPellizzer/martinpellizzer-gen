    "intro": "Hypericum spruneri, commonly known as the creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are slightly succulent, adapted to thrive in dry, rocky soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Hypericum spruneri is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
