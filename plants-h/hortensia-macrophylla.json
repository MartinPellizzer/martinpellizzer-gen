It is characterized by its large, showy bracts that can range in color from pink to blue, depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, white flowers that are surrounded by the colorful bracts, which are actually modified leaves. It thrives in partial shade and requires moist, well-drained soil for optimal growth. Hortensia macrophylla is widely cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
