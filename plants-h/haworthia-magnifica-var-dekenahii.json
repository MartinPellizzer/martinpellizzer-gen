It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-green with white or pale green markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
