    "intro": "Helenium trollifolium, commonly known as the swamp helenium, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces striking orange to red blooms with yellow centers. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes and along stream banks. Helenium trollifolium plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in wetland environments."
