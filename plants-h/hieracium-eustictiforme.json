    "intro": "Hieracium eustictiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its yellow flowers are composed of ray florets and disk florets, and it produces achenes as its fruit. Hieracium eustictiforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
