    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus var. glomerellus, commonly known as the clustered haplopappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive foliage. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and open habitats. Its small, yellowish flowers are arranged in dense clusters, giving it its common name. The leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment."
