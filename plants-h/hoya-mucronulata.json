    "intro": "Hoya mucronulata, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically oval or heart-shaped, often with a slight curl. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, which bloom in response to bright light and proper care. Hoya mucronulata thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its low maintenance and attractive foliage."
