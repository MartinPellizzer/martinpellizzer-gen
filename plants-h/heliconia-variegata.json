    "intro": "Heliconia variegata, commonly known as the variegated heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, red flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps in moist, shaded environments. Heliconia variegata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant."
