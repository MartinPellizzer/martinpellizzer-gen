    "intro": "Holcoglossum gaoligongense, commonly known as the Gaoligong mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic species found in the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It is a terrestrial orchid with a unique morphological structure, featuring a short rhizome and a single, erect stem. The plant produces a single, showy flower with a distinctive violet or purple coloration, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is typically found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
