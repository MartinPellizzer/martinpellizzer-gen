    "intro": "Hieracium curtivittatum, commonly known as the narrow-banded hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and grasslands. Its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is often found in association with other members of the Hieracium genus, which are known for their invasive tendencies in certain regions."
