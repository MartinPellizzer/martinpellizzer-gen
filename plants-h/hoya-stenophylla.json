    "intro": "Hoya stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waxplant, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. Hoya stenophylla is a compact shrub that thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique foliage and delicate blooms make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
