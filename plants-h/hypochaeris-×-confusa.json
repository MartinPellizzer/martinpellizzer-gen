    "intro": "Hypochaeris \u00d7 confusa, commonly known as the common mouse-ear chickweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hypochaeris radicata and Hypochaeris glabrata. The plant is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are oval to lance-shaped. It produces small, yellow flowers that are typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. This species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered an invasive weed in some regions."
