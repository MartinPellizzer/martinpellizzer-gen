    "intro": "Hemionitis intermedia, commonly known as the water fern, is a small aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged or floating in still or slow-moving water. The plant has a short, creeping rhizome that helps it spread along the substrate. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a slightly waxy texture. Hemionitis intermedia is often used in ornamental aquatic gardens due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of water conditions."
