    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. cubensis, commonly known as Cuban water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has finely divided, arrowhead-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or emerge from the water. Its small, white flowers are borne in clusters and bloom throughout the growing season. It is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to oxygenate water."
