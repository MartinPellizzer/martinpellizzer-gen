    "intro": "Habenaria guilleminii, commonly known as the Guillemin's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Madagascar. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it can thrive with adequate humidity. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil, while its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like. The flowers, which can be white, pink, or purple, are often clustered and attract pollinators such as bees and flies."
