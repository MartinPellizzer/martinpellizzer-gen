    "intro": "Hydrangea virens, commonly known as the silverleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that range from white to pink and blue depending on soil pH. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into cone-like structures called corymbs. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. Hydrangea virens thrives in moist, well-drained soil and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens."
