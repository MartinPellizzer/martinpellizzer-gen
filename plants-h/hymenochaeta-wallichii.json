    "intro": "Hymenochaeta wallichii, commonly known as the Himalayan bracket fungus, is a polypore mushroom native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its hard, woody bracket-like fruiting bodies that grow on dead and decaying wood. The fungus has a pale to reddish-brown cap with a smooth or slightly fibrillose surface. It plays an important ecological role in breaking down organic matter in forest ecosystems. Hymenochaeta wallichii is often found on coniferous trees, particularly in temperate and subtropical climates."
