    "intro": "Heteropappus hispidus var. meyendorffii, commonly known as the meyendorffii variant of the hairy dandelion, is a flowering plant native to central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that develop into fluffy, white pappus structures for wind dispersal. The plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in steppe and desert environments. It has a taproot system and is adapted to arid conditions with reduced water loss through its hairy foliage. This variant is noted for its ornamental value and is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
