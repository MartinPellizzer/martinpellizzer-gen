    "intro": "Henckelia descendens, commonly known as the descending henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and rocky areas. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are usually pink or purple in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are simple, opposite, and often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Henckelia descendens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
