    "intro": "Hippocratea timorensis, commonly known as the Timor orchid, is a flowering plant native to the island of Timor in Indonesia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and green. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Hippocratea timorensis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
