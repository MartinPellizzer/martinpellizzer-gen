It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-gray leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often in the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and shady woodland areas. Its rapid growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for water gardens and landscaping."
