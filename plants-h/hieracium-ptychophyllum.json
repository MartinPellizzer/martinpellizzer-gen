    "intro": "Hieracium ptychophyllum, commonly known as the nodding hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers that are often clustered in a single umbel at the top of the stem. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
