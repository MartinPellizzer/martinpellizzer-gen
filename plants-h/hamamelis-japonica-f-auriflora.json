It is a deciduous shrub native to Japan, characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that turn a brilliant gold in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, spidery flowers in late autumn, adding color to the landscape when most other plants are dormant. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, acidic soil. This ornamental plant is often used in gardens for its seasonal interest and hardy nature."
