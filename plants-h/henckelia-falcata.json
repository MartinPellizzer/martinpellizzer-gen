    "intro": "Henckelia falcata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, which bloom in the spring. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
