    "intro": "Havardia sonorae, commonly known as the Sonoran ironwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Sonoran Desert of North America. It is characterized by its dark, fissured bark and dense, glossy green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in spring, which are followed by yellowish-orange pods containing seeds. It is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep roots that allow it to survive in drought-prone environments. The tree plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various desert wildlife."
