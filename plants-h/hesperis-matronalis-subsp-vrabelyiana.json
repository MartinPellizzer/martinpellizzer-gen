    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis subsp. vrabelyiana, commonly known as the Balkan candytuft, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, four-petaled flowers and capsule fruits. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical Hesperis matronalis. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or grassy habitats. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate white or pale pink blooms."
