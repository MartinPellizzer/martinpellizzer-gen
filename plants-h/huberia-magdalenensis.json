    "intro": "Huberia magdalenensis, commonly known as the Magdalen Island horkle, is a rare flowering plant native to the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, sandy soils along coastal areas and is adapted to the harsh maritime climate. It produces small white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
