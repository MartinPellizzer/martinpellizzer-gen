It is a woody vine characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Heeria pulcherrima is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
