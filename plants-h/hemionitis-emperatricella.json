It has slender, wiry rhizomes and produces small, clustered fronds with a distinctive, finely divided leaf structure. The plant is characterized by its bright green, leathery leaves that are often covered with a waxy cuticle. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Hemionitis emperatricella is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
