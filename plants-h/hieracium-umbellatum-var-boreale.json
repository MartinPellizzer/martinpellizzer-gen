    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. boreale, commonly known as the northern common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and forest edges. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are typically hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowering stems bear a dense cluster of yellow, dandelion-like flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes and is often considered an invasive weed in non-native regions."
