It is a perennial herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or inland dunes. The plant features slender, erect stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, pinkish to white flowers are arranged in spike-like clusters and bloom during the spring and summer months. Haloragis semiangulata is adapted to arid and saline environments, making it a resilient species in harsh conditions."
