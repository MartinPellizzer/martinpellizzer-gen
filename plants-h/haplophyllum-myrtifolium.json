The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in poor, sandy soils with minimal water. Haplophyllum myrtifolium is adapted to withstand extreme heat and drought, making it a resilient species in desert environments."
