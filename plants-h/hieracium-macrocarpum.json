It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, featuring upright stems covered in sticky, glandular hairs. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often have a rough texture with serrated edges. The showy yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, followed by large, hairy, yellowish-brown achenes that are dispersed by wind."
