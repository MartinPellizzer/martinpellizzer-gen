    "intro": "Hakea diminuta, commonly known as the dwarf hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It typically grows to a height of about 1 meter and features dense, needle-like leaves that are usually blue-gray in color. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea diminuta is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, demonstrating drought tolerance and efficient water use. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
