    "intro": "Holcus ventricosus, commonly known as the swollen grass or the bulge grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its robust, cylindrical stems that often appear swollen at the nodes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing greenish-white flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are broad and flat, with a rough texture, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Holcus ventricosus is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in other damp habitats."
