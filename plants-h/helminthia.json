    "intro": "Helminthia, commonly known as the common helminth, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Apiaceae. These plants are characterized by their compound leaves and umbellate inflorescences, which resemble the shape of a wheel. They typically grow in moist, temperate environments and are often found in woodland or meadow habitats. The flowers are usually small and white or greenish, and they produce small, dry fruits called schizocarps. Helminthia species are not widely cultivated but are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
