    "intro": "Henriettea, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a rare and unique plant native to the coastal regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves that resemble glass and its small, pale blue flowers that bloom in late winter. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Henriettea is known for its slow growth and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
