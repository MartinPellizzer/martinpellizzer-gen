    "intro": "Humbertiella foliosa, commonly known as the leafy fern, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, elongated fronds that are typically divided into narrow, lance-shaped segments. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Humbertiella foliosa plays a role in maintaining soil stability and providing habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
