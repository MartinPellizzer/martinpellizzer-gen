    "intro": "Hindsia ibitipocensis, commonly known as the Ibitipocense tree, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pentamerous flowers. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters, with smooth, dark green leaves that are alternate and ovate in shape. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds, aiding in its dispersal through wind or animal transport. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and poorly understood species within its native range."
