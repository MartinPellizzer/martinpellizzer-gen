    "intro": "Hydropectis aquatica, commonly known as water shield, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in North America. It has floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its roots are anchored in the sediment, and it plays a role in stabilizing water bodies. Hydropectis aquatica is often found in slow-moving waters such as ponds and lakes."
