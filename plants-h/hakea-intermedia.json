    "intro": "Hakea intermedia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, cylindrical leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that appear in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its fruit is a woody follicle that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its propagation. Hakea intermedia is well adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salty winds and sandy soils."
