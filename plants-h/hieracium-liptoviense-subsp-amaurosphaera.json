    "intro": "Hieracium liptoviense subsp. amaurosphaera, commonly known as the dark-sphere hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Basin. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette growth habit and yellow ray florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its densely packed, dark-colored flower heads, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
