It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white to pale green flowers that appear in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, with a bluish-green hue. Holcus albus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
