    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum subsp. obscurum, commonly known as the dark-flowered rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, evergreen leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to the arid and rocky environments it inhabits. The plant produces pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often found in coastal areas, limestone soils, and other well-drained habitats. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
