    "intro": "Hieracium calatharium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has a hairy stem and is often found in temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. Due to its invasive nature in some areas, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
