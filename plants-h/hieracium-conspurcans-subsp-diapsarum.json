    "intro": "Hieracium conspurcans subsp. diapsarum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow composite flowers. The plant is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of habitats, including meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
