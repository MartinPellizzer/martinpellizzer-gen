    "intro": "Hemerocallis lilioasphodelus var. fulva, commonly known as the yellow daylily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to eastern North America. It features strap-like, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has fibrous roots and broad, grass-like leaves that are typically green with a slightly glossy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. The flowers are short-lived, lasting only one day, which is characteristic of the Hemerocallis genus."
