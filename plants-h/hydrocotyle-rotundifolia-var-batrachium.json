    "intro": "Hydrocotyle rotundifolia var. batrachium, commonly known as the amphibious spurge or batrachium spurge, is a variant of the marsh spurge. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in wetland environments, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically submerged or floating, with stems that can extend into the water. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and it is known for its ability to tolerate both aquatic and terrestrial conditions. This variant is characterized by its unique leaf morphology and adaptability to fluctuating water levels."
