    "intro": "Hymenophyllum latifrons, commonly known as the broad-fronded filmy fern, is a species of epiphytic and lithophytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often covered with a fine, waxy layer to reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or on tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called soruses, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum latifrons plays a role in nutrient cycling and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
