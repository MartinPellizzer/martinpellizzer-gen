    "intro": "Hemicarex curvirostris, commonly known as the curled-beak sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, grass-like foliage. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hemicarex curvirostris typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, contributing to the ecological stability of wetland ecosystems. Its morphology and habitat preferences make it an important indicator species for wetland health."
