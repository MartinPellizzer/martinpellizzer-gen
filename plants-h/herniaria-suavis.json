    "intro": "Herniaria suavis, commonly known as sweet bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its low-growing habit and succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. Its unique feature is the presence of bladder-like structures on its stems, which are used for trapping small aquatic organisms. Herniaria suavis thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in coastal areas and wet meadows."
