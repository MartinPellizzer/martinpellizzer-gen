    "intro": "Hydrostachys humblotii, commonly known as the Madagascar waterwheel, is a herbaceous plant native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth habit and features fleshy, succulent leaves that store water, adapting it to arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the rainy season. Its roots are fibrous and can form dense mats, helping to prevent soil erosion. Hydrostachys humblotii is often found in rocky or sandy soils near water sources, making it a resilient and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
