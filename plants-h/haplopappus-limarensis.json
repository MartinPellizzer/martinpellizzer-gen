It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and typical adaptations to dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in a single head, surrounded by a pappus of bristles that aid in wind dispersal. It has small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss and thrive in sandy or gravelly soils. Haplopappus limarensis is often found in desert scrub and rocky habitats, showcasing its resilience to extreme conditions."
