    "intro": "Haenkea, commonly known as the marsh helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is native to wetlands and marshy areas in Europe and parts of Asia. The plant features dark green, strap-like leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. Haenkea is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
