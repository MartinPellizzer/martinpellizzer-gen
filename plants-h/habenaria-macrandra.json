    "intro": "Habenaria macrandra, commonly known as the large-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in Southeast Asia. It features a slender, leafy stem that typically grows up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers with a distinctive, spurred lip. Its roots are often rhizomatous, allowing it to spread and colonize moist habitats. Habenaria macrandra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
