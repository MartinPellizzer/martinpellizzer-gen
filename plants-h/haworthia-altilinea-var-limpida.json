    "intro": "Haworthia altilinea var. limpida, commonly known as the \"Limpid Haworthia,\" is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy, pale green leaves with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture. The plant produces upright, branched inflorescences with small, white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
