It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a hairy stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Its inflorescence consists of a single capitulum with tubular florets surrounded by pale yellow ray florets. Hieracium concinniflorum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
