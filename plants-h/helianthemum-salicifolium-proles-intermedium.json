    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium proles intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate willowleaf rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in its dry habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics reflect adaptations to harsh environments, with compact growth and drought tolerance."
