    "intro": "Helleborus odorus var. atrorubens, commonly known as the dark red hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its evergreen, palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and have a dark green hue. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of deep red, purple, and black, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is well-suited for woodland gardens. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care and kept away from children and pets."
