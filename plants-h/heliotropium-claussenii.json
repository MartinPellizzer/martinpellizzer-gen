    "intro": "Heliotropium claussenii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing shrub or herbaceous plant with small, clustered flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant has hairy, succulent leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the afternoon, a behavior known as heliotropism. Heliotropium claussenii is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in desert scrublands."
