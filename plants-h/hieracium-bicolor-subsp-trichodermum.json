    "intro": "Hieracium bicolor subsp. trichodermum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while the stem is usually hairy as well. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
