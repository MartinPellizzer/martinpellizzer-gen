It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed, angular stems that can grow quite tall. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its green foliage. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its unique morphology and ability to thrive in extreme conditions make it a notable species in botanical studies."
