    "intro": "Hieracium basalticum, commonly known as the basalt groundsel, is a species of flowering plant native to the volcanic regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, yellowish-green composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils, often on basaltic substrates, which contribute to its common name. Its leaves are usually gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and it produces tiny seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium basalticum is adapted to harsh, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
