    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pediaeum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. The plant has basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are creeping and bear small, yellow flowers. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. This subspecies is characterized by its low-growing habit and is often considered a weed in agricultural areas."
