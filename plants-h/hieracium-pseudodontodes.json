    "intro": "Hieracium pseudodontodes, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
