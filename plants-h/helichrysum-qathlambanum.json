It is characterized by its dense, fluffy yellow flowers that resemble small sunbursts, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant is typically shrub-like, with grey-green foliage that becomes more compact as it matures. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its resilience and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
