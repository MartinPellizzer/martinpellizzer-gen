    "intro": "Hieracium linifolium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent weed. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and plant identification."
