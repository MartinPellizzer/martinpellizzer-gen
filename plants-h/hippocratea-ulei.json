    "intro": "Hippocratea ulei, commonly known as the red-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, showy red petals and a distinctive greenish-white lip. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments within the understory of tropical forests. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the nutrient-poor soil. Its flowers bloom during the wet season, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
