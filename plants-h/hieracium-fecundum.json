    "intro": "Hieracium fecundum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Hieracium fecundum is a perennial herb that spreads through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
