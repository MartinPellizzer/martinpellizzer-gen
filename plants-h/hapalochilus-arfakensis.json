    "intro": "Hapalochilus arfakensis, commonly known as the Arfak mountain orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the highlands of West New Guinea. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces striking, showy flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments at high altitudes, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal relationships for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological significance in the region. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
