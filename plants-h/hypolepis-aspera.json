    "intro": "Hypolepis aspera, commonly known as the rough sword fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are covered in a rough, serrated texture. The fronds are typically upright and can grow up to several feet in height, making it a striking addition to shaded gardens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. This fern is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid environments."
