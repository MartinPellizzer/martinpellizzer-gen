    "intro": "Heldreichia silaifolia, commonly known as the Sila leaf bellflower, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Hellenic Mountains in Greece. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often with a white or pink throat. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to withstand the harsh mountain climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heldreichia silaifolia is considered a vulnerable species."
