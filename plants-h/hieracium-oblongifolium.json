    "intro": "Hieracium oblongifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium oblongifolium is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
