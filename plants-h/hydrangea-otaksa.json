    "intro": "Hydrangea otaksa, commonly known as the Japanese hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, blue, or purple depending on soil pH. The plant produces clusters of small, sterile flowers surrounded by larger, modified leaves called bracts. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens. Hydrangea otaksa is also valued for its ability to change flower color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
