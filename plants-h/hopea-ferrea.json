    "intro": "Hopea ferrea, commonly known as ironwood or iron tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Hopea ferrea is often found in lowland and hill dipterocarp forests, contributing to the biodiversity of these ecosystems."
