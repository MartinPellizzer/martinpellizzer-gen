    "intro": "Hicorius floridana, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep red. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along the edges of freshwater habitats, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often with a fuzzy texture, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. Hicorius floridana plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its native environment."
