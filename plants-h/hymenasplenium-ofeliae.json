    "intro": "Hymenasplenium ofeliae, commonly known as the Ofelia's spleenwort, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Pterobryaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which are clustered in sori, a feature common among ferns. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on the bark of trees or rocks in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hymenasplenium ofeliae is considered a rare and specialized species."
