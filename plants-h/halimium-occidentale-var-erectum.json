It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid environments. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
