    "intro": "Hoarea \u00d7 colvillii, commonly known as the hybrid saxifrage, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hoarea tenuis and Hoarea tenuifolia, both of which are endemic to South America. The plant features compact, rosette-like growth with hairy, fleshy leaves adapted to arid and cold environments. Its flowers are typically small and white or pink, appearing in early spring. Hoarea \u00d7 colvillii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
