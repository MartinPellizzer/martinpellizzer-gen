It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats at high altitudes. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in several European countries."
