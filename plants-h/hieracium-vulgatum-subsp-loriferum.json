    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. loriferum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellowish to orange-red flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in various environmental conditions."
