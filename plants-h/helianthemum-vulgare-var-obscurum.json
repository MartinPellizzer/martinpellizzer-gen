    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark stonecress, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to rocky and arid regions of southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short, erect stems. Its succulent leaves and compact growth habit make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions. It is often found in limestone soils and is considered a characteristic species of Mediterranean-type climates."
