It is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescence composed of brightly colored bracts that resemble a bird's beak. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts, which serve as a lure for pollinators. Its leaves are large, broad, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Heliconia lindsayana is often cultivated in warm climates for its aesthetic value and is also important in local ecosystems."
