    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 pseudovagneri, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a hybrid plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which are typically composite, consisting of both ray and disk florets. The plant forms dense mats of foliage with serrated, lance-shaped leaves. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation and alter local ecosystems."
