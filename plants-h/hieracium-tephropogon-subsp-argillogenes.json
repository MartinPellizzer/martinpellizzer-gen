    "intro": "Hieracium tephropogon subsp. argillogenes, commonly known as the clayland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, clay-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It has rough, hairy leaves and produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a characteristic species of wetland and riparian ecosystems."
