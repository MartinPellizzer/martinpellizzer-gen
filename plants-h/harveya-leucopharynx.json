    "intro": "Harveya leucopharynx, commonly known as the white-flowered harveya, is a striking member of the Gesneriaceae family native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often with a contrasting throat. The plant typically grows as a perennial shrub, featuring succulent, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. Harveya leucopharynx thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a sought-after plant among succulent and tropical gardeners."
