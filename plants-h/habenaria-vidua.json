    "intro": "Habenaria vidua, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and small, pale green to white flowers that resemble a ghostly appearance. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of tree trunks or branches without deriving nutrients from its host. It thrives in humid, shaded environments with high air humidity and moderate temperatures. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is highly sensitive to environmental changes and is considered endangered in many areas."
