    "intro": "Haplophyllum tuberculatum var. obovatum, commonly known as the woolly bladder-leaf, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy leaves that are typically obovate in shape, covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its unique appearance and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
