    "intro": "Hieracium disparile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often lobed. Its yellow flowers appear in clusters, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium disparile is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes."
