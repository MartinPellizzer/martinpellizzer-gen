    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 ochroleucum, commonly known as the hybrid rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It is a natural hybrid between Helianthemum nummularium and Helianthemum italicum, characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, often covering the foliage in a vibrant display. Its leaves are typically gray-green, covered in fine hairs, and adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize slopes in arid environments."
