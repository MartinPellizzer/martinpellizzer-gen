    "intro": "Hoya cavaleriei, commonly known as the \"Cavalerie's Waxplant,\" is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical, with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This plant is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
