    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. hemiplecoides, commonly known as the Jura hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in parts of its range."
