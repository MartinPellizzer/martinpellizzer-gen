    "intro": "Hazardia detonsa, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, succulent-like foliage. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hazardia detonsa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is well-suited to xerophytic conditions."
