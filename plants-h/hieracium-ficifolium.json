    "intro": "Hieracium ficifolium, commonly known as the ivy-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Compositae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves that resemble ivy leaves, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Hieracium ficifolium is an herbaceous perennial that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
