    "intro": "Helodium, commonly known as the \"waterwheel plant,\" is a unique aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a waterwheel, hence its common name. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its submerged leaves are typically long and ribbon-like, aiding in water flow and oxygenation. Helodium is also notable for its ability to produce oxygen through photosynthesis, contributing to the health of its aquatic habitat."
