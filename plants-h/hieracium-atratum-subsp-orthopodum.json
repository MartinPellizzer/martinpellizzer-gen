    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. orthopodum, commonly known as the dark hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers arranged in dense, flat-topped clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It has a basal rosette of leaves and can reach heights of up to 30 cm. Its subspecies status is due to subtle differences in leaf shape and flower structure compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus."
