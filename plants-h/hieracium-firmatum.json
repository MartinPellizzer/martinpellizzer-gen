    "intro": "Hieracium firmatum, commonly known as the stiff hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium firmatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a resilient and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
