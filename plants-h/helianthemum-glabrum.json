    "intro": "Helianthemum glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, adapted to retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a versatile plant for both landscape design and ecological restoration projects."
