    "intro": "Hieracium praelineare, commonly known as the early yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in early summer, and the plant produces fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium praelineare is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit and ability to colonize various habitats."
