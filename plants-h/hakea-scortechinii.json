    "intro": "Hakea scortechinii, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer to autumn. The plant is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in dry conditions. It is often found in heathlands and open woodlands, and it plays a role in providing habitat for native wildlife. Hakea scortechinii is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its unique foliage and long-lasting flowers."
