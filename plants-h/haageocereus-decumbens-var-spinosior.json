    "intro": "Haageocereus decumbens var. spinosior, commonly known as the spiny night blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a low-growing, sprawling cactus with thick, ribbed stems that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces striking white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its spiny stems provide protection from herbivores, while its succulent structure allows it to store water efficiently. This plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid environments."
