    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum subsp. phaliotrichum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and sunny exposure. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. Its inflorescence consists of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is adapted to cold climates and has a low-growing habit to withstand harsh environmental conditions."
