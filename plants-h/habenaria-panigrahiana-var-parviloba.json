    "intro": "Habenaria panigrahiana var. parviloba, commonly known as the small-lobed marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowers are often clustered in loose racemes and are pollinated by various insects, including bees and flies. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, this rare orchid is considered threatened in some regions."
