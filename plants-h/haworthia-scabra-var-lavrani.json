    "intro": "Haworthia scabra var. lavrani, commonly known as the Zulu daisy, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves with a distinctive textured surface. The leaves are covered in small, raised bumps that give the plant its rugged appearance. It produces tall, slender flower stalks bearing clusters of white or pale yellow flowers. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its hardy nature and minimal care requirements."
