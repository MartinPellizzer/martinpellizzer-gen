    "intro": "Hypolepis punctata, commonly known as the speckled shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its large, bipinnate fronds that are adorned with small, rounded sori along the margins of the pinnae. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its rhizomes are thick and fibrous, allowing it to spread and form dense colonies. The fronds are evergreen, providing a consistent ornamental appearance throughout the year."
