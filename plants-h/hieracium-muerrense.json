    "intro": "Hieracium muerrense, commonly known as the M\u00fcrren hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Alps. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous grasslands and alpine meadows, often at high altitudes. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, are arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium muerrense is noted for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid mountain habitat."
