It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 cm. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are hairy and lance-shaped, with a central flowering stem bearing yellow composite flowers. Its flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name."
