    "intro": "Hieracium crinitum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant is recognized by its hairy, reddish stems and basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are typically yellow with a central disc of tubular flowers. Hieracium crinitum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
