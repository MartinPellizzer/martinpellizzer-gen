It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in its often arid habitat. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in coastal or limestone areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh environmental conditions."
