The leaves are often marked with intricate patterns of white or pale green markings, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its compact form. This cultivar is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique aesthetics and low maintenance requirements."
