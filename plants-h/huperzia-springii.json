It is characterized by its low-growing, evergreen foliage and distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant typically forms dense mats on rocky or shaded forest floors, often in humid environments. Its sporophytes develop in clusters, producing spores in specialized structures called sporangia. Huperzia springii is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
