    "intro": "Hancea mairei, commonly known as the Maire's hancea, is a rare and endemic plant species native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in coastal or cliff habitats, where it is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to its vulnerability to habitat loss, Hancea mairei is considered threatened and requires careful protection."
