    "intro": "Hoya tannaensis, commonly known as the Tanna Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. It is a succulent vine characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are typically oval or elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming during the warmer months. Hoya tannaensis is adapted to grow in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique appearance and limited distribution make it a rare and interesting subject for botanical study."
