    "intro": "Haageocereus pseudomelanostele f. longicomus, commonly known as the long-stemmed night blooming cactus, is a rare and unique cactus species native to specific regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that can reach several meters in height, often covered in sparse, white spines. The plant produces large, white flowers that open at night, emitting a subtle fragrance to attract pollinators. Its leaves are typically reduced to small, scale-like structures, a common adaptation in arid environments. This variety is notable for its striking appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
