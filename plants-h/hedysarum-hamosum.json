It is a perennial legume that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, elongated pods that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum hamosum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration and as a forage plant. Its adaptability to various soil types and climate conditions contributes to its widespread distribution."
