    "intro": "Hieracium asclepioides, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Its showy yellow flowers, which appear in late spring to early summer, are arranged in a single head and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. Hieracium asclepioides is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
