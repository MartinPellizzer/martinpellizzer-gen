    "intro": "Hypolepis tenuifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf sword fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its slender, arching fronds that are typically 30\u2013100 cm in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping stems that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, lance-shaped pinnae that are arranged alternately along the rachis. Hypolepis tenuifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or near water sources."
