It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often covered in fine, hairy structures. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly serrated edge. Hygrophila barbata is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life."
