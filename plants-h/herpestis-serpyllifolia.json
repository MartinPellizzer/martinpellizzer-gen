    "intro": "Herpestis serpyllifolia, commonly known as hairy false brome, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, upright stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are pale green to yellowish, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom in early summer. The species is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support pollinators."
