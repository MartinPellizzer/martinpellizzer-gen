    "intro": "Hakea umbellulata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright red or orange flowers in globular clusters, which are highly attractive to nectar-feeding birds and insects. It typically grows in coastal heathlands and sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Hakea umbellulata is well adapted to harsh coastal environments and is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ornamental value."
