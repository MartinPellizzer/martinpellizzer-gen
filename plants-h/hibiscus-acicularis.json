    "intro": "Hibiscus acicularis, commonly known as the needleleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hibiscus acicularis thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well adapted to desert environments. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
