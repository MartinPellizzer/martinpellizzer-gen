    "intro": "Heliophila refracta, commonly known as the refractive heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Europe. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in wet meadows and along stream banks. Its flowers, which bloom in late summer, are typically pale blue or white, and it is known for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soil. Heliophila refracta plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
