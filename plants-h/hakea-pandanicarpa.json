    "intro": "Hakea pandanicarpa, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically green or grey-green in color. The plant produces striking, bottlebrush-like inflorescences that are usually red or pink, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions such as salt spray and strong winds. Hakea pandanicarpa is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
