    "intro": "Hydrolirion, commonly known as the water lily, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Nymphaeaceae. It is characterized by its broad, floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. Hydrolirion species are typically found in freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in the mud at the bottom of these water bodies. Its ability to thrive in aquatic environments makes it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
