It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium vexillarium is often found in open habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a notable component of its native ecosystems."
