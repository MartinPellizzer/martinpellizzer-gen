    "intro": "Hymenopappus columbianus, commonly known as the Columbian hairvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, hairy fruits called pappi, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid conditions. Hymenopappus columbianus is often found in desert scrub and grassland ecosystems."
