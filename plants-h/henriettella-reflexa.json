    "intro": "Henriettella reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed henriettella, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, and has lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a compact cluster, and bloom during the spring and early summer. Henriettella reflexa is relatively rare and has limited distribution, making it of interest to botanists and conservationists."
