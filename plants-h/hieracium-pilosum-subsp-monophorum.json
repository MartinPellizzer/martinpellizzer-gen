    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum subsp. monophorum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along riverbanks, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. The subspecies monophorum is distinguished by its relatively compact growth and fewer flowers compared to other varieties within the species."
