    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 thapsigenum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its creeping growth habit and produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed, and it can form dense mats in disturbed soils. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it is an invasive species in North America, where it outcompetes native vegetation. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread rapidly and persist in various habitats."
