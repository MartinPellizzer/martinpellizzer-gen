    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii var. bellula, commonly known as the bell-shaped Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
