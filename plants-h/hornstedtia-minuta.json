    "intro": "Hornstedtia minuta, commonly known as the dwarf hornstedtia, is a small, flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its small size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and as a container plant."
