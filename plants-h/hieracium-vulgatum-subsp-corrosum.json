    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. corrosum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, which contributes to its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. This subspecies is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
