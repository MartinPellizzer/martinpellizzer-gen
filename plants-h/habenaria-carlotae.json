    "intro": "Habenaria carlotae, commonly known as the Carolotae orchid, is a species native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with intricate markings, and it produces small, round pseudobulbs. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
