    "intro": "Hieracium tardum, commonly known as the late hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped, rough to the touch, and often have a hairy texture. The flowers bloom in late summer to early autumn, producing a yellow color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
