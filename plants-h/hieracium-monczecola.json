    "intro": "Hieracium monczecola, commonly known as the Polish hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers. The plant is native to Central and Eastern Europe and thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
