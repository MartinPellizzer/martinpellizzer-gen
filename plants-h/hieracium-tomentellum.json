    "intro": "Hieracium tomentellum, commonly known as the wooly hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has rough, hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium tomentellum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
