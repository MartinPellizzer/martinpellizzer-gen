    "intro": "Hieracium stelligerum subsp. substellatum, commonly known as the starry hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more elongated, star-like flowers compared to other members of the species. It typically grows in dry, disturbed soils in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant in certain regions."
