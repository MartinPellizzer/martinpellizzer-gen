    "intro": "Haplopappus racemosus subsp. halophilus, commonly known as the saltbush, is a shrub adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, narrow leaves that reduce water loss and enhance salt tolerance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in arid and coastal regions where soil salinity is high. This subspecies is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for wildlife."
