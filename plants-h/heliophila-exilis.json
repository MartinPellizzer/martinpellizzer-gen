    "intro": "Heliophila exilis, commonly known as slender heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Plantaginaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, often blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. Heliophila exilis is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various species."
