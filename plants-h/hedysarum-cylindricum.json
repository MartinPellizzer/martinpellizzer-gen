    "intro": "Hedysarum cylindricum, commonly known as the cylindrical milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Hedysarum cylindricum has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobia bacteria."
