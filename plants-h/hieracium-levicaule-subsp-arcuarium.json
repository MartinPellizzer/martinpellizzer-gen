    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. arcuarium, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. The plant features upright stems covered in fine, white hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its yellow flowers, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, bloom from late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and specific geographic distribution."
