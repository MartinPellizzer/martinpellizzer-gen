    "intro": "Hemionitis citrifolia, commonly known as the citron fern, is a unique tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive fronds that resemble a fern but have a unique, segmented structure. The plant features a short, underground rhizome with fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a fan-shaped appearance. Its leaves are typically dark green and have a leathery texture, while it produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia. Hemionitis citrifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to moist, shaded environments."
