    "intro": "Helleborus trifolius subsp. lividus, commonly known as the pale hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves that are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets arranged in a fan-like pattern. The plant produces clusters of pale green to white flowers with prominent, hood-like sepals that resemble a helmet. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and rocky soils. Due to its toxicity, it should be handled with care."
