    "intro": "Hypodematium nivale, commonly known as the snow lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in cold, temperate climates. It is characterized by its pale gray to white thallus, which is often covered in a fine, powdery layer. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a green alga and a fungus, contributing to its ability to survive in harsh environments. It is typically found on tree trunks, rocks, and soil in mountainous regions. Due to its slow growth and sensitivity to environmental changes, it serves as an indicator species for air quality and ecological health."
