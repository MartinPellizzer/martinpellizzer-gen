    "intro": "Helietta puberula, commonly known as the hairy helietta, is a small, herbaceous plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, a common floral arrangement in the carrot family. Helietta puberula is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
