    "intro": "Hydrocotyle javanica var. podantha, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and rounded, often with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, white or greenish flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across water surfaces, forming dense mats. It is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes."
