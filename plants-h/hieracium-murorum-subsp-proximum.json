It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellowish to reddish disc flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and is often found in moist or semi-shaded environments. It has a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Its foliage is usually covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture."
