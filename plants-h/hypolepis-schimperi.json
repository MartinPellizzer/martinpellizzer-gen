    "intro": "Hypolepis schimperi, commonly known as the African shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil, while its spores are dispersed by wind. Hypolepis schimperi is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
