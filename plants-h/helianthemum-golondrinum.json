    "intro": "Helianthemum golondrinum, commonly known as the blue thyme or sky-blue thyme, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, aromatic leaves that are gray-green in color and emit a subtle, mint-like fragrance. The plant produces clusters of tiny, sky-blue flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy and drought-tolerant species. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
