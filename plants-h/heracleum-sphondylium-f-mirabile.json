    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. mirabile, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a striking member of the Apiaceae family characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence and deeply lobed leaves. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to North America, where it is considered an invasive species. The plant can grow up to 5 meters tall, with white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its stems are covered in soft, hairy ridges and have a distinctive purple coloration. The leaves are large, heart-shaped, and can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, making them one of the most recognizable features of the plant."
