    "intro": "Hoya subquaterna, commonly known as the four-leaf hoya, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are often variegated with white and green patterns. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, which bloom in clusters. Hoya subquaterna is a popular houseplant due to its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
