It is native to Brazil and is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, strap-shaped leaves that are often brightly colored. The plant produces inflorescences that are typically green or red, with small, showy flowers that bloom in the spring. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements.
