    "intro": "Heterotheca oregona var. rudis, commonly known as the roughleaf fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are rough and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
