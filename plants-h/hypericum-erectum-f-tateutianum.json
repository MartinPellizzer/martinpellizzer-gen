It features upright, branching stems covered in glandular hairs, and its foliage consists of opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in terminal and axillary clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and hardiness. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller stature and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Hypericum erectum."
