    "intro": "Hedysarum schellianum, commonly known as Schell\u2019s milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellowish to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or steppe habitats. Hedysarum schellianum plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its association with rhizobial bacteria."
