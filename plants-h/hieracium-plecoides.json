    "intro": "Hieracium plecoides, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, and its leaves are covered in dense, woolly hairs. Hieracium plecoides is often considered a weed but can serve as a host plant for certain insects."
