    "intro": "Hedyotis ponapensis var. ponapensis, commonly known as the Ponap\u00e9 geranium, is a flowering plant native to the island of Ponap\u00e9 in the Federated States of Micronesia. It is a small, herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface and produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in terminal inflorescences. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited geographic range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
