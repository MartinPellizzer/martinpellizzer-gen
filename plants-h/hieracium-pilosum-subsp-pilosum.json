    "intro": "Hieracium pilosum subsp. pilosum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features erect stems covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, forming dense clusters at the top of the stem, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
