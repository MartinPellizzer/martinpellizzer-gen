    "intro": "Hieracium anchusoides subsp. sertiflorum, commonly known as the Anchusoid dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the flowers are yellow, often appearing in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, clustered flower heads and its ability to thrive in arid conditions."
