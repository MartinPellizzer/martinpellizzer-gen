    "intro": "Helichrysum gracilescens, commonly known as the slender everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellow to orange flowers that are tightly clustered in dense, spherical heads. The plant has a compact, low-growing habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its drought tolerance and ability to retain its color after drying make it a popular choice for floral arrangements."
