    "intro": "Hakea chrysophaea, commonly known as the golden hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or spire-like inflorescences that are typically bright yellow, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, actinomorphic flowers that are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Hakea chrysophaea is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
