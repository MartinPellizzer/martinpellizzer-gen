    "intro": "Hypseocharis pimpinellifolia, commonly known as the mountain pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its small, clustered white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and shrublands, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of the common pimpernel, giving it its common name. Hypseocharis pimpinellifolia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to the harsh conditions of its alpine habitat."
