It is characterized by its large, broad, waxy leaves that can grow up to 30 inches in length, often with a pale green to white variegation. The plant produces tall, slender flower stalks that bear small, fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers in late summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental foliage and is a popular choice for shade gardens."
