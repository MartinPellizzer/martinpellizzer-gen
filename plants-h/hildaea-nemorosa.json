    "intro": "Hildaea nemorosa, commonly known as the forest hildaea, is a flowering plant native to the temperate regions of the Americas. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided leaves and umbel-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hildaea nemorosa is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora in its native habitat."
