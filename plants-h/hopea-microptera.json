It belongs to the family Dipterocarpaceae and is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically clustered in catkins, followed by woody, elongated fruits containing single seeds. Its wood is valued for its durability and is used in construction and furniture-making. Hopea microptera plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, contributing to biodiversity and soil stabilization."
