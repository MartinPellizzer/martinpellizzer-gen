    "intro": "Habenaria ibarrae, commonly known as the Ibarra's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and slender, erect stem. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive three-lobed lip, which is a common feature among many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
