    "intro": "Hirnellia suffruticosa, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western Pacific islands. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
