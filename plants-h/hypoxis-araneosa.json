    "intro": "Hypoxis araneosa, commonly known as the spider lily, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a short, rhizomatous stem and produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers. The leaves are narrow, grass-like, and often arranged in a rosette pattern at the base. It thrives in well-drained soils and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
