    "intro": "Haloragis masatierrana var. masatierrana, commonly known as the Masatierra silverleaf, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of southern South America. It is characterized by its silver-gray, woolly foliage that reflects sunlight and reduces water loss. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal and saline environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping in arid regions."
