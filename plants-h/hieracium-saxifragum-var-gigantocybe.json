    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum var. gigantocybe, commonly known as the giant hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features a basal rosette of hairy, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces tall, leafless stems that bear yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped inflorescence. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its striking appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
