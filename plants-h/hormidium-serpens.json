    "intro": "Hormidium serpens, commonly known as the serpentine liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its flattened, ribbon-like leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as on rocks or in forest floors, where it can absorb moisture from the air. Hormidium serpens has a simple structure with no true roots, stems, or leaves in the traditional sense, and instead relies on rhizoids for anchoring and nutrient absorption. Its reproductive structures are microscopic and require a damp environment for successful spore dispersal."
