    "intro": "Habenaria dolichocaulon, commonly known as the slender-stemmed marsh orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant features a slender, wiry stem and produces small, greenish or yellowish flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often arranged in a rosette at the base of the stem. The orchid relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, a common trait among orchid species."
