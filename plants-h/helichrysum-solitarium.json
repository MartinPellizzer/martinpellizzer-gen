The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it a unique appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for xeriscaping. The dried flowers are used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature and vibrant color."
