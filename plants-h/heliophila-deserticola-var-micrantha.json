It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often resembling those of the heliotrope genus. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low moisture. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and resilience in challenging environments."
