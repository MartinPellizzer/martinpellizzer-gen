    "intro": "Holcus nigricans, commonly known as black bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, narrow leaves and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Holcus nigricans is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting insect life."
