It is a low-growing shrub with yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has small, leathery leaves and is adapted to dry, rocky environments. It is often found in coastal areas and sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for xerophytic conditions and it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
