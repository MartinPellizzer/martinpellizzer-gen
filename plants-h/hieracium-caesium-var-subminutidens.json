    "intro": "Hieracium caesium var. subminutidens, commonly known as the small-flowered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in some areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and it is adapted to temperate climates."
