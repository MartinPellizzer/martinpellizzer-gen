    "intro": "Hemionitis sagittata, commonly known as the arrowhead fern, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and have a distinctive arrowhead shape, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas or along the edges of ponds. Its reproductive structures include small, spore-bearing clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis sagittata is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local biodiversity."
