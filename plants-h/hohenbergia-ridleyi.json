    "intro": "Hohenbergia ridleyi, commonly known as the \"Ridley's hohenbergia,\" is a species of bromeliad native to Ecuador. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are usually dark green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically red or orange, adding visual interest to its appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia ridleyi is appreciated for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
