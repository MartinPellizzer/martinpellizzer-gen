    "intro": "Hieracium exotericum, commonly known as the exoteric hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellowish to reddish composite flowers and hairy, alternate leaves. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in moist or disturbed soils. The plant produces numerous small seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. It is considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its invasive tendencies."
