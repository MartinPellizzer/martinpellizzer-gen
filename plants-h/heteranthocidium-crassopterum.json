    "intro": "Heteranthocidium crassopterum, commonly known as the broad-winged bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its small, aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat and specialized bladder-like structures used to trap small prey. The plant has whorled leaves that are often submerged, with the upper leaves bearing the bladder traps. It is native to regions in Europe and Asia, typically found in wetlands and marshy areas. Its unique morphology and carnivorous adaptation make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
