    "intro": "Hyperbaena columbica var. excisa, commonly known as the coastal goldenbush, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal landscapes. Its leaves are often finely divided, giving it a feathery appearance, and it is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. This variety is notable for its resilience to salt spray and wind, which are common in its natural habitat."
