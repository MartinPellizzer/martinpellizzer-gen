    "intro": "Heliconia densiflora subsp. densiflora, commonly known as the dense-flowered heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that enclose its small, clustered flowers. The plant has long, sword-shaped leaves and produces inflorescences that are often used in floral arrangements due to their striking appearance. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The flowers are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, which are attracted to its nectar-rich blooms."
