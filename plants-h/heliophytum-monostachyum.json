    "intro": "Heliophytum monostachyum, commonly known as the flame flower, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features fleshy, ribbed stems and produces striking, showy flowers that range from orange to red. The plant thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it well-suited for arid environments. Its leaves are often blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Heliophytum monostachyum is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
