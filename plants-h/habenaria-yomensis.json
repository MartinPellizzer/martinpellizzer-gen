    "intro": "Habenaria yomensis, commonly known as the Yoman's orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, terrestrial growth habit. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to thrive in shaded, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
