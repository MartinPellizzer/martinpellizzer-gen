    "intro": "Heracleum micranthum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a biennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and large, umbrella-like clusters of small white flowers. The plant has broad, lobed leaves with a hairy texture and a strong, aromatic odor. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and roadside areas. Due to its toxic sap, it should be handled with care."
