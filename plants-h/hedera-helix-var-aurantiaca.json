    "intro": "Hedera helix var. aurantiaca, commonly known as the golden ivy, is a cultivar of the common ivy that exhibits striking yellow variegation on its leaves. This plant is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and is characterized by its glossy, heart-shaped foliage. The variegation is due to a mutation that reduces chlorophyll production, resulting in a vibrant yellow and green coloration. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor and outdoor gardens. While it is less hardy than other ivy varieties, it adds a decorative touch with its unique leaf patterns."
