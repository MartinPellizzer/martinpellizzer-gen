    "intro": "Heracleum lecoqii, commonly known as the Lecoq's cowparsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbel-shaped flowers. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, temperate regions, often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant features hollow, ridged stems and leaves that are deeply divided, resembling those of other parsley relatives. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in compound umbels, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. Heracleum lecoqii is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and adaptability."
