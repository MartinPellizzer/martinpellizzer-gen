    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. bructerigenum, commonly known as the bruchterigen hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in moist meadows and grasslands. It has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
