    "intro": "Hibiscus dasycalyx, commonly known as the woolly calyx hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant features thick, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its calyx, which is densely covered with soft hairs, gives it its common name. Hibiscus dasycalyx is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
