    "intro": "Henckelia nivea, commonly known as the white henckelia, is a species of flowering plant native to the Andean region of South America. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude environments, often found in cloud forests and alpine meadows. The plant is characterized by its white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in clusters and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually narrow and lance-shaped, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. Henckelia nivea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
