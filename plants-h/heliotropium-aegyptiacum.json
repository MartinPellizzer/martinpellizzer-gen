    "intro": "Heliotropium aegyptiacum, commonly known as the Egyptian heliotrope, is an annual herbaceous plant native to Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs and produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has palmate leaves with three to five lobes, and its flowers are often fragrant, emitting a scent reminiscent of vanilla or honey. It is adapted to thrive in dry, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. The plant's ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies makes it ecologically significant in its native habitats."
