    "intro": "Hornstedtia phaeochoana, commonly known as the black-veined orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and its distinctive, dark purple to black flowers with contrasting white veins. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. It has a compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant blooms during the late spring and early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
