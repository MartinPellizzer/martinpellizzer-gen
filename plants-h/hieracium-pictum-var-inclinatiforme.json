    "intro": "Hieracium pictum var. inclinatiforme, commonly known as the leaning form of the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The variant 'inclinatiforme' is distinguished by its slightly drooping or leaning growth habit compared to the standard form of H. pictum."
