    "intro": "Hoya rubida, commonly known as the red-veined hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often display striking red or pink veins against a deep green background. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Hoya rubida thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its attractive foliage and low maintenance requirements."
