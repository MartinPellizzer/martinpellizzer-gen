    "intro": "Hecubaea, commonly known as the bluebell vine, is a flowering plant belonging to the Convolvulaceae family. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is native to the southeastern United States and thrives in moist, woodland environments. Its climbing habit is facilitated by its tendrils, which help it ascend trees and shrubs. Hecubaea is also noted for its fragrant foliage and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
