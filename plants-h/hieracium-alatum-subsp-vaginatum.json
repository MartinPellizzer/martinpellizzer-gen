It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and rocky areas, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, with a distinctive lobed shape, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and the presence of leaf sheaths, which help in identifying it from related species."
