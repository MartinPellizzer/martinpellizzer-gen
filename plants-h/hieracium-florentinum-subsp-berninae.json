It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and meadow habitats at high elevations. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, herbaceous stems that bear the flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
