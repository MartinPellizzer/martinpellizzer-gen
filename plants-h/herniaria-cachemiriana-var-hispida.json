It features a mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy, rounded leaves that are densely covered in short, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
