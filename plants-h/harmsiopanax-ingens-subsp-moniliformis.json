    "intro": "Harmsiopanax ingens subsp. moniliformis, commonly known as the giant climbing palm, is a member of the Araliaceae family and is native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its massive, arched leaves and long, vine-like stems that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often climbing trees and using its aerial roots for support. Its leaves are typically large, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, which helps it thrive in humid environments. This subspecies is notable for its potential use in traditional medicine and its ecological role in supporting biodiversity in its native habitat."
