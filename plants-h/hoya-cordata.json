    "intro": "Hoya cordata, commonly known as the wax plant or sweetheart plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often heart-shaped, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink or red, depending on the variety. Hoya cordata is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and ease of care make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
