It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually red or orange in color. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by insects, and the plant produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hedyotis verticillaris is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
