It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into dry, hairy seeds. Hepetis anthericoides is often found in wetland ecosystems and is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and maintaining wetland biodiversity."
