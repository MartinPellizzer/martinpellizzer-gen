    "intro": "Haplopappus venetus subsp. oxyphyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leafed desertweed, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its narrow, linear leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The small yellow flowers bloom in the summer, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind."
