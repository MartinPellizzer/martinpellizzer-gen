    "intro": "Hymenophyllum ciliatum var. abbreviatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It features small, translucent, and often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's leaves are covered with a fine, silky layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or on tree trunks. This variety is distinguished by its shorter, more compact fronds compared to the typical form of Hymenophyllum ciliatum."
