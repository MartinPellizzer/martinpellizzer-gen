    "intro": "Hieracium atratum subsp. pseudodolichaetum, commonly known as the dark hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, pastures, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features dark green, alternate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its shorter, more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
