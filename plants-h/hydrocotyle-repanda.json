    "intro": "Hydrocotyle repanda, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features rounded, floating leaves that are typically 5-10 cm in diameter, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The plant produces small, white flowers with four petals, which bloom from June to August. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in shallow water or moist soil. Hydrocotyle repanda plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for invertebrates and stabilizing shoreline sediments."
