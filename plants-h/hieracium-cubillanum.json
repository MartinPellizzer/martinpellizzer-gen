It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and forest edges. It produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Hieracium cubillanum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native environment."
