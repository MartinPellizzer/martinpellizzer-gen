    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum var. longifolium, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing hemiparasitic plant that relies on ant symbiosis for nutrient acquisition. It produces specialized structures called domatia, which provide shelter for colonies of ants. The plant's leaves are broad and elongated, with a distinctive waxy coating that aids in water retention. It is native to tropical regions of Asia and is often found in lowland rainforests. Its unique relationship with ants makes it an important component of its ecological community."
