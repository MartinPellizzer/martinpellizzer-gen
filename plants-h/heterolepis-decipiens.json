    "intro": "Heterolepis decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive grass, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in panicles, which are typically wind-pollinated. Heterolepis decipiens thrives in moist, open habitats such as wet meadows and pond edges. Its name \"deceptive grass\" likely refers to its ability to mimic other grasses, making it difficult to identify without close examination."
