The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a unique inflorescence that bears several clustered flowers. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia dolichocentra is considered a species of conservation concern."
