    "intro": "Helleborus multifidus subsp. istriacus, commonly known as the Istrian hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It features dark green, waxy leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a distinctive purplish hue beneath. The plant produces clusters of nodding, greenish-white flowers with prominent, showy sepals rather than true petals. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is adapted to calcareous soils. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
