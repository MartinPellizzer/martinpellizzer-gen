    "intro": "Hieracium bocconei subsp. devexicola, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
