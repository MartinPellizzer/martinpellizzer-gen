    "intro": "Holostigma minutiflorum, commonly known as the small-flowered holostigma, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
