    "intro": "Haplophyllum ciscaucasicum, commonly known as the Caucasian haplophyllum, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Berberidaceae. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with succulent, fleshy leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in late spring. Native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
