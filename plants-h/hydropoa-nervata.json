It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green and slightly translucent. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. Its reproductive structures include sporangia that release spores into the water. Hydropoa nervata plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and oxygen to aquatic life."
