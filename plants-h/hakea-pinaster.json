    "intro": "Hakea pinaster, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to southwestern Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and its ability to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that appear in winter and early spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea pinaster is well adapted to poor soils and can withstand drought conditions due to its deep root system. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and resilience."
