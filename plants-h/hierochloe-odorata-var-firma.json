It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and fine, grass-like leaves that are often tinged with a reddish hue. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, greenish-brown flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as meadows and prairies. This variety is noted for its aromatic foliage and its role in supporting local pollinators."
