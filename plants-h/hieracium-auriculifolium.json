    "intro": "Hieracium auriculifolium, commonly known as the auriculate hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are distinctly shaped with auriculate (ear-shaped) lobes at the base, giving it its common name. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants and altering local ecosystems."
