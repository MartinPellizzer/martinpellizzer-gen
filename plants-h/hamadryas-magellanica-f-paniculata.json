It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a combination of white and pink hues. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often arid or semi-arid habitat. Its flowers are usually arranged in loose, branching clusters, and it thrives in well-drained soil with adequate sunlight. This orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by enthusiasts for its beauty and resilience."
