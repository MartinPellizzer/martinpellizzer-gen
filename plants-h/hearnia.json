    "intro": "Hearnia, commonly known as the silver ponytail plant, is a member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its long, trailing stems and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy, silver-gray appearance. Hearnia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
