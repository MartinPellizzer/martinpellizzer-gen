    "intro": "Hoitzia nepetifolia, commonly known as the silverleaf hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, silver-green leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, typically blooming during the warmer months. Hoitzia nepetifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its striking appearance and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
