It is a columnar cactus characterized by its ribbed stems and spines, adapted to arid environments. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that bloom at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its foliage is reduced to spines, with modified stems performing photosynthesis. The plant is valued for its ornamental beauty and ecological role in its native habitat."
