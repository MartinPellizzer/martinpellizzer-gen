    "intro": "Hieracium allothigenes, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium allothigenes is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
