    "intro": "Hieracium schmidtii subsp. subrupicola, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often on slopes or cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. Its flowers are typically arranged in a single inflorescence at the end of a single stem. The subspecies is distinguished by its compact growth habit and its ability to colonize harsh, alpine environments."
