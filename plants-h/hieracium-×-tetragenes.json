It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and rosette-forming leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across temperate regions. It is a perennial species with a fibrous root system and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
