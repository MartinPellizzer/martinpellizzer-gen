    "intro": "Helianthemum molle var. mariforme, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Europe and northern Africa. It is a low-growing shrub with silver-gray foliage and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray, making it well-suited for coastal environments. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The leaves are typically covered in fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
