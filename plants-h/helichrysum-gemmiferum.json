    "intro": "Helichrysum gemmiferum, commonly known as the golden geranium, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that are often used in dried floral arrangements due to their long-lasting color. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and a compact growth habit. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. Its scientific name reflects its gem-like appearance and the presence of gemmae, which are small vegetative propagules."
