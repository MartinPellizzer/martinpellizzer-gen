    "intro": "Hypolepis amaurorhachis, commonly known as the golden shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, shield-shaped fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its rhizomes are thick and creeping, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The fronds are bioluminescent in the dark, a unique trait that aids in attracting nocturnal pollinators."
