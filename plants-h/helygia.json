    "intro": "Helygia, commonly known as the \"moonflower,\" is a striking plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, white, fragrant flowers that open at night and close by morning, adapting to the lunar cycle. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in its arid environment. Its unique flowering pattern makes it a popular subject in botanical studies and horticulture. Helygia thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
