    "intro": "Haageocereus acranthus subsp. deflexispinus, commonly known as the Mexican candleplant, is a member of the Cactaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a small, spineless cactus that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant features a cylindrical stem with a distinctive, candle-like appearance, which is why it is often referred to as the candleplant. It produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its environment. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in arid gardens."
