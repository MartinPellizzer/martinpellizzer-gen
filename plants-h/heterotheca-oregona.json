    "intro": "Heterotheca oregona, commonly known as the Oregon hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact, daisy-like clusters, which bloom from late summer to early fall. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and it has a taproot system that helps it survive in dry conditions. Heterotheca oregona is part of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies, sunflowers, and other composite flowers."
