    "intro": "Himatanthus semilunatus, commonly known as the moon cactus, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a swollen, brightly colored \"body\" and a smaller, green \"head\" that resembles a cactus. It thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant."
