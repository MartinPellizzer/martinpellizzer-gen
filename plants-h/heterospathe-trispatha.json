    "intro": "Heterospathe trispatha, commonly known as the three-path fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that exhibit three distinct paths or divisions, giving it its scientific name. The plant has a creeping rhizome and produces fertile fronds that bear sporangia on the underside. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and can grow up to several feet in length. Heterospathe trispatha is often found in humid, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks."
