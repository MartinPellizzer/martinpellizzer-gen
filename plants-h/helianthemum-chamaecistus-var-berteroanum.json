It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has compact, evergreen foliage with silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine, woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
