    "intro": "Helianthus attenuatus, commonly known as the slender sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, open habitats. The plant features tall, slender stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow ray flowers surrounded by a disk of smaller florets. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to drought conditions. The flower heads are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological importance."
