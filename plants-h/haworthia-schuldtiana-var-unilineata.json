    "intro": "Haworthia schuldtiana var. unilineata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinct white or pale longitudinal markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white or pink flowers on tall stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect sunlight. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rockeries."
