    "intro": "Hakea mimosoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is an evergreen shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves and distinctive, cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, egg-shaped capsules containing seeds. Hakea mimosoides is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for coastal gardens. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for native landscaping."
