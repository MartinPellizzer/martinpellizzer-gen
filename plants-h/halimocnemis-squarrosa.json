    "intro": "Halimocnemis squarrosa, commonly known as the woolly sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing annual herb with a distinctive woolly appearance due to its dense, soft hairs covering the stems and leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Halimocnemis squarrosa plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small insects and animals."
