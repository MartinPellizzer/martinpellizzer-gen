    "intro": "Hydrocotyle pinnatifida, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to North America. It has floating leaves that are typically divided into narrow, thread-like segments, giving it a delicate appearance. The plant thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its small white flowers bloom in late summer, and it produces small, round fruits that float on the water's surface. Hydrocotyle pinnatifida plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
