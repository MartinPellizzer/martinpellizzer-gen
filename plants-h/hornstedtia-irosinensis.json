    "intro": "Hornstedtia irosinensis, commonly known as the Irosin horned orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its unique, horn-like structures on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in montane forest habitats, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers are small and usually greenish-white, with a subtle fragrance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat fragility, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from deforestation and habitat loss."
