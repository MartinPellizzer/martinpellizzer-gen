    "intro": "Hieracium hypoprasinum, commonly known as the green-haired hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, greenish-white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and grasslands across Europe. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
