It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium platyglossum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a resilient wildflower."
