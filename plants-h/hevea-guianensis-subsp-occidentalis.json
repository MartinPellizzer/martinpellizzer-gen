    "intro": "Hevea guianensis subsp. occidentalis, commonly known as the Western Guianese rubber tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to parts of South America, including Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The plant is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. It is a dioecious species, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants. This subspecies is notable for its potential latex-producing capabilities, though it is less commercially significant than other hevea species."
