    "intro": "Heliamphora arenicola, commonly known as the sand-pit pitcher plant, is a species of carnivorous plant native to Venezuela. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, funnel-shaped leaves that form pitfall traps to capture insects. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils, often found in sandy or rocky habitats. Its pitchers are typically greenish-yellow with red veins, and they secrete a digestive enzyme to break down prey. Heliamphora arenicola is a popular specimen among carnivorous plant enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and unique ecological adaptations."
