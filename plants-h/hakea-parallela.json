    "intro": "Hakea parallela, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical or conical inflorescences that bear small, pink or red flowers. These flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly honeyeaters. Hakea parallela is often found in sandy or gravelly soils in coastal and inland regions."
