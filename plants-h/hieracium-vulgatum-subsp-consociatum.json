    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. consociatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and its basal leaves are typically heart-shaped with serrated edges. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grassy areas and disturbed soils. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread and form dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
