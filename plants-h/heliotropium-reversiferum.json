It is characterized by its opposite leaf arrangement, which gives it its specific epithet \"reversiferum.\" The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or purple, often arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas or near water sources. The species is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal."
