    "intro": "Hieracium arkansanum, commonly known as Arkansas hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the central United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, preferring full sun. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is considered a weed in some areas due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize new sites."
