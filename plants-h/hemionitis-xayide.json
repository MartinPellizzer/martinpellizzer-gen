    "intro": "Hemionitis xayide, commonly known as the Xayide's hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of other hemionitids. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical rainforests or mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing soruses, are typically located on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis xayide is considered a species of conservation concern."
