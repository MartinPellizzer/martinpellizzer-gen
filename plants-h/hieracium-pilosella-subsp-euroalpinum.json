    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. euroalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with bright yellow flowers. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils at high altitudes, often in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within its ecological niche."
