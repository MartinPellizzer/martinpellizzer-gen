    "intro": "Hevea membranacea f. leiogyne, commonly known as the smooth-leaved rubber tree, is a variant of the rubber tree species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically narrower and more elongated compared to the standard species. The plant is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree with a dense canopy and can grow up to 15 meters in height under optimal conditions. Its latex, similar to that of Hevea brasiliensis, has been historically used for rubber production. However, it is less commercially significant due to lower latex yield and specific environmental requirements."
