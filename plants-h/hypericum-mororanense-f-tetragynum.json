    "intro": "Hypericum mororanense f. tetragynum, commonly known as the four-stamen St. John's wort, is a rare and unique variant of the St. John's wort genus. It is characterized by its distinctive floral morphology, featuring four stamens instead of the typical six found in most Hypericum species. This form is native to specific regions in Central America, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
