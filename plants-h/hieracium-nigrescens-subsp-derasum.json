It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers with dark centers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
