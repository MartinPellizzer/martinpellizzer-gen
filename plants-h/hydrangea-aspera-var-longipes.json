    "intro": "Hydrangea aspera var. longipes, commonly known as the long-peduncled rough hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and large, showy inflorescences composed of sterile flowers. The plant produces blue or pink flower clusters that change color based on soil pH, a trait influenced by its high aluminum content. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and natural landscapes."
