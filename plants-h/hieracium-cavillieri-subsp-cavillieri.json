    "intro": "Hieracium cavillieri subsp. cavillieri, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, reaching heights of up to 40 centimeters. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish to orange-red flowers. It produces achenes (small, dry fruits) with pappus hairs, which aid in wind dispersal. This species is often found in open habitats and is characteristic of the Asteraceae family."
