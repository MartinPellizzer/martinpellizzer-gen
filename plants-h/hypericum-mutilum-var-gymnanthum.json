    "intro": "Hypericum mutilum var. gymnanthum, commonly known as the narrow-fruit St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features slender, woody stems and lance-shaped leaves with a glossy green surface. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures that mature in the fall, containing numerous seeds. This variety is characterized by its reduced floral structures compared to other Hypericum species, making it distinct in morphology."
