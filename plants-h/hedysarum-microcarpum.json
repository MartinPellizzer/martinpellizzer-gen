    "intro": "Hedysarum microcarpum, commonly known as the small-fruited milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hedysarum microcarpum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh alpine environments. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
