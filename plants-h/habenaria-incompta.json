    "intro": "Habenaria incompta, commonly known as the slender orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, hairy texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green or white, with three sepals and three petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture, though it requires specific care to maintain its natural growth conditions."
