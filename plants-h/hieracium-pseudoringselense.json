It is native to Central and Eastern Europe and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, dark seeds that are dispersed by wind.
