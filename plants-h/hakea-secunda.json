    "intro": "Hakea secunda, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and produces cylindrical, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to arid environments, featuring a deep root system and reduced leaf surface to minimize water loss. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and its growth habit makes it suitable for use in dry gardens. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
