    "intro": "Helianthus fascicularis, commonly known as the slender sunflower, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous annual plant that typically grows in moist, open habitats such as wetlands and prairies. The plant features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Helianthus fascicularis plays an important role in supporting local ecosystems and is often found in restoration projects."
