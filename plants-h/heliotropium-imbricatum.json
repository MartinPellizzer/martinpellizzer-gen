    "intro": "Heliotropium imbricatum, commonly known as the beach heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple, often resembling those of the common heliotrope. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune ecosystems. Its leaves are typically opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Heliotropium imbricatum is also known for its ability to stabilize sand dunes, making it an ecologically important species in coastal areas."
