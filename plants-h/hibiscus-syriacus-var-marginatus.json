    "intro": "Hibiscus syriacus var. marginatus, commonly known as the white-veined rose of Sharon, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range from white to pale pink, with distinctive white veins on the petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are dark green in color. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
