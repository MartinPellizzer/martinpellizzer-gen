    "intro": "Heliocarpus oblongifolius, commonly known as the Brazilian burr or Brazilian chestnut, is a tropical tree native to South America. It is characterized by its rough, ridged bark and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces woody, spiny fruits that contain one or two seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Its growth habit includes a short trunk and a dense, spreading crown, making it a notable feature in its native habitat. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
