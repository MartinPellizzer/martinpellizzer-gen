    "intro": "Hieracium fulgens, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant produces bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers. Hieracium fulgens typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Its hairy stems and leaves help it retain moisture in dry environments."
