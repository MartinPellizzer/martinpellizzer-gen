    "intro": "Hieracium praeustum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium praeustum is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
