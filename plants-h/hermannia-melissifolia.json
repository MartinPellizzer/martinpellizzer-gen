    "intro": "Hermannia melissifolia, commonly known as the honey-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a mildly sour taste, making it a useful plant in traditional cuisine. Hermannia melissifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
