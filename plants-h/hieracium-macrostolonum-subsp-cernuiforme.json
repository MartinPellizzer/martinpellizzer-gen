    "intro": "Hieracium macrostolonum subsp. cernuiforme, commonly known as the bent-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping growth habit with stolons that help it spread across the ground. The plant has basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, and its flowering stems bear yellow, daisy-like flowers. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its drooping, umbrella-shaped inflorescence and hairy stems."
