It typically grows to a height of 2 to 6 feet, featuring arching branches and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces red or orange berries that are edible for birds but generally not recommended for human consumption. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Hypechusa hybrida is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
