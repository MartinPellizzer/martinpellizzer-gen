    "intro": "Hoya davaoensis, commonly known as the Davao waxplant, is a tropical flowering plant native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with white and green markings. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya davaoensis is noted for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces."
