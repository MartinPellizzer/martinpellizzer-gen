    "intro": "Haworthia aspera var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers on tall, slender stalks during the growing season. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
