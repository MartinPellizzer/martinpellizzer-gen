    "intro": "Hieracium macilentum subsp. exilentum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, followed by seeds dispersed by wind. The subspecies exilentum is distinguished by its slender stems and reduced leaf structure compared to other members of the species."
