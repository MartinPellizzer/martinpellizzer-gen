    "intro": "Hirnellia, commonly known as the \"Cape honeysuckle,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, and includes several species that are often found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plants are characterized by their showy, tubular flowers that come in shades of yellow, orange, and red, attracting birds and insects for pollination. Hirnellia species typically have opposite, simple leaves and produce small, capsule-like fruits. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
