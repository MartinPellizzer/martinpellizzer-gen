    "intro": "Hieracium adeniscotum, commonly known as the sticky hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features dark green, hairy leaves and produces small yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium adeniscotum is known for its sticky, glandular hairs on both the leaves and stems, which can trap insects. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides."
