    "intro": "Hieracium intersitum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and stems that bear yellow flowers arranged in a cluster. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. It produces seeds that are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread across various environments. Hieracium intersitum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
