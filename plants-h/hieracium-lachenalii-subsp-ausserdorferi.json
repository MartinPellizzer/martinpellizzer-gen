It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has small, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
