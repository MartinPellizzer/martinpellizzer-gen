It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that give it a sticky texture, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Hesperolinon adenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
