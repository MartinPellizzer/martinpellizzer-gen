    "intro": "Heterachaena, commonly known as the narrow-leafed grass, is a genus of flowering plants in the grass family, Poaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The plants typically have slender, grass-like leaves and produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Heterachaena species are often found in wetland or marshy habitats, where they thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine and are also studied for their ecological roles in wetland ecosystems."
