    "intro": "Hydrocotyle acuminata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water arum, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It features heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels, followed by red or orange berries. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread through underground stems, making it an effective colonizer of moist soils. Hydrocotyle acuminata is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams."
