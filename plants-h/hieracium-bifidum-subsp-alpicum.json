    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. alpicum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it tolerates cold and harsh environmental conditions. The plant has basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its hairy stems and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of alpine ecosystems."
