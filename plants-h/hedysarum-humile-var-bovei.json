    "intro": "Hedysarum humile var. bovei, commonly known as the Bove's milkvetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers in late spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia, making it valuable for soil enrichment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and restoration projects."
