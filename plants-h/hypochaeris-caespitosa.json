    "intro": "Hypochaeris caespitosa, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. The plant has a fibrous root system and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It is characterized by its ability to form dense clusters, which can make it invasive in certain regions. Hypochaeris caespitosa is also known for its medicinal properties, with some traditional uses in herbal remedies."
