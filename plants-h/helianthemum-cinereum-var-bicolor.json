    "intro": "Helianthemum cinereum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive two-toned appearance. The plant has silver-gray foliage covered in fine hairs, which helps it conserve moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. This hardy species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
