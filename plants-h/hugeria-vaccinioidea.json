    "intro": "Hugeria vaccinioidea, commonly known as the silver hair grass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny florets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Hugeria vaccinioidea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
