    "intro": "Hedera quinquefolia, commonly known as the five-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that typically have five lobes, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in shaded environments and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Hedera quinquefolia is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ease of cultivation."
