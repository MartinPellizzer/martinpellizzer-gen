    "intro": "Hevea glabrescens, commonly known as the white rubber tree, is a species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by capsules that contain the latex-rich seeds. Hevea glabrescens is primarily cultivated for its latex, which is used in the production of natural rubber. Due to its economic importance, it is often found in tropical plantations and requires a warm, humid climate to thrive."
