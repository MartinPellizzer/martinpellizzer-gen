These plants are characterized by their simple, opposite leaves and often bear small, inconspicuous flowers. The fruits are typically drupes, containing a single seed, and the plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine. Hymenolophus species are often found in disturbed habitats, such as along roadsides or in open woodlands. Their ecological importance includes providing food for various insects and birds."
