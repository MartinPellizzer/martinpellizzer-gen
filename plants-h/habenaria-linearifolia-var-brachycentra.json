    "intro": "Habenaria linearifolia var. brachycentra, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland and swampy habitats in Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in a spike, which are often subtended by leaf-like bracts. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in association with other wetland flora. Due to habitat loss, this species is considered vulnerable in some regions."
