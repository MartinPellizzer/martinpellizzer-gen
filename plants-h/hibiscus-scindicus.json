    "intro": "Hibiscus scindicus, commonly known as the African rose or desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thick, succulent stems adapted to store water. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Hibiscus scindicus is well-suited to hot, dry climates and is often used in traditional medicine and ornamental gardening."
