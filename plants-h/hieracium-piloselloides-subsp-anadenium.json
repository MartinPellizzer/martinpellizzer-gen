    "intro": "Hieracium piloselloides subsp. anadenium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense, flat-topped clusters. Its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn, and it is often found in disturbed or open habitats. The species is characterized by its distinctive pubescent foliage and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
