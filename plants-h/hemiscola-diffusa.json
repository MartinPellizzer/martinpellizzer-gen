    "intro": "Hemiscola diffusa, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are broad and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh climates. Hemiscola diffusa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
