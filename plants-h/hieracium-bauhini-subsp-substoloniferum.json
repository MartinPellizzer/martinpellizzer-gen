It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its stoloniferous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively through runners. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its botanical features make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
