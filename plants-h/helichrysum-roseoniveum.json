    "intro": "Helichrysum roseoniveum, commonly known as the rose-white everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers that are often mistaken for daisies. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is a hardy perennial that thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. Its long-lasting flowers make it a popular choice for dried floral arrangements."
