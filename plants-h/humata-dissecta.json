    "intro": "Humata dissecta, commonly known as the dissected fern, is a species native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are finely divided, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The leaves are often a deep green and can reach lengths of up to 1 meter, making it a striking addition to tropical gardens."
