    "intro": "Hydrocotyle saniculifolia, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with hairy, heart-shaped leaves that often form a dense mat on the ground. The plant produces small, white, umbellate flowers in the summer, which are followed by dark, spherical berries. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical characteristics make it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
