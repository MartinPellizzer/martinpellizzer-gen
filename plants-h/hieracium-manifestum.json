    "intro": "Hieracium manifestum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium manifestum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common sight in many temperate regions."
