    "intro": "Hieracium psilozaleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread prolifically."
