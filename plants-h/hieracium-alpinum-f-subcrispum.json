    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum f. subcrispum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often finely toothed. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. Its subspecies, subcrispum, is distinguished by its more sharply serrated leaf margins compared to other forms. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments."
