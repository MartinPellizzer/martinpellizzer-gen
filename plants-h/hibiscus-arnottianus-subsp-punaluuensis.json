It is characterized by its striking, large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink and red. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in coastal areas and rainforests. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
