    "intro": "Hieracium spurcifrons, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, often reddish stems. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native plants in certain regions."
