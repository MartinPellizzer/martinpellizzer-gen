    "intro": "Hesperis tilingii, commonly known as the Turkish bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and stems that rise above the foliage to support the flowering spikes. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile choice for rock gardens and borders. Hesperis tilingii is also noted for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
