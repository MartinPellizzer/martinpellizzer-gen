    "intro": "Hesperocodon hederaceus, commonly known as the ivy-like dodder, is a parasitic flowering plant that lacks chlorophyll and relies on host plants for nutrients. It belongs to the family Convolvulaceae and produces small, inconspicuous white or yellow flowers. The plant has slender, thread-like stems that twine around its hosts, often forming dense mats. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it can thrive in a variety of environments where suitable hosts are present. Due to its parasitic nature, it can be a concern for agricultural and horticultural crops."
