    "intro": "Hedysarum obscurum, commonly known as black locust or sweet caragana, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow pea-like flowers in early spring, followed by small, legume-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, open habitats such as woodlands and grasslands. Hedysarum obscurum is also valued for its hard, heavy wood and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
