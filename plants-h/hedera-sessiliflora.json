    "intro": "Hedera sessiliflora, commonly known as the broadleaf ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the Araliaceae family. It is native to the Mediterranean region and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are broad and often have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera sessiliflora is typically grown as a climbing plant, often used in ornamental landscaping for its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. It prefers well-drained soil and moderate to high humidity, making it suitable for indoor cultivation as well."
