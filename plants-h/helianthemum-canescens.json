    "intro": "Helianthemum canescens, commonly known as the silver thyme or woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has silvery-gray foliage due to a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
