    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. subacuminatum, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features a robust stem with spiny leaves that are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender stem and narrower leaves compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
