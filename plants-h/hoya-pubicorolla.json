    "intro": "Hoya pubicorolla, commonly known as the coral hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, elliptical leaves that are often dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Hoya pubicorolla is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to climb or trail when provided with support."
