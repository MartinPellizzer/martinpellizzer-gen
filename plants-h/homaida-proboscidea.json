It is characterized by its intricate, pendulous inflorescence and striking, fragrant flowers that resemble the shape of a proboscis, hence its scientific name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific soil conditions to flourish. Its botanical significance lies in its unusual morphology and limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for protective measures."
