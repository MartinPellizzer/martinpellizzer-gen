    "intro": "Hemionitis lanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionitis, is a small, perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand periods of drought. Hemionitis lanceolata is considered a rare and endangered species, with limited geographic distribution and specific habitat requirements."
