    "intro": "Hydrocotyle petiolaris, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant has floating leaves with a waxy cuticle that helps it remain buoyant and reduce water loss. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in the summer and are followed by small, round fruits. Hydrocotyle petiolaris plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
