    "intro": "Hypolepis \u00d7 paulistana, commonly known as the hybrid bird's nest fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hypolepis scolopendria and Hypolepis zeylanica. It is a tropical fern characterized by its large, intricate, and often umbrella-like fronds that resemble a bird's nest. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and have a velvety texture, with a distinctive pattern of stipes and rachises. Hypolepis \u00d7 paulistana is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appearance and ability to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
