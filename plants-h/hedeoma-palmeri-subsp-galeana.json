    "intro": "Hedeoma palmeri subsp. galeana, commonly known as the Mexican blueweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its blue to violet flowers and hairy, aromatic leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid environments. Its subspecies status reflects genetic differences from the broader Hedeoma palmeri species, particularly in floral morphology and geographic distribution. Hedeoma palmeri subsp. galeana is often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats."
