    "intro": "Hydrocotyle americana var. flexicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water pennywort, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along stream edges. The plant features small, rounded leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a dense network of veins. Its stems are slender and often branched, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and stabilizing sediments."
