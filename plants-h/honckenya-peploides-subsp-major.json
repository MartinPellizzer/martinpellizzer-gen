    "intro": "Honckenya peploides subsp. major, commonly known as the desert sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial that thrives in sandy soils and extreme desert conditions. The plant has small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing sand dunes and preventing soil erosion. Due to its specialized adaptations, it is considered a keystone species in its native habitat."
