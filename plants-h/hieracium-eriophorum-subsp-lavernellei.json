    "intro": "Hieracium eriophorum subsp. lavernellei, commonly known as the Lavernelle's Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller flower heads and shorter peduncles compared to other members of the species. It thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized plant within its range."
