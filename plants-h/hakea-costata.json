    "intro": "Hakea costata, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea costata is adapted to coastal environments, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
