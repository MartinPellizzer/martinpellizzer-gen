    "intro": "Hordeum boreale, commonly known as the Arctic or alpine barley, is a grass species native to cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in alpine tundra and arctic environments, where it thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Hordeum boreale has narrow leaves with a bluish-green hue and produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting arctic and alpine ecosystems."
