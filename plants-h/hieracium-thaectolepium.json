    "intro": "Hieracium thaectolepium, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, helping to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. Hieracium thaectolepium is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ability to spread through rhizomes."
