    "intro": "Haemadictyon glandulosum, commonly known as the sticky nettle, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Urticaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems covered in fine, glandular hairs that produce a sticky substance. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its leaves are typically alternate with serrated edges. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is often found in moist, shaded environments. The sticky hairs on its stems and leaves serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
