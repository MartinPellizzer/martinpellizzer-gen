    "intro": "Hibiscus jatrophifolius, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its robust, woody stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has heart-shaped, rough-textured leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Its flowers bloom in summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Hibiscus jatrophifolius is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
