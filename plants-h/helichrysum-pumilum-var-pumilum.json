    "intro": "Helichrysum pumilum var. pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf golden aster, is a low-growing perennial herb native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that resemble daisies, which are borne in dense clusters. The plant has wiry, hairy stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its drought tolerance and long-lasting blooms make it a valuable addition to native plant collections."
