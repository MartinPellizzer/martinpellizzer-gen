    "intro": "Hemipilia puberula, commonly known as the hairy hemipilia, is a herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pale green to yellow in color, with a distinct lip-like structure. Hemipilia puberula thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its unique floral morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical research."
