    "intro": "Helictotrichon humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
