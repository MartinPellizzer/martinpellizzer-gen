    "intro": "Hymenolepis leptocephala, commonly known as the slender-headed tapeworm, is a parasitic flatworm belonging to the family Hymenolepididae. It primarily infects rodents, with the mouse being its principal host, and it can also be found in other small mammals. The adult worm is typically 10\u201320 cm long and has a segmented body covered in small, rounded proglottids. Its life cycle involves both definitive and intermediate hosts, with the larvae developing within the intermediate host before being transmitted to the definitive host. The plant-like appearance of its proglottids and the structure of its reproductive organs are key features in its identification."
