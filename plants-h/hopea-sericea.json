It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Hopea sericea is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in construction and furniture-making. It also plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
