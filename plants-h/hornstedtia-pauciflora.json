    "intro": "Hornstedtia pauciflora, commonly known as the few-flowered hornstedtia, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescences. It is a perennial herb native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it grows in rocky or sandy soils. The plant has slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Hornstedtia pauciflora is adapted to full sun and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
