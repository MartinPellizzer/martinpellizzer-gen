It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, awned florets. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as sagebrush steppe and rocky slopes. Its botanical features make it an important component of arid ecosystem vegetation."
