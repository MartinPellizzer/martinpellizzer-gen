    "intro": "Haumaniastrum suberosum, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody, branched stems and small, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant has a thick, fleshy root system that allows it to survive in arid environments. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Haumaniastrum suberosum plays a role in supporting local pollinators, particularly bees and butterflies."
