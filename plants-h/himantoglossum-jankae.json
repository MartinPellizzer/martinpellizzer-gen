    "intro": "Himantoglossum jankae, commonly known as the Janka's orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a spurred lip and a complex arrangement of petals and sepals. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in limestone-rich soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, fragrant blooms. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
