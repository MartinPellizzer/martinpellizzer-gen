    "intro": "Haemanthus robustus, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking succulent plant native to South Africa. It features showy, torch-like inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, yellow, and even white, depending on the variety. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that are often blue-green in color, adapted to store water in arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers appear in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds."
