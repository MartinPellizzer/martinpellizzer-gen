    "intro": "Hesperozygis marifolia, commonly known as the desert lily, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along streambanks. The plant produces striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hesperozygis marifolia is adapted to survive in harsh conditions, making it an important component of desert ecosystems."
