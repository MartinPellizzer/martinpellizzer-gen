    "intro": "Hibiscus asperatus, commonly known as the rough hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features hairy, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, typically blooming from summer to fall. Hibiscus asperatus thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural habitats."
