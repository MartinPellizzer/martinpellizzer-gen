    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. microspilon, commonly known as the small-spored mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish composite flowers arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
