    "intro": "Hydnora johannis var. quinquefida, commonly known as the quinquefida hydnora, is a parasitic plant belonging to the Hydnoraceae family. It lacks chlorophyll and is entirely dependent on its host for nutrients, typically growing on the roots of woody plants. The plant is characterized by its fleshy, reddish stems and its unique, odorless, and often fleshy flowers that emit a strong, unpleasant smell to attract pollinators. It is found in arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa, where it thrives in dry, sandy soils. Due to its specialized lifestyle and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
