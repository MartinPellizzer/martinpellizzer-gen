    "intro": "Hippeastrum miniatum, commonly known as the miniature amaryllis, is a tropical plant native to South America. It is characterized by its compact size and vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears the flowers, which bloom in late spring or early summer. Its foliage consists of broad, strap-like leaves that emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Hippeastrum miniatum is often cultivated as a decorative plant due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
