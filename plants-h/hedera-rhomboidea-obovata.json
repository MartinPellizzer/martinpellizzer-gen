    "intro": "Hedera rhomboidea obovata, commonly known as the broad-leaf ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are broad and obovate in shape, with a deep green color. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it a popular choice for covering walls and trellises."
