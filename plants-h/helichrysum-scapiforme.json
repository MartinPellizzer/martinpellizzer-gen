    "intro": "Helichrysum scapiforme, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, bright yellow flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which are actually composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant produces narrow, grass-like leaves and has a compact, bushy growth habit. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. The flowers are long-lasting when dried, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements."
