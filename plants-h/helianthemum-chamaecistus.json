    "intro": "Helianthemum chamaecistus, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with dense, evergreen foliage and produces showy yellow or orange flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it well-suited for rocky or arid environments. Its small, leathery leaves are adapted to reduce water loss, a feature common in xerophytic plants. The flowers are typically borne in clusters and bloom in late spring to early summer."
