    "intro": "Humboltia revoluta, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and leathery, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are followed by elongated, woody pods containing several seeds. Humboltia revoluta is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a protected species in many areas."
