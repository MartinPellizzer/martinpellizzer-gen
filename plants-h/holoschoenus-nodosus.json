    "intro": "Holoschoenus nodosus, commonly known as the nodding sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its upright, grass-like leaves and distinctive, nodding inflorescences that bear small, spike-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy habitats, thriving in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense vegetation, which helps stabilize soil and support local biodiversity. Holoschoenus nodosus plays an important ecological role in its native environment, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
