It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, often hairy stems. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, showcasing adaptations to drought and poor soil conditions. Its small, yellow flowers are surrounded by a pappus, a structure that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus gilmanii is often found in rocky or sandy soils, contributing to the ecological diversity of its native habitats."
