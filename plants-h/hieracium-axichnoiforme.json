    "intro": "Hieracium axichnoiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and daisy-like composite flowers, which consist of yellow disk florets surrounded by white to pale yellow ray florets. The plant typically has narrow, linear leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
