    "intro": "Hadrolaelia sincorana, commonly known as the Sincorana orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces delicate, pendulous flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
