    "intro": "Hieracium pervagum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open areas such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its aggressive spreading habit. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and often hairy. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
