    "intro": "Hieracium coronopus, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, basal rosette of leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, waste areas, and along roadsides. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
