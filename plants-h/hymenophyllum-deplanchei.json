    "intro": "Hymenophyllum deplanchei, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, soft, and velvety fronds, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are densely packed with small, scale-like structures that help retain moisture. The reproductive structures, or sporangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species."
