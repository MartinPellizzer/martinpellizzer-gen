    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. pseudojuranum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky soils and slopes. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in harsh environments. This subspecies is part of the dandelion family (Asteraceae) and is known for its ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
