    "intro": "Histiopteris montana, commonly known as the mountain holly fern, is a species of fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rock surfaces or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually bright green and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Histiopteris montana is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
