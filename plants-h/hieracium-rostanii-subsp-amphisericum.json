    "intro": "Hieracium rostanii subsp. amphisericum, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically thrives in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. It produces small, herbaceous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowering period usually occurs in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
