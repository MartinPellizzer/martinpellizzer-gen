    "intro": "Hornungia bulbifera, commonly known as the bulbous hornungia, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. Its most distinctive feature is its ability to form bulb-like structures, which serve as storage organs for nutrients. Hornungia bulbifera is adapted to harsh, cold environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
