    "intro": "Hypochaeris bartholdii, commonly known as the common weed or yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow, daisy-like flowers and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. It has a basal rosette of leaves and produces numerous small, yellow ray florets. Hypochaeris bartholdii is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
