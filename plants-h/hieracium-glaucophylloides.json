    "intro": "Hieracium glaucophylloides, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, glaucous (bluish-gray) leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically yellow and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium glaucophylloides is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
