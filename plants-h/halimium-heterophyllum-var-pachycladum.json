    "intro": "Halimium heterophyllum var. pachycladum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink or red flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
