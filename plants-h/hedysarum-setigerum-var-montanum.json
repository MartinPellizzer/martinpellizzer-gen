    "intro": "Hedysarum setigerum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from pink to white. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, elongated seed pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, it plays a role in soil enrichment in its native habitats."
