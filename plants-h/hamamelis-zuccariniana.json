It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that turn yellow in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its bark is smooth and grayish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Hamamelis zuccariniana is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
