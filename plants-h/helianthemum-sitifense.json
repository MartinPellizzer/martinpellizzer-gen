It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of 10\u201330 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers during the summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are small, fleshy, and covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum sitifense is often found growing on rocky slopes and in sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments."
