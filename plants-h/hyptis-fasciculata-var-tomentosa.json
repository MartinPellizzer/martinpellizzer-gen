It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green foliage, which gives it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open fields. Its aromatic leaves and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping and herbal use."
