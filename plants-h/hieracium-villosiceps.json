    "intro": "Hieracium villosiceps, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
