    "intro": "Hieracium divergens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, pastures, and roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. It has a creeping rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread readily and form dense colonies. Hieracium divergens is an annual or biennial plant, often found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia."
