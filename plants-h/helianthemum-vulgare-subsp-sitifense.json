    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare subsp. sitifense, commonly known as the coastal sandwort, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It thrives in sandy and rocky coastal environments, demonstrating a high tolerance for salt and wind. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically succulent, allowing it to conserve water in arid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ability to stabilize sandy soils."
