    "intro": "Hypericum racemosum, commonly known as the common St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in summer, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has opposite, oval leaves and produces small, red-orange berries that are toxic to livestock. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky areas. Hypericum racemosum is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable plant in ecological restoration projects."
