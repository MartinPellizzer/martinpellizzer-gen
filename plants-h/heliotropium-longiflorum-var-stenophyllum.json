    "intro": "Heliotropium longiflorum var. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or purple. The leaves are narrow and elongated, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for coastal gardens. This variety is noted for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
