It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountain meadows and rocky soils. Its hairy stems and basal leaves help it withstand harsh climatic conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is a food source for certain pollinators."
