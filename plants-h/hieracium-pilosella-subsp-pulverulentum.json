    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. pulverulentum, commonly known as the dusty hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish to reddish-orange flowers. The leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often colonizing roadsides and meadows. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
