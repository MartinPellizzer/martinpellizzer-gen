It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus, particularly in Georgia and Turkey. It thrives in rocky and grassy habitats at moderate elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
