    "intro": "Hieracium bithynicum, commonly known as the Bithynian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is known for its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. Hieracium bithynicum has serrated leaves and produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth habit."
