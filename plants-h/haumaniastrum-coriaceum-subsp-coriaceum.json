    "intro": "Haumaniastrum coriaceum subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to harsh desert environments. Its fibrous roots help it store water, allowing it to survive in low-rainfall conditions. The species is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
