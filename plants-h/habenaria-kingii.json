    "intro": "Habenaria kingii, commonly known as King's marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It typically grows in wet or damp habitats such as swamps and wetlands. The plant has a slender, upright stem with a few leaves, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. Its roots are often covered in a dense, white mycorrhizal sheath, which is a characteristic feature of many orchids. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, relying heavily on symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake."
