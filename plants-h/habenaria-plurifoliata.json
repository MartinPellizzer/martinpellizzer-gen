    "intro": "Habenaria plurifoliata, commonly known as the many-leaved orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces multiple leaves that are typically lanceolate or ovate in shape. The plant blooms with small, fragrant flowers that are often pale green or yellow, arranged in a racemose inflorescence. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts for its unique foliage and delicate floral display."
