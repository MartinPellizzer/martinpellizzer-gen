It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. It produces small yellow flowers in the summer, followed by seed heads that disperse easily. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
