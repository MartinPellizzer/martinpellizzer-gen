    "intro": "Hechtia espejoana, commonly known as the Espejoan hechtia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Bromeliaceae. It is native to Mexico, specifically the state of Oaxaca, where it grows in cloud forests at elevations around 1,500 to 2,000 meters. The plant is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a central cup, which collects rainwater. Its flowers are typically orange or red, emerging from the center of the rosette, and are clustered in a spike. Hechtia espejoana is adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in crevices."
