    "intro": "Hedysarum tortuosum, commonly known as the twisted vetch, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. Hedysarum tortuosum is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
