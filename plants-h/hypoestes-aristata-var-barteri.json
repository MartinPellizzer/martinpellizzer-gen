    "intro": "Hypoestes aristata var. barteri, commonly known as the \"Snowflake\" or \"Barter's Hypoestes,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, bi-colored leaves that often feature a white or cream margin with a green center. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage, which remains attractive even when not in bloom."
