It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium prasinellum is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain pollinators."
