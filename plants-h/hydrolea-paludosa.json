    "intro": "Hydrolea paludosa, commonly known as the swamp hydrolea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in South America. It typically grows in marshy areas and along the edges of freshwater bodies, thriving in moist to waterlogged soils. The plant features slender, often prostrate stems that bear small, lance-shaped leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom during the warmer months. Hydrolea paludosa plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various small aquatic organisms."
