    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. ciliatum, commonly known as the hairy stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, basal leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking hardy, ornamental plants."
