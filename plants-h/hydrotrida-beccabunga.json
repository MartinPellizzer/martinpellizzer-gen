    "intro": "Hydrotrida beccabunga, commonly known as the water clover, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, delicate leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern, giving it a clover-like appearance. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Hydrotrida beccabunga is often used in water gardens and can help improve water quality by absorbing nutrients."
