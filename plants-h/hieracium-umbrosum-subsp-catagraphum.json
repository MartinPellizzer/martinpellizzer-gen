    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. catagraphum, commonly known as the shadow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a robust root system that helps it thrive in nutrient-poor soils. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, including variations in leaf shape and flower structure."
