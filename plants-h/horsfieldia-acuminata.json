It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has long, slender stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique morphology and ornamental value make it a popular choice for botanical gardens and specialized horticulture."
