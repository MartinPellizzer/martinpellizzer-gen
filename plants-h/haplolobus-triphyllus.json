    "intro": "Haplolobus triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leafed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to freshwater habitats in southern Africa. It is characterized by its small, floating leaves that are often covered in sticky glands, which help trap small aquatic organisms. The plant's roots are specialized for absorbing nutrients from the water, while its leaves function as traps to supplement its nutrient intake. It typically grows in still or slow-moving waters, where it can effectively capture prey. The species is notable for its unique morphology and ecological role in nutrient-poor aquatic environments."
