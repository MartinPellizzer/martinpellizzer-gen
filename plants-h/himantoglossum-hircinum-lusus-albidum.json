    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum lusus albidum, commonly known as the white hircinum orchid, is a rare and specialized orchid species native to specific regions in Europe. It is characterized by its pale or white flowers, which are typically smaller and more delicate compared to other members of the genus. The plant grows in moist, calcareous habitats such as grasslands and woodlands, often in areas with limited sunlight. It has a complex flowering structure with a distinctive lip that plays a role in pollination. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, this orchid is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
