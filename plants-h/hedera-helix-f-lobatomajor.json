    "intro": "Hedera helix f. lobatomajor, commonly known as the giant ivy, is a cultivar of the common ivy characterized by its large, lobed leaves. This variant exhibits a more vigorous growth habit compared to standard Hedera helix, often reaching greater heights and spreading more extensively. The leaves are typically broader and more deeply lobed, giving the plant a distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for climbing structures and can thrive in a variety of light conditions, though it prefers partial shade. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
