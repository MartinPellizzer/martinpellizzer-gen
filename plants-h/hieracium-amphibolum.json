It typically grows in moist environments such as wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a waxy coating. Its flowers are yellow and form a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium amphibolum is often found in areas with high humidity and can tolerate waterlogged soil."
