    "intro": "Helictochloa planiculmis subsp. angustior, commonly known as narrowleaf desert grass, is a perennial grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is drought-tolerant and often found in desert scrub and grassland habitats. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration in degraded landscapes."
