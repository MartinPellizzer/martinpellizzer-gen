    "intro": "Hieracium pseudocerinthe subsp. scapiflorum, commonly known as the scapiflorous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its elongated flower stalks, which elevate the flower heads above the foliage. Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. Its leaves are typically basal, with a rough, hairy texture, and the plant is often found in temperate climates."
