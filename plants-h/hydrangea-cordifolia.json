    "intro": "Hydrangea cordifolia, commonly known as the heartleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range from blue to pink depending on soil pH. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white fuzzy layer. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to change flower color, adding visual interest throughout the growing season."
