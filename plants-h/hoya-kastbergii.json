    "intro": "Hoya kastbergii, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, dark green leaves with a distinctive coral-red edge. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, waxy white flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Hoya kastbergii thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
