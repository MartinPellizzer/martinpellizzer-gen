    "intro": "Hedera minor, commonly known as the Persian ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to regions of southern and eastern Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera minor thrives in shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to cover walls or trellises. Its adaptability to various soil types makes it a popular choice for both indoor and outdoor gardening."
