It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow, dandelion-like flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. It has hairy stems and leaves that are usually covered with fine, white pubescence. The subspecies koehleri is distinguished by its smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to other subspecies of Hieracium murorum."
