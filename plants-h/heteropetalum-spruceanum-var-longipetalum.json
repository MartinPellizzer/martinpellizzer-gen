    "intro": "Heteropetalum spruceanum var. longipetalum, commonly known as the long-petaled mountain-ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its showy, white to pinkish flowers that appear in clusters, typically in late spring. The leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin, turning reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible for birds but not for humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and mountainous regions."
