    "intro": "Haloragis spicata, commonly known as spikeless waterwheel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It typically grows in wetland environments such as swamps, marshes, and the margins of lakes and rivers. The plant features slender, upright stems that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. Its leaves are alternate, linear to lanceolate, and usually have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in spikes and are adapted for pollination by wind or insects."
