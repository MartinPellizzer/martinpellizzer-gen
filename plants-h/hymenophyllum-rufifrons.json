    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rufifrons, commonly known as the red-fronded shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often reddish-brown fronds that are covered with a dense layer of tiny, hair-like structures called trichomes. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks in rainforests. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and produce spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum rufifrons is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
