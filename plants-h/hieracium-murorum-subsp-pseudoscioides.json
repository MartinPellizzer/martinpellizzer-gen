    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudoscioides, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
