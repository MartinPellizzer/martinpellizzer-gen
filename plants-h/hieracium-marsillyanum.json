    "intro": "Hieracium marsillyanum, commonly known as Marsilly's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in the form of composite heads. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas across its native range."
