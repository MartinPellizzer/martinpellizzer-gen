    "intro": "Hedysarum herbaceum, commonly known as the creeping yellow vetch, is a low-growing perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by cylindrical pods containing several seeds. Its trifoliate leaves consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Hedysarum herbaceum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and erosion control."
