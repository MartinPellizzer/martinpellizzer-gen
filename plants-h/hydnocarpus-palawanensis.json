    "intro": "Hydnocarpus palawanensis, commonly known as the Palawan hydnocarp, is a tropical tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Sapotaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and distinctive fruit morphology. The plant produces a hard, woody fruit that contains a single seed, which is often enclosed in a thick, fleshy aril. It thrives in humid, lowland forest environments and is valued for its timber and potential medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
