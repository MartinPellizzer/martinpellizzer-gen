    "intro": "Hydrocotyle quinqueloba var. macrophylla, commonly known as the broad-leaved water arum, is a herbaceous plant characterized by its large, arrow-shaped leaves that are often floating on the water surface. It belongs to the Araceae family and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The plant features a spadix surrounded by a showy spathe, which is typical of the arum family. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The leaves are usually light green with a waxy surface, aiding in buoyancy and light absorption."
