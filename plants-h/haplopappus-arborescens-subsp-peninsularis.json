    "intro": "Haplopappus arborescens subsp. peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular bush-mallow, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its woody stems, opposite leaves, and showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, pale yellow to white seeds enclosed in a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. This subspecies is part of the Malvaceae family, which includes cotton and hibiscus."
