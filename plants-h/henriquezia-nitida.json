    "intro": "Henriquezia nitida, commonly known as the white-flowered henriquezia, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring. Its flowers are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Henriquezia nitida is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
