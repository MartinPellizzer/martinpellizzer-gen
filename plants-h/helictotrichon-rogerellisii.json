    "intro": "Helictotrichon rogerellisii, commonly known as Rogerell's goatgrass, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, branched stems. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with both male and female flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Helictotrichon rogerellisii is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is adapted to semi-arid climates."
