    "intro": "Hedera helix f. minima, commonly known as the miniature English ivy, is a compact variety of ivy characterized by its small, dark green, glossy leaves. It is a trailing evergreen vine that thrives in shaded to partially sunny conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark berries, though it is primarily grown for its ornamental foliage. It is well-suited for hanging baskets, rock gardens, or as a ground cover. Due to its slow growth and dense foliage, it is often used in indoor and outdoor landscaping for its aesthetic appeal."
