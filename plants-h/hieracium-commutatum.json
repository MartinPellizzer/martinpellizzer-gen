    "intro": "Hieracium commutatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and its flowers are yellow with a central disc of tubular florets. Hieracium commutatum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
