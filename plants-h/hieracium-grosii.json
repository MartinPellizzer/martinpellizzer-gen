    "intro": "Hieracium grosii, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
