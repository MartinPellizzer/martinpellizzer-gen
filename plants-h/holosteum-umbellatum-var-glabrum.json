It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy, though the variety 'glabrum' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless surface. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant in suitable climates. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
