    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. kematense, commonly known as the Kematense hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has finely divided leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flower heads that are often overlooked. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species in its native range."
