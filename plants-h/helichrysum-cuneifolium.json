    "intro": "Helichrysum cuneifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces papery, drought-resistant bracts that persist after flowering, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum cuneifolium is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ornamental appeal."
