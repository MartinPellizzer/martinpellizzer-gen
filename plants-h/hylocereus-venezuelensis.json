It is native to South America, particularly Venezuela, and is characterized by its spineless stems and nocturnal flowering habit. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths. Its fruit, known as a dragon fruit, is edible and has a mild, sweet flavor. Hylocereus venezuelensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and unique fruit production."
