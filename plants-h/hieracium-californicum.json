    "intro": "Hieracium californicum, commonly known as the California hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows, often in areas with well-drained soils. It produces yellow to orange disk flowers surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both a pioneer species and a potential weed in certain environments."
