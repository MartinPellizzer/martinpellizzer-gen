It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. The plant features upright stems that bear basal and alternate leaves, which are usually lanceolate or ovate in shape. Its flowers are yellow, with a disc of tubular florets surrounded by ray florets, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves and is often found in open, nutrient-poor habitats."
