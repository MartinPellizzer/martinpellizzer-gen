    "intro": "Hyacinthus neglectus, commonly known as the desert hyacinth, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb with a short, branched stem and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late spring. Its botanical features include a fibrous root system adapted to drought conditions. Hyacinthus neglectus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor soils."
