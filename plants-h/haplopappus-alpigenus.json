    "intro": "Haplopappus alpigenus, commonly known as the alpine pappus, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, alpine conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by tufted bracts that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Haplopappus alpigenus is often found in open meadows and slopes, contributing to the biodiversity of alpine ecosystems."
