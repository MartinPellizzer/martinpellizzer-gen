    "intro": "Helleborus triphyllus, commonly known as the three-leaved hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It features dark green, waxy leaves that are typically trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It prefers shady, moist environments and has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Helleborus triphyllus is also valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to bloom during the winter months."
