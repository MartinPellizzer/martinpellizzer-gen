    "intro": "Hackelia elegans, commonly known as the fairy bells, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features slender, branching stems that bear clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its delicate, bell-like blooms that appear in late spring to early summer."
