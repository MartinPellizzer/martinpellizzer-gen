    "intro": "Heliomeris multiflora var. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada heliomeris, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in arid or semi-arid environments. It has hairy stems and leaves that help reduce water loss, adapting to its harsh habitat. The flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important species for local pollinators."
