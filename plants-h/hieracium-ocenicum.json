    "intro": "Hieracium ocenicum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are typically basal, with a rough texture. It is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas, and it can form dense colonies. Hieracium ocenicum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native plants due to its rapid growth and extensive root system."
