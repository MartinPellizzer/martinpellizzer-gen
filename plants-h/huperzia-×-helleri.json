    "intro": "Huperzia \u00d7 helleri, commonly known as the hybrid clubmoss, is a fern-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Huperzia selago and Huperzia hookeri, exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant has slender, creeping stems with whorled leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest floors or rocky crevices. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
