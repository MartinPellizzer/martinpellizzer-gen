It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit with dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous seeds.
