    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina subsp. font-queri, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to high-altitude environments. It belongs to the Apiaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth form and small, aromatic leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral morphology, featuring small, clustered umbels of white or pale yellow flowers. It typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
