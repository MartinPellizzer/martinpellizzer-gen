    "intro": "Hydrostachys distichophylla var. humblotii, commonly known as the dwarf waterplantain, is a compact aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant features narrow, linear leaves that are often arranged in two rows along the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually borne in dense clusters, and it produces small, dark seeds. This variety is valued in aquatic gardens for its ornamental appeal and ability to help control algae growth."
