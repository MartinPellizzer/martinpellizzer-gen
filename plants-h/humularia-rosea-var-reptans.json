It features small, rose-like flowers that bloom in late summer, typically in shades of pink or white. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in harsh environments. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and mountainous areas. Its botanical structure is adapted for survival in cold climates, with a compact growth habit and frost-resistant tissues."
