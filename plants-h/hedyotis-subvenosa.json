    "intro": "Hedyotis subvenosa, commonly known as the creeping bedstraw, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants with small, often fragrant flowers. The plant features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. Its small white or pale yellow flowers are typically arranged in clusters and bloom in early summer. Hedyotis subvenosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
