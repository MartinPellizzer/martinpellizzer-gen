    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. transalpinum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is characterized by its small, daisy-like inflorescences and is often found in mountainous areas across the Alps. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
