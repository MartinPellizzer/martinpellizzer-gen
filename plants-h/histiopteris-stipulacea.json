    "intro": "Histiopteris stipulacea, commonly known as the stipule fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically bright green and deeply divided. The plant produces spores in small, round clusters called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native ecosystems."
