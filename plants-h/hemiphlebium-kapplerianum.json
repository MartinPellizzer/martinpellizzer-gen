    "intro": "Hemiphlebium kapplerianum, commonly known as the Alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or shaded areas. Hemiphlebium kapplerianum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
