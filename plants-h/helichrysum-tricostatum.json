    "intro": "Helichrysum tricostatum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and showy yellow-orange flowers. The plant produces small, tightly packed flower heads that resemble tiny globes, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant traits. Helichrysum tricostatum thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
