    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. pseudacuminatum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and often reddish in color. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. This subspecies is often confused with other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its slender stems and smaller flower heads."
