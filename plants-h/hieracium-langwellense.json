    "intro": "Hieracium langwellense, commonly known as the Langwell's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. It has basal leaves that are often heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
