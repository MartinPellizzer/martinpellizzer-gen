    "intro": "Hedyotis glaucifolia var. subimpressa, commonly known as the glossy buttonweed, is a variant of the species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its small, glabrous, and often glossy leaves that are typically ovate to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers, which are usually borne on short pedicels. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Hedyotis species, particularly in leaf texture and floral arrangement."
