    "intro": "Hemionitis platychlamys, commonly known as the broad-leafed hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, broad, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis platychlamys thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
