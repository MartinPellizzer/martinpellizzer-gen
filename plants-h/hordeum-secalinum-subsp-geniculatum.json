It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with two-rowed grains, typical of the Hordeum genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for ecological studies and agricultural research."
