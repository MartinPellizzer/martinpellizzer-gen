    "intro": "Hieracium integrifolium var. oleicolor, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has basal leaves that are broadly ovate with serrated edges, and the stems are usually hairy and somewhat reddish in color. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
