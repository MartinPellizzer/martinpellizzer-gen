It is native to South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plants are typically herbaceous, with strap-like leaves and produce showy blooms in shades of white, pink, and purple. Habropetalum species are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses. They thrive in well-drained soil and prefer warm, humid conditions."
