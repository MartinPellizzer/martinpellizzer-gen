    "intro": "Heteropterys argentea, commonly known as silverleaf tree or silverleaf guarea, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, leathery, silver-green leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, spiny fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. The leaves are used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
