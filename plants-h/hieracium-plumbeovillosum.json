    "intro": "Hieracium plumbeovillosum, commonly known as the blue-haired hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, bluish-gray stems and leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flower heads that are clustered in a single inflorescence, often resembling a dandelion. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
