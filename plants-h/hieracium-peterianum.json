    "intro": "Hieracium peterianum, commonly known as the Peter's Hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. It has alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy, and its flowering period occurs from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium peterianum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
