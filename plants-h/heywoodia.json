It consists of several species, most of which are native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. The plants are typically low-growing, mat-forming shrubs with fleshy, succulent leaves. They produce small, clustered flowers that are often yellow or greenish in color. Heywoodia is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a hardy plant for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
