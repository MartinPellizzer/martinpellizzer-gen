    "intro": "Hesperocyparis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf incense cedar, is a small evergreen conifer native to the coastal regions of California and southern Oregon. It typically grows to a height of only 2 to 5 meters, featuring a compact, rounded form with dense, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, aromatic cones that release a strong, resinous scent, a characteristic feature of the cypress family. Its foliage is dark green and remains throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. Hesperocyparis pygmaea is well adapted to coastal climates, tolerating salt spray and mild frosts."
