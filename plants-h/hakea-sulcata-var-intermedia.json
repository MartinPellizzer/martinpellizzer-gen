    "intro": "Hakea sulcata var. intermedia, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in clusters. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It is adapted to coastal environments and can tolerate salt spray and sandy soils. This variety is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental features."
