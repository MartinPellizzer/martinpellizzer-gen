    "intro": "Hieracium latisinuosum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, lobed leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has hairy stems and is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies, it can compete with native plant species in certain regions."
