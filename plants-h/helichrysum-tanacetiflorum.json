It features finely divided, silvery-gray leaves that resemble those of tanacetum, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces daisy-like yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are known for their long-lasting nature when dried, often used in floral arrangements."
