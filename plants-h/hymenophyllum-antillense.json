    "intro": "Hymenophyllum antillense, commonly known as the Antillean haircap moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures called rhizoids. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are usually narrow and linear, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Hymenophyllum antillense plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the biodiversity of forest understories."
