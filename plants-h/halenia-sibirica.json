    "intro": "Halenia sibirica, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia, including Siberia and the Himalayas. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in a fine layer of white hair, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Halenia sibirica is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
