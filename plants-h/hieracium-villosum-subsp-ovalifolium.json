It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are oval-shaped, hairy, and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, daisy-like cluster. It is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
