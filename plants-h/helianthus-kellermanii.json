    "intro": "Helianthus kellermanii, commonly known as Kellerman's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly Florida and Georgia, where it grows in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. The plant typically reaches heights of 1 to 3 meters, featuring bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular florets. Its leaves are lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and the plant produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Helianthus kellermanii is often found in moist, sandy soils and is adapted to coastal environments."
