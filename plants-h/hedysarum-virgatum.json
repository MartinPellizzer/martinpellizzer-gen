    "intro": "Hedysarum virgatum, commonly known as sweet clover, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Sweet clover is also valued for its role in soil enrichment and as a forage crop."
