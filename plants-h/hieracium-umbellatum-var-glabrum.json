    "intro": "Hieracium umbellatum var. glabrum, commonly known as the smooth buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of broadly ovate, smooth, and glossy leaves that are typically green to reddish in color. The plant produces a cluster of yellow flowers in an umbel, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
