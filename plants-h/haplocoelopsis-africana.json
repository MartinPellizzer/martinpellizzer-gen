The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white or greenish flowers arranged in umbels. Its flowering period usually occurs during the cooler months, and it is often found in association with other woodland species. The plant's botanical characteristics make it an important component of the understory vegetation in its native habitat."
