    "intro": "Hedysarum giganteum, commonly known as the giant sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that can reach up to 2 meters in height, and its compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in elongated clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum giganteum has a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
