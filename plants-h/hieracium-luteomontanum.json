    "intro": "Hieracium luteomontanum, commonly known as the yellow mountain hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny conditions. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green ray florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped achenes as seeds. Hieracium luteomontanum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
