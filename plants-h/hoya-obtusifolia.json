    "intro": "Hoya obtusifolia, commonly known as the wax plant or the sweetheart plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming during the summer months. Hoya obtusifolia is a popular houseplant due to its ease of care and ability to thrive in low-light conditions. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots when grown in hanging baskets."
