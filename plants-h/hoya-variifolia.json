    "intro": "Hoya variifolia, commonly known as the variegated wax plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, ovate leaves that often display a mix of green, white, and pink hues. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pink, which bloom at the ends of its stems. Hoya variifolia thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil. It is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
