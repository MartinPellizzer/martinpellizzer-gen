    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. calvifrons, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in grassy areas and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies distinction is based on the presence of hairy stems and leaves, as well as differences in flower structure. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered a common weed in certain regions."
