The plant has long, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, aiding in photosynthesis in aquatic conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually greenish-white in color, and appear in summer. Hydrophila plays an important role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
