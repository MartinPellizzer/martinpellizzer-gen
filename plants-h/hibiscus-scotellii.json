    "intro": "Hibiscus scotellii, commonly known as the rock hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showcasing its adaptability to harsh environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a striking yellow center. Its leaves are usually narrow and gray-green, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hibiscus scotellii is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in drought conditions."
