It is a climbing plant that can develop a shrub-like appearance, making it distinct from its typical ivy relatives. The plant features dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy texture, and it produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red berries. Native to the Caucasus region, it thrives in shady, moist environments. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a striking yet adaptable plant."
