    "intro": "Helianthus agrestis, commonly known as the woodland sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It features upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a rough texture. The plant produces yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of smaller tubular flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Helianthus agrestis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
