It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. Its flowers have five petals and are pollinated by insects, contributing to its ecological role in supporting pollinators. The plant is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions."
