It features distinctive white or yellow tubercles on its fleshy, dark green leaves, giving it a zebra-like appearance. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white flowers during the summer months. Haworthia salina is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its compact size and unique appearance."
