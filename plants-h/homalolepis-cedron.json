    "intro": "Homalolepis cedron, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a flowering plant native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Anacardiaceae and is characterized by its distinctive red heartwood, which is highly valued for its durability and aesthetic appeal. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with compound leaves and small, clustered flowers. Its botanical significance lies in its unique morphology and ecological role within its native habitat. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered an endangered species."
