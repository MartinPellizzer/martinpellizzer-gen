    "intro": "Haloragis prostrata subsp. tuvaluensis, commonly known as Tuvaluan prostrate willow, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to the Tuvalu archipelago. It typically forms dense mats near the shoreline, thriving in sandy or rocky coastal environments. The plant has slender, prostrate stems with small, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. This species is adapted to salt spray and is an important component of the coastal vegetation in its native habitat."
