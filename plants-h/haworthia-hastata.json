    "intro": "Haworthia hastata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are often marked with distinct white or yellow markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy leaves. It produces small, white or pink flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. Haworthia hastata is popular as a low-maintenance houseplant due to its ability to thrive in bright, indirect light and minimal watering."
