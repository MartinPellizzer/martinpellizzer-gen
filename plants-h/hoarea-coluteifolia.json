    "intro": "Hoarea coluteifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hoarea, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a dense, terminal spike, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Hoarea coluteifolia typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
