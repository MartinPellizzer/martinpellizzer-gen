    "intro": "Hydrocotyle verticillata var. pluriradiata, commonly known as the creeping marsh plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments. It features a rosette of heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread across moist soils and form dense mats. It is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams."
