    "intro": "Hesperonia limosa var. retrorsa, commonly known as the slender hesperonia, is a perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant features slender, ascending stems that are often hairy, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are usually arranged alternately along the stem. Its small, white to pale blue flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. This variety is distinguished by its reflexed (curled backward) flower buds, a characteristic that sets it apart from other varieties within the Hesperonia genus."
