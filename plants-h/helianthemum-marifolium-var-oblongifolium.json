    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium var. oblongifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are narrow and elliptical, with a slightly fuzzy texture, adapting well to rocky and arid environments. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal areas. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
