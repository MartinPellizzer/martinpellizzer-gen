    "intro": "Hieracium lycopifolium proles neoprenanthes, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, hairy leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and wetlands. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
