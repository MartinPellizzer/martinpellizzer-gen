    "intro": "Hakea decurrens subsp. platytaenia, commonly known as the broad-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage composed of narrow, linear to oblanceolate leaves. The plant produces cylindrical, yellow-green flower spikes that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its adaptability to sandy soils and drought conditions makes it a hardy plant in arid environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader leaves compared to other Hakea species."
