    "intro": "Hesiodia remota, commonly known as the remote hesiodia, is a flowering plant native to parts of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are clustered in dense, spherical heads, and it produces small, dry fruits called achenes. Hesiodia remota is often found in arid or semi-arid regions, where it has adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
