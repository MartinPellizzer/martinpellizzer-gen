    "intro": "Huperzia scabrida, commonly known as the rough huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are often covered in a rough, scaly texture. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Huperzia scabrida is a cryptogamic plant, meaning it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Its rhizome system helps it anchor in soil and absorb nutrients efficiently."
