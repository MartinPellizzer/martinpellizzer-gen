    "intro": "Hieracium lutnjaermense, commonly known as the Lutnjaermense hawkweed, is a flowering plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its daisy-like flowers, which typically consist of yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves that are often lobed or toothed, with a general appearance resembling other members of the Hieracium genus. Native to specific regions in Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in moist or calcareous soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
