    "intro": "Hornungia procumbens, commonly known as the prostrate hornungia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Montiaceae and is characterized by its mat-forming growth habit with small, fleshy leaves. The plant produces tiny, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Hornungia procumbens plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small Arctic organisms."
