    "intro": "Hedysarum humile var. laxum, commonly known as the slender sweet clover, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with a trailing or climbing habit. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its trifoliate leaves are compound, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and the roots are known for their nitrogen-fixing ability. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in soil stabilization and forage production."
