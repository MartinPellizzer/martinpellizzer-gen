    "intro": "Hancornia floribunda, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a tropical tree native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its thick, bark-like leaves that are adapted to withstand saltwater spray. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy berries. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize coastal soils and filter water. Hancornia floribunda plays a vital ecological role in mangrove ecosystems, providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
