    "intro": "Hypericum lanuginosum var. gracile, commonly known as the slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow, four-petaled flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has wiry, slightly hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its compact size and ornamental flowers, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic value."
