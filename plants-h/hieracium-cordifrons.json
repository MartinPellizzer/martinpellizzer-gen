It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. Its leaves are heart-shaped, hence the species name *cordifrons*, and are covered in fine hairs. The flowers are yellow and bloom in summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind."
