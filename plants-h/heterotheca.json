    "intro": "Heterotheca, commonly known as the ironweed, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to North America and are characterized by their upright growth habit and showy, purple or pink flower heads. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are often hairy and rigid. Heterotheca species are often found in prairies, open woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance as a food source for pollinators."
