    "intro": "Helianthemum lavandulifolium var. syriacum, commonly known as the Syrian rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Middle East and parts of southern Europe. It is a low-growing shrub with gray-green, aromatic leaves that resemble those of lavender. The plant produces clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and arid environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in traditional medicine in some regions."
