    "intro": "Hedysarum hirtum, commonly known as the hairy vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, trifoliate leaves, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces cylindrical, hairy pods that contain several seeds, and it is often used as a cover crop due to its nitrogen-fixing abilities. Hedysarum hirtum thrives in well-drained soils and is adaptable to a variety of climates, making it a versatile plant in both agricultural and ecological settings."
