    "intro": "Hieracium seneppense, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium seneppense is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
