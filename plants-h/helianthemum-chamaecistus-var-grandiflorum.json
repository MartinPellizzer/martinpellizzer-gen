It features small, evergreen leaves that are covered in fine white hairs, providing a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in xeriscaping and as a drought-tolerant ornamental plant."
