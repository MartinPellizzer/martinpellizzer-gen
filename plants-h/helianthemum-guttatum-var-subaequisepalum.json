    "intro": "Helianthemum guttatum var. subaequisepalum, commonly known as the spotted stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in white dots. It produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It is drought-tolerant and prefers full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
