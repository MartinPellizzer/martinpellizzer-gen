    "intro": "Helleboroides sibiricum, commonly known as Siberian bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the cold climates of Siberia and Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that help it survive harsh winters. The plant produces striking blue to purple flowers in early summer, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens in temperate regions."
