    "intro": "Hydrobryum subcrustaceum, commonly known as the crustacean moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its moist, shaded habitats. This plant typically grows in wet, rocky areas or on the bark of trees in temperate regions. Its reproductive structures, known as capsules, are borne on short, erect stalks and release spores into the air. Hydrobryum subcrustaceum plays a minor but important role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its native ecosystems."
