It is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that consist of both ray and disk florets. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered with fine, glandular hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in grassy habitats and disturbed soils. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
