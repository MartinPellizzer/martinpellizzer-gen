    "intro": "Hakea pachylostyla, commonly known as the thick-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, woody stems and clusters of bright red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Hakea pachylostyla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing nectar for native pollinators."
