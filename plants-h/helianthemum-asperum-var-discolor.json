    "intro": "Helianthemum asperum var. discolor, commonly known as the rough sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial shrub characterized by its gray-green foliage and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving the plant a rough texture, while the flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal and coastal dune environments. This plant is well adapted to harsh, sunny conditions and is commonly used in coastal restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
