    "intro": "Holodiscus discolor proles eudiscolor, commonly known as the variegated tree fern, is a unique plant characterized by its striking variegated foliage. It belongs to the family Cyatheaceae and is native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. The plant features a tall, unbranched trunk covered in a fibrous sheath, with fronds that are often light green with white or yellow markings. Its growth habit is slow, making it a popular choice for ornamental purposes in shaded garden environments. The variegation in its fronds is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, resulting in its distinctive appearance."
