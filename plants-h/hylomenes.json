    "intro": "Hylomenes, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate white flowers that resemble a ghostly apparition. The plant relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are pollinated by specific species of moths, making it highly dependent on its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hylomenes is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
