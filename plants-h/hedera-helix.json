    "intro": "Hedera helix, commonly known as the common ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features dark green, lobed leaves that are typically glossy and have a waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera helix thrives in shaded areas and is often used in horticulture for ground cover or as a climbing plant. Its adaptability and aesthetic appeal make it a popular choice in gardens and indoor spaces."
