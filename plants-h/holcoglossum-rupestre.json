It typically grows in rocky or limestone habitats, often in mountainous regions. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with a short rhizome and a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowers are usually small, pale green or yellowish, and are arranged in a spike. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
