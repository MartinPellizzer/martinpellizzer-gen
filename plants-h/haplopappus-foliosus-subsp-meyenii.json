    "intro": "Haplopappus foliosus subsp. meyenii, commonly known as the desert pappus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of North America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to survive in harsh, drought-prone environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. The small, yellowish flowers bloom in the spring and are followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds."
