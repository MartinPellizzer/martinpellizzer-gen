    "intro": "Halleria ilicifolia, commonly known as the African snowball, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, evergreen foliage with leathery, dark green leaves. The plant produces clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in winter, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its fruit is a woody capsule that splits open to release small, hard seeds. Halleria ilicifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to well-drained, sandy soils."
