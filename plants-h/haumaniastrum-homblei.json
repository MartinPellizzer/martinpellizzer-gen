    "intro": "Haumaniastrum homblei, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to drought conditions. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Its leaves are typically small, narrow, and arranged oppositely along the stems. The plant is also known for its ability to tolerate extreme temperatures and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
