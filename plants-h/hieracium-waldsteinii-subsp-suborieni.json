    "intro": "Hieracium waldsteinii subsp. suborieni, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and it is pollinated primarily by insects. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh mountain environments."
