    "intro": "Hoya dolichosparte, commonly known as the long-spur hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy stems and clusters of small, waxy, white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces nectar-rich flowers that attract pollinators such as birds and insects. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya dolichosparte is also valued for its decorative foliage, which features dark green, velvety leaves."
