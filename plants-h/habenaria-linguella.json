    "intro": "Habenaria linguella, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a species of orchid native to the eastern United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its dense, dark green, grass-like foliage and its long, spiraling inflorescence of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swamps. It is a perennial herb that spreads by rhizomes, forming dense colonies. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological significance in its native habitat."
