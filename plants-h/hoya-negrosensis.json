    "intro": "Hoya negrosensis, commonly known as the Negros Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces a milky sap that is toxic to some animals. Hoya negrosensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings."
