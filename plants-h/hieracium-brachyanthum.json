It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has basal leaves that are narrow and often hairy, and its yellow flowers bloom in clusters. Hieracium brachyanthum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
