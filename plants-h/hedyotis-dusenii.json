    "intro": "Hedyotis dusenii, commonly known as the Dusen's inchplant, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It typically features slender, creeping stems that produce small, opposite leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant bears clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are usually borne in the axils of the leaves. Hedyotis dusenii is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forest undergrowth or rocky crevices. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for ecological studies and potential medicinal applications."
