    "intro": "Helichrysum paleatum, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and bright yellow flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms with yellow petals and a central disk, which are often used in floral arrangements due to their durability. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum paleatum is also valued for its aromatic foliage and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
