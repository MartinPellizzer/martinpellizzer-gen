    "intro": "Hymenophyllum australe var. crispatum, commonly known as the curly maidenhair fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern native to Australia. It features finely divided, dark green fronds that are often curled or crisped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in humid, indoor settings."
