    "intro": "Hemitelia capensis, commonly known as the Cape hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue or violet tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Hemitelia capensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique floral display."
