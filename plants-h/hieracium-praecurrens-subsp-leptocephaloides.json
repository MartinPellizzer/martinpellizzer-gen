    "intro": "Hieracium praecurrens subsp. leptocephaloides, commonly known as the slender-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are shorter than the central disk florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, elongated flower heads and smaller, more compact leaves compared to other hawkweed species."
