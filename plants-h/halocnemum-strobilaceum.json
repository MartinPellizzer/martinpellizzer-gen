It is a member of the Amaranthaceae family and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent leaves. The plant thrives in coastal and desert regions where it tolerates high salinity and low moisture. Its structure includes a prostrate growth habit with branched stems and small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss.
