    "intro": "Hypericum japonicum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are broader than those of the typical H. japonicum. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are composed of numerous small petals and stamens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
