    "intro": "Hortia, commonly known as the \"flower of the sea,\" is a unique plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub that thrives in saline and sandy environments, adapting to harsh coastal conditions. The plant's most distinctive feature is its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. Hortia has a compact growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in arid climates. It is often cultivated in coastal gardens for its ornamental value and resilience."
