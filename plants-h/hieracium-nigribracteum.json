It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are generally basal, with a rough or hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow, often with dark bracts at the base.
