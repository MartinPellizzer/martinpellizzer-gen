    "intro": "Hieracium diplax, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium diplax is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
