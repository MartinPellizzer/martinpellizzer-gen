    "intro": "Hydrangea arguta, commonly known as the snowball hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, rounded clusters of small white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Hydrangea arguta is also valued for its ability to change flower color based on soil pH, though this trait is more pronounced in other hydrangea species."
