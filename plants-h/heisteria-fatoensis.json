    "intro": "Heisteria fatoensis, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, Heisteria fatoensis is considered a conservation concern."
