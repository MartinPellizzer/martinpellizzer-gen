    "intro": "Hymenophyllum wrightii, commonly known as Wright's filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its thin, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is notable for its intricate, lace-like appearance and its role in epiphytic ecosystems."
