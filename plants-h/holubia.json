    "intro": "Holubia, commonly known as the white wood sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are native to various regions of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, often thriving in temperate climates. Holubia species typically have trifoliate leaves, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plants are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making them valuable in ecological restoration. They are also sometimes cultivated as ornamental plants due to their delicate appearance."
