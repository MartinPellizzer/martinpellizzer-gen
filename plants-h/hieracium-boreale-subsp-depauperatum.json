    "intro": "Hieracium boreale subsp. depauperatum, commonly known as the northern hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to northern Europe and parts of Asia. It typically forms dense mats of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its reduced floral structure and is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. It is considered a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and has a fibrous root system. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is sometimes regarded as a rare or threatened species in certain regions."
