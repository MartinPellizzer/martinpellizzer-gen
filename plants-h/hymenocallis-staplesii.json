It is native to the Caribbean and features showy, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive, narrow, spidery shape. The plant produces a tall, leafless stem that bears several clustered blooms, often with a sweet, spicy fragrance. Its leaves are broad, strap-like, and emerge from a bulbous underground stem. Hymenocallis staplesii is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
