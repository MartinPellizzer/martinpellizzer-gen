    "intro": "Hedysarum paniculatum, commonly known as the yellow peavine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a perennial legume that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring trifoliate leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elongated, cylindrical pods that contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hedysarum paniculatum is characterized by its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root system."
