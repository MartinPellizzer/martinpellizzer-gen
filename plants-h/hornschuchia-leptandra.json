    "intro": "Hornschuchia leptandra, commonly known as the slender horned bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy and have a distinct, slightly rough texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, typically found in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
