    "intro": "Hierochloe elongata, commonly known as slender bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green blades and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or disturbed soils. The plant typically grows in open, sunny environments such as meadows, hillsides, and forest edges. Its leaves are narrow, slightly rolled, and have a distinctive blue-gray coloration due to a waxy coating. Hierochloe elongata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil and supporting pollinators."
