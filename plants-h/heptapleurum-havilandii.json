    "intro": "Heptapleurum havilandii, commonly known as the Haviland's stone pine, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a lanceolate shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often cultivated as a decorative plant in horticulture."
