    "intro": "Hemionitis spiculata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf waterwheel plant, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. The plant has delicate, spirally arranged leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis spiculata is characterized by its unique ability to absorb nutrients directly from the water, making it an important species in aquatic ecosystems."
