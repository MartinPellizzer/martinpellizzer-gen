    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fucoides var. fucoides, commonly known as the common rock fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and Africa. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique, moss-like appearance with a dense, velvety coating on its leaves. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocky surfaces."
