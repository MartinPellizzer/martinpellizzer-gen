    "intro": "Heptas repens, commonly known as the creeping heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, dark green, leathery leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, bell-shaped, white or pale pink flowers during the spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
