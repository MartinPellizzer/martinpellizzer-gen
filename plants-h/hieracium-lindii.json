    "intro": "Hieracium lindii, commonly known as Lind's hawkweed, is a perennial plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellow flowers. Native to the western United States, it thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Its ecological role includes providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain insect species."
