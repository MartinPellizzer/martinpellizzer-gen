It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the western United States, particularly found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features slender, branching stems covered in small, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are typically pale blue or violet, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems.
