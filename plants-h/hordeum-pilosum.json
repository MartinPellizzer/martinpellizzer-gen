The plant produces small, spikelet-based flowers that are typically green or pale in color. Hordeum pilosum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. It is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and ability to stabilize soil."
