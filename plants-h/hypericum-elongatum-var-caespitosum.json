    "intro": "Hypericum elongatum var. caespitosum, commonly known as creeping St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features wiry, prostrate stems that form dense mats, often covering the ground with a mat-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer and are clustered in loose inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and slightly hairy, contributing to its ornamental appeal in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover."
