    "intro": "Humiria floribunda var. montana, commonly known as the mountain hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in mountainous areas, often in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and ovate, with a rough, hairy texture that helps it retain moisture in cooler climates. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
