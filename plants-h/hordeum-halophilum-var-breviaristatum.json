    "intro": "Hordeum halophilum var. breviaristatum, commonly known as the coastal barley, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It exhibits compact growth with short, rigid spikes that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The leaves are narrow and bluish-green, with a waxy coating to minimize desiccation. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes, often forming dense vegetation that stabilizes soil. This variety is valued for its ecological role in preventing erosion and supporting coastal biodiversity."
