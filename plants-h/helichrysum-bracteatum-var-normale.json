    "intro": "Helichrysum bracteatum var. normale, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of yellow, sun-like flowers that resemble small suns, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, papery bracts that persist after the flowers have faded, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The species is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
