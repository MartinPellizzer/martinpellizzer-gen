    "intro": "Hakea wilsonii, commonly known as Wilson's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features narrow, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces striking red or orange cylindrical flower spikes during the spring and summer months. It is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in full sun. Hakea wilsonii is often used in native gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
