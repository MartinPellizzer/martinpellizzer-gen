    "intro": "Hormidium coriaceum, commonly known as the rough bladderwort, is a unique aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibacillaceae. It is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures called bladders, which are used to trap microscopic organisms. The plant is typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. Its leaves are short and often lack true roots, adapting to its submerged or floating lifestyle. Hormidium coriaceum plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various microorganisms."
