    "intro": "Homalocenchrus ovatus, commonly known as the sand hopper, is a small, globally distributed grassland and coastal plant. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or disturbed soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its adaptability, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
