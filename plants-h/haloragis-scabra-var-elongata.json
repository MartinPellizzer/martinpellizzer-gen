    "intro": "Haloragis scabra var. elongata, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and specialized structures called bladders, which are used for capturing microscopic aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in shallow, brackish or saltwater habitats such as tidal flats and coastal marshes. Its reproductive structures are often submerged, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, saline soils, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
