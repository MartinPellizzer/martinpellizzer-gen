    "intro": "Hydrophila aquatica, commonly known as water hyacinth, is a free-floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has bright blue-violet flowers and dark green, waxy leaves that allow it to float on the water's surface. The plant spreads rapidly through vegetative reproduction, forming dense mats that can cover entire water bodies. Its roots are submerged, absorbing nutrients from the water, which can lead to eutrophication if left unchecked. Hydrophila aquatica is an invasive species in many regions, often disrupting local ecosystems and waterways."
