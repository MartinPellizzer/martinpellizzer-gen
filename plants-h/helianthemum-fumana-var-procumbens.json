It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically from April to June. The plant has succulent, hairy leaves that are adapted to dry, sandy soils. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or gravelly habitats. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
