    "intro": "Hoya nummularia, commonly known as the \"Chinese Jade\" or \"Rosy Wreath,\" is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy, and often variegated leaves that can range from light green to pink and white. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late summer or early autumn. Hoya nummularia thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its aesthetic appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
