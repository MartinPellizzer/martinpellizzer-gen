    "intro": "Helichrysum elatum var. fraseri, commonly known as the Fraser's everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its showy, golden-yellow flower heads that resemble small suns. The plant produces tiny, tubular flowers that are typically clustered in spherical or conical shapes, which give it its common name. The leaves are narrow, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its low water requirements and long-lasting blooms."
