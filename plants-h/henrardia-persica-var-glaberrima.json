    "intro": "Henrardia persica var. glaberrima, commonly known as the Persian henrardia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking, waxy leaves that exhibit a unique coloration pattern. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
