    "intro": "Hieracium krasanii subsp. pseudonigritiforme, commonly known as the Krasan hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native habitat."
