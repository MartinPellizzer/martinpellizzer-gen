    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. barbisquamum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a dense cluster at the end of each stem. Its subspecies barbisquamum is distinguished by its elongated, bristle-tipped leaves and smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other varieties. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
