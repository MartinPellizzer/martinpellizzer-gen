    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium var. denticulatum, commonly known as the serrated stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, narrow leaves with serrated edges, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appearance make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
