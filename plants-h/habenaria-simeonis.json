    "intro": "Habenaria simeonis, commonly known as the Simeon's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive lip. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
