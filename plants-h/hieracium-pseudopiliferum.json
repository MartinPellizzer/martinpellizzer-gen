    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopiliferum, commonly known as the false pilose hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by seeds dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
