It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat head. It is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
