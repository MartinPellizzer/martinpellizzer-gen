It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, with both ray and disc florets. It is an herbaceous perennial that produces seeds through a process called cleistogamy, where flowers close and self-pollinate before opening."
