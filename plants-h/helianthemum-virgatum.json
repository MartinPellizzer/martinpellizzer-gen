    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum, commonly known as the pink rockrose, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant produces small, pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer, adding color to its rugged habitat. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum virgatum is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
