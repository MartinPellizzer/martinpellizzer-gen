    "intro": "Hyacinthoides patula, commonly known as the bluebell, is a perennial bulbous plant native to western Europe. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, bright green leaves and clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale blue to deep violet. The plant produces small, round, brown seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its natural propagation. It thrives in woodland settings and prefers partial shade with well-drained, moist soil. Hyacinthoides patula is a key component of the UK's native flora and is often found in ancient woodlands."
