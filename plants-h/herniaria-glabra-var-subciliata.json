    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. subciliata, commonly known as the smooth bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arid and rocky habitats. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, and often succulent leaves that are covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. This variety is distinguished by its smooth, ciliate-leaf margins, which set it apart from other varieties of Herniaria."
