    "intro": "Hebe elliptica, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its slender, upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are usually a deep green. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe elliptica is also valued for its hardiness and low maintenance requirements."
