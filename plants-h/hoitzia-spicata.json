    "intro": "Hoitzia spicata, commonly known as the spike heath, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest undergrowth or rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, with a glossy appearance, and it produces small, berry-like fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans.
