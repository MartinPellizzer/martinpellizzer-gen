It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
