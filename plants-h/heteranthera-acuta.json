    "intro": "Heteranthera acuta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water hyssop, is a herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Plantaginaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikes of small, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to aquatic conditions. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. Heteranthera acuta is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life."
