    "intro": "Hieracium basiunguiculum, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads made up of many small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. It produces yellow flowers with ray florets and has a rosette of basal leaves that are usually narrow and lobed. The species is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some regions."
