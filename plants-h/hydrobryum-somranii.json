    "intro": "Hydrobryum somranii, commonly known as the Somranii water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of southern Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically divided into small, clover-like segments. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and marshes. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, usually greenish-white in color, and it reproduces through spores rather than seeds. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hydrobryum somranii is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
