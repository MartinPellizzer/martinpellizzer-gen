It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually basal, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed but can serve as a food source for certain insects."
