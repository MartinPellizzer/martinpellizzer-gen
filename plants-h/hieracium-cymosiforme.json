    "intro": "Hieracium cymosiforme, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and numerous yellow flowers arranged in a cymose inflorescence. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. Hieracium cymosiforme is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
