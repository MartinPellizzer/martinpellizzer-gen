    "intro": "Huperzia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved huperzia, is a species of clubmoss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its evergreen, lanceolate leaves that are often broad at the base and taper to a point. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky areas, and is native to regions in Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. Its sporophytes produce spores in capsules that are clustered at the tips of the stems. Huperzia obtusifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in horticulture for its foliage."
