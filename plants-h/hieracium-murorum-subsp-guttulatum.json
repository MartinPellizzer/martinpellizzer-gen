    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. guttulatum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its distinctive yellow-orange spots on the leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
