    "intro": "Hayata, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the Nymphaeaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy flowers that bloom on long, upright stems. The plant thrives in shallow freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, and requires still water for optimal growth. Its leaves are broad and circular, often floating on the water's surface, while its roots are submerged. The lotus is also notable for its ability to produce clean, fragrant flowers that symbolize purity and spiritual enlightenment in many cultures."
