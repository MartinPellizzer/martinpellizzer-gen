    "intro": "Helichrysum asperum var. albidulum, commonly known as the white everlasting, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage and small, fluffy, white or pale yellow flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant produces numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to thrive in dry, open habitats. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine for its potential anti-inflammatory properties."
