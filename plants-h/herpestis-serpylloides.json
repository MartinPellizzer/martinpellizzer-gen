    "intro": "Herpestis serpylloides, commonly known as the slender false nettle, is a herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces and small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. It is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance but lacks the stinging hairs."
