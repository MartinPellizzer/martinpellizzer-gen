    "intro": "Hemipilia chidori, commonly known as the Japanese ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to Japan. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale pink or white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant typically grows on cliffs or tree roots, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology includes thin, wiry stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia chidori is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
