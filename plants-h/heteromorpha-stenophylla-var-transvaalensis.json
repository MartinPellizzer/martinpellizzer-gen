    "intro": "Heteromorpha stenophylla var. transvaalensis, commonly known as the Transvaal waterwheel, is a striking aquatic plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of narrow, strap-like leaves that radiate from a central stem. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to the substrate. Its leaves are typically green to bluish-green and can grow up to 30 cm in length. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in water garden settings."
