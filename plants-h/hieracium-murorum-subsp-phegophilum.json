    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. phegophilum, commonly known as the purple meadowhawk, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its upright growth habit and showy, daisy-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale purple to violet flower heads, which are typically surrounded by a ring of white or pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often growing in nutrient-poor soils. The plant is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction, making it a common sight in its native range."
