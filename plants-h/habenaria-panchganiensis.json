    "intro": "Habenaria panchganiensis, commonly known as the Panchgani orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a loose raceme, which are typically pollinated by flies. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
