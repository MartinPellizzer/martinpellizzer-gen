    "intro": "Hypericum acutum var. imperforatum, commonly known as the smooth St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features slender, woody stems with opposite, elliptic to ovate leaves that are typically smooth and lack leaflets. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. This variant is distinguished by its lack of leaf perforations, setting it apart from other varieties within the Hypericum genus."
