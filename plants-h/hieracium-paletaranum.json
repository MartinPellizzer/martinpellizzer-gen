    "intro": "Hieracium paletaranum, commonly known as the pale yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as meadows and roadsides. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
