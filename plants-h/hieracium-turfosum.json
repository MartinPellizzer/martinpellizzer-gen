    "intro": "Hieracium turfosum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soil. It features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with flowering stems that bear yellow-orange flowers. Hieracium turfosum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies that can dominate certain habitats."
