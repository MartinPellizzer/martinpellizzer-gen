    "intro": "Hippocratea tortuosa, commonly known as the spiral bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of South America. It features compound leaves with alternating leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, spiral-shaped pods. The plant is characterized by its unique helical twisting of its pod, which gives it its common name. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in forest understories. The seeds within the spiral pods are edible and have been used in traditional culinary practices."
