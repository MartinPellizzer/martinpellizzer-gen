    "intro": "Hydriastele boumae, commonly known as the Bouma's hydriastele, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often colorful flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and possess a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
