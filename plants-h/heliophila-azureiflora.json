    "intro": "Heliophila azureiflora, commonly known as the blue-flowered heliophila, is a flowering plant belonging to the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, clustered inflorescences that display a striking shade of blue, which is due to the presence of specific pigments in its petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade conditions. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, often emitting a subtle fragrance when crushed. Heliophila azureiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
