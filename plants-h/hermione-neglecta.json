    "intro": "Hermione neglecta, commonly known as the forgotten fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a graceful appearance. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its small, inconspicuous flowers appear in early spring, followed by spore-bearing structures called sori. Due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in neglected spaces, it is sometimes used in naturalistic garden designs."
