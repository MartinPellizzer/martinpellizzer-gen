    "intro": "Helonias yunnanensis var. yunnanensis, commonly known as the Yunnan helonias, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its striking, showy inflorescences composed of numerous small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a short, stout rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
