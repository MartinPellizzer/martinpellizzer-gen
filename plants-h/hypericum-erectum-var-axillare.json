    "intro": "Hypericum erectum var. axillare, commonly known as the upright St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not particularly palatable. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens or borders. Its medicinal properties are similar to other Hypericum species, though it is less commonly used in traditional herbal remedies."
