    "intro": "Hydrocotyle asiatica, commonly known as Asiatic shield-leaf, is a flowering plant native to Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in wet or marshy environments, often forming dense mats near water bodies. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating or submerged, with small white flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Hydrocotyle asiatica is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
