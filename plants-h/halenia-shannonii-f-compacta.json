    "intro": "Halenia shannonii f. compacta, commonly known as the compact halenia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with a glossy appearance, and its small, bell-shaped flowers are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
