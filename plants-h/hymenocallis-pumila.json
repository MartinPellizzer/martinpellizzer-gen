    "intro": "Hymenocallis pumila, commonly known as the dwarf hurricane lily, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of only a few inches, making it a compact and ornamental choice for gardens. The plant produces striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, with a prominent central stigma. Its leaves are broad and arrow-shaped, and it thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Hymenocallis pumila is valued for its resilience and ability to bloom reliably in warm climates."
