    "intro": "Hieracium floribundum subsp. stenomacellatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and shorter flower heads compared to other members of the species. It typically thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils, often forming dense mats. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
