    "intro": "Hugonia magnifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hugonia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Hugonia magnifolia thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or wetland habitats."
