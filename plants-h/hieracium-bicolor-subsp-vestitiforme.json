    "intro": "Hieracium bicolor subsp. vestitiforme, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with a hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. The subspecies vestitiforme is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, giving it a unique appearance."
