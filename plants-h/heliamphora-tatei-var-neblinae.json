    "intro": "Heliamphora tatei var. neblinae, commonly known as the Neblina's sun pitcher, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its elongated, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a sticky nectar to trap insects. The plant thrives in high humidity and cool temperatures, typical of its montane habitat. Its pitchers are often adorned with intricate patterns and can vary in color from green to reddish hues. This variant is notable for its unique adaptations to nutrient-poor environments, making it a subject of interest in botanical research."
