    "intro": "Hieracium lanifolium subsp. colmeiroanum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. The plant features basal rosettes of softly hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly foliage and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
