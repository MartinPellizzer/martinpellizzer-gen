    "intro": "Hibiscus fitzgeraldii, commonly known as the Fitzgerald's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, with woody stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. Hibiscus fitzgeraldii thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to its harsh environment. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
