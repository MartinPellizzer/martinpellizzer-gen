It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often lobed. Its flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Hieracium sorianum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
