It is characterized by its drooping, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The species is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
