    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopikujense, commonly known as the Pikujenskaya hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
