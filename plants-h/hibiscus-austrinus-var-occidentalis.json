    "intro": "Hibiscus austrinus var. occidentalis, commonly known as the western sand hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of western Australia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. The plant features heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Hibiscus austrinus var. occidentalis is adapted to coastal conditions, making it resilient to salt spray and wind."
