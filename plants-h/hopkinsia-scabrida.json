    "intro": "Hopkinsia scabrida, commonly known as the rough hopkinsia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its fibrous, hairy stems and narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is extensive and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in poor, well-drained soils. Hopkinsia scabrida is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to full sun exposure."
