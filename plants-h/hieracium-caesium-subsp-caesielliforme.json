It features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in clusters. The plant is characterized by its slender stem and small, elongated flower heads. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
