    "intro": "Hieracium burnatii subsp. tomentellum, commonly known as the tomentellum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its subspecies is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on the leaves and stems. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is of interest in botanical studies due to its specific ecological preferences."
