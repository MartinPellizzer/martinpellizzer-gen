    "intro": "Heteranthera lutea, commonly known as the yellow leaved water hyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a waxy surface. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers with three sepals and three petals. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the plant in water. Heteranthera lutea is often found in slow-moving or still freshwater habitats."
