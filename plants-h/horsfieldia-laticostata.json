    "intro": "Horsfieldia laticostata, commonly known as the broad-stemmed orchid, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its clustered, showy flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, tropical habitat. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the rich, organic soil of its natural environment. Horsfieldia laticostata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
