    "intro": "Hemionitis hosei, commonly known as the Japanese water fern, is a delicate aquatic fern native to East Asia. It thrives in shallow, still water environments and has finely divided, feather-like fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant's rhizomes spread along the substrate, anchoring it in place while absorbing nutrients from the water. It is often used in ornamental ponds and water gardens for its aesthetic appeal. Hemionitis hosei is also valued for its ability to improve water quality by filtering out impurities."
