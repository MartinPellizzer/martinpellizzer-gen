    "intro": "Hieracium immarginatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often reddish in color. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single inflorescence at the top of the stem, and it produces seeds in a fluffy pappus that aids in wind dispersal.
