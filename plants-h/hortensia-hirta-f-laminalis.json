    "intro": "Hortensia hirta f. laminalis, commonly known as the silverleaf hortensia, is a compact shrub native to the eastern United States. It features broad, ovate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers in shades of white to pale blue, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a suitable choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique foliage and modest floral display."
