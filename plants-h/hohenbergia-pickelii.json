    "intro": "Hohenbergia pickelii, commonly known as the silver rosette, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its compact, symmetrical rosette of narrow, silver-blue leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces inflorescences with vibrant red flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It prefers bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for indoor cultivation. Hohenbergia pickelii is prized for its ornamental appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
