    "intro": "Hypobathrum racemosum, commonly known as the clustered starwort, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
