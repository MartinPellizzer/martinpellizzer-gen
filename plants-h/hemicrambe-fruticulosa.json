    "intro": "Hemicrambe fruticulosa, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features wiry stems that spread along the ground, forming dense mats, and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hemicrambe fruticulosa is adapted to rocky and sandy soils, thriving in full sun and exhibiting drought tolerance."
