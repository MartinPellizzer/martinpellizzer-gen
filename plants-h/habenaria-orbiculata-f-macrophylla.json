    "intro": "Habenaria orbiculata f. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid species characterized by its robust, grass-like foliage. It features showy, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with prominent, spurred petals. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring shaded to semi-shaded conditions. Its roots are fibrous, and it often forms dense colonies in suitable environments. The morphological traits of this form, including its larger leaves and floral structure, distinguish it from the typical form of Habenaria orbiculata."
