    "intro": "Hieracium arrosiforme, commonly known as the water ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in wet or damp habitats, such as marshes and stream banks, and can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Although it is not widely cultivated, it plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
