    "intro": "Helichrysum squarrulosum, commonly known as the sticky helichrysum, is a perennial shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which are often used in dried flower arrangements. The plant has hairy, often sticky leaves that help reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Helichrysum squarrulosum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
