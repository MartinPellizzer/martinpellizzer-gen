    "intro": "Huperzia orizabae, commonly known as the Mexican clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its elongated, lance-shaped leaves that are often arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. This plant is native to the high-altitude regions of Mexico and parts of Central America. Huperzia orizabae produces sporangia on the underside of its leaves, which release spores for reproduction. It plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its native habitats, contributing to soil stability and providing microhabitats for other organisms."
