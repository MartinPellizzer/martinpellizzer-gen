    "intro": "Helianthemum barbatum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and North Africa. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant gardening."
