    "intro": "Heterospathe annectens, commonly known as the creeping marsh fern, is a species of fern native to wetland environments in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground and form dense mats. The plant features compound leaves with pinnate arrangement, and its fronds are typically elongated with a smooth, glossy surface. It thrives in moist, shaded areas and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of most fern species."
