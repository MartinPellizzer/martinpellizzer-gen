    "intro": "Hypericum hyssopifolium var. microcalycinum, commonly known as the small-fruited St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, glandular hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, capsule-like structures containing numerous tiny seeds. This variety is distinguished by its smaller flower size and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Hypericum hyssopifolium."
