    "intro": "Hoya whistleri, commonly known as the Whistler's hoya, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Asclepiadaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in humid, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a mild fragrance. Hoya whistleri is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in indoor settings."
