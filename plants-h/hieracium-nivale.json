    "intro": "Hieracium nivale, commonly known as the snow spear, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in cooler conditions. Hieracium nivale is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in the cooler, humid environments."
