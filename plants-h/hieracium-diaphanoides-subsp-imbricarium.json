    "intro": "Hieracium diaphanoides subsp. imbricarium, commonly known as the translucent hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant is distinguished by its finely divided, grass-like leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Due to its delicate appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many regions."
