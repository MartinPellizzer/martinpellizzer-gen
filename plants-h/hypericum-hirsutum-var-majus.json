It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy texture, which gives it its common name. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its medicinal properties have been historically used for their anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
