    "intro": "Hymenothrix glandulopubescens, commonly known as the hairy glandular fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hairy leaves that are covered in glandular trichomes, which secrete substances that may aid in moisture retention. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rock crevices. Its fronds are usually small and clustered, with a distinctive appearance that sets it apart from other fern species. Hymenothrix glandulopubescens is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it thrives in humid, temperate climates."
