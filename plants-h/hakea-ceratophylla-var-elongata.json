    "intro": "Hakea ceratophylla var. elongata, commonly known as the long-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical clusters of leaves that are typically green and somewhat leathery in texture. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are arranged in dense, cylindrical spikes. Its foliage is adapted to arid conditions, featuring thick, waxy leaves that reduce water loss. This species is often found in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to coastal and inland regions with low rainfall."
