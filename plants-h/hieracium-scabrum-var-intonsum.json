    "intro": "Hieracium scabrum var. intonsum, commonly known as rough hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features hairy, rough-textured leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
