    "intro": "Hemionitis nivea, commonly known as the snow fern, is a unique plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is a member of the Hemionitidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant thrives in cold, moist environments and is often found growing on rock surfaces or in shaded, rocky crevices. Its leaves are typically covered in a fine, white coating that helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hemionitis nivea is considered a rare and specialized plant with limited distribution."
