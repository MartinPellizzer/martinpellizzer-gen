    "intro": "Himatanthus revolutus, commonly known as the red-flowered poinsettia, is a tropical shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, velvety red bracts that surround small yellow flowers, which are actually the true flowers of the plant. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. The plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value, particularly during the holiday season."
