    "intro": "Haemanthus kalbreyeri, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a striking plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, spike-like clusters of bright red flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant produces long, narrow leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. The unique appearance of Haemanthus kalbreyeri makes it a standout addition to any garden with suitable conditions."
