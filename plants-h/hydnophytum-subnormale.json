    "intro": "Hydnophytum subnormale, commonly known as the climbing basket plant, is a tropical epiphytic species belonging to the Rubiaceae family. It is characterized by its unique morphology, featuring a woody stem with adventitious roots that allow it to climb and anchor itself to trees. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers that are often clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that disperses seeds through wind. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in the understory of tropical rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant or used in traditional medicine."
