    "intro": "Hieracium blyttianum subsp. cochleatiforme, commonly known as the spiral hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is known for its composite flower heads. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
