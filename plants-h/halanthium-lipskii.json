It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, appearing in clusters near the water surface. Halanthium lipskii plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and invertebrates."
