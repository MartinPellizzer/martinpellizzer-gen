    "intro": "Hieracium schultesii subsp. kiralymontis, commonly known as the Kiraly Mountains hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a single terminal head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and localized species within its range."
