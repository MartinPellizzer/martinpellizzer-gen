    "intro": "Holcus sorghum var. durra, commonly known as durra, is a robust grass species native to Africa and widely cultivated for its edible grains. It is characterized by its tall, sturdy stalks and dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, hard grains. The plant thrives in warm, arid climates and is highly drought-resistant, making it a staple crop in many regions. Its grains are rich in carbohydrates and are used to produce flour, porridge, and alcoholic beverages. The botanical features of durra make it an important resource for both food security and agricultural sustainability."
