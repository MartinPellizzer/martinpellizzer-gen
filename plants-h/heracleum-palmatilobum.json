    "intro": "Heracleum palmatilobum, commonly known as the broad-leaved cow parsley, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and showy white flowers. It is native to Central Asia and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant features a robust taproot system and can grow up to 2 meters in height, with large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are typically arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
