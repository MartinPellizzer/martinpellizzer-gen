    "intro": "Hieronyma moritziana var. yungasensis, commonly known as the Yungas hibiscus, is a shrub native to the humid montane forests of Bolivia and northern Argentina. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves with a velvety texture. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
