It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a woody stem and is covered in fine, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and mountainous regions. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is relatively drought-tolerant."
