    "intro": "Huperzia phlegmarioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, linear leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stem. The plant is found in moist, shaded environments, often in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves, typical of many ferns. Huperzia phlegmarioides is notable for its primitive morphology and is sometimes used in horticultural settings due to its ornamental value."
