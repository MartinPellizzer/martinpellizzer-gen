It is a low-growing, mat-forming plant with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in rocky, alpine environments and is adapted to harsh climatic conditions. Its botanical features make it well-suited for ecological restoration projects in its native habitat."
