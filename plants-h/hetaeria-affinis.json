    "intro": "Hetaeria affinis, commonly known as the common water fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to various regions in Asia. It thrives in freshwater environments such as ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams. The plant has slender, creeping rhizomes that help it spread across the water surface. Its fronds are delicate and often float on the water, with small, spore-producing structures called sori located on the underside. Hetaeria affinis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
