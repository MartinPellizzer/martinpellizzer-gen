It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, brightly colored flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, long-lasting bracts that give it its common name, often used in dried flower arrangements. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Helichrysum refractum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
