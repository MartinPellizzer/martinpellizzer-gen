    "intro": "Hieracium candelabrae, commonly known as the candlestick hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems that resemble a candlestick, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun. Hieracium candelabrae is a perennial species that can spread through rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions."
