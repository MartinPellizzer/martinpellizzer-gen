    "intro": "Hedera rhombea var. formosana, commonly known as the Formosan ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to Taiwan. It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a slightly waxy texture and a glossy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by red berries, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and as a ground cover in woodland settings."
