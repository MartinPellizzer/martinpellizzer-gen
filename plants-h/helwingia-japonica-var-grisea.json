It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine, grayish pubescence, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers in early spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and adaptability to temperate climates."
