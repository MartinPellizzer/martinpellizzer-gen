    "intro": "Hieracium peliophyllum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has basal leaves that are lanceolate and often covered in fine hairs, and it produces yellow flowers in early summer. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
