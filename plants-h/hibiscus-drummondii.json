    "intro": "Hibiscus drummondii, commonly known as Drummond's hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and are often adorned with a distinctive yellow or orange center. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and have a rough, hairy texture. Hibiscus drummondii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
