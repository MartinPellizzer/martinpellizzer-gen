    "intro": "Hedysarum multijugum f. albiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered sainfoin, is a horticultural form of the species Hedysarum multijugum. It is characterized by its pale to white flowers, which contrast with the typical yellow blooms of the species. This plant is a perennial legume, typically growing in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has trifoliate leaves and produces cylindrical seed pods that contain small, round seeds. The white-flowered form is prized in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
