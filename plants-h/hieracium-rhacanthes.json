It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it thrives in temperate climates. Its leaves are narrow and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disc-like structure. Hieracium rhacanthes is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
