    "intro": "Hypodematium humile, commonly known as the common hypodematium, is a small, herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces tiny, dry fruits called achenes. Hypodematium humile is generally short-lived and plays a minor role in local ecosystems."
