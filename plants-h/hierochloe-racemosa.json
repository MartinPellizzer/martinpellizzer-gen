    "intro": "Hierochloe racemosa, commonly known as slender needlegrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides, fields, and meadows. The plant has slender, wiry stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its inflorescence consists of a single, elongated spikelet that bears small, spikelet-like flowers. Hierochloe racemosa is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
