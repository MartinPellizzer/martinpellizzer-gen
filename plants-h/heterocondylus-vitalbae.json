    "intro": "Heterocondylus vitalbae, commonly known as the sheep's bread lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It forms a dense, greenish-gray crust on tree trunks and branches, often found in temperate regions. The thallus is composed of a symbiotic partnership between a photosynthetic algae and a fungal mycelium. It lacks distinct lobes but has a uniform, leathery texture. This lichen is an important indicator of air quality and ecological health in forest ecosystems."
