It is characterized by its dense, shrub-like growth habit and produces striking red or purple pea-like flowers. The plant has trifoliate leaves and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. It is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. The variety fruticosa is distinguished by its more compact and bushy form compared to the typical species."
