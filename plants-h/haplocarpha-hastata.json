    "intro": "Haplocarpha hastata, commonly known as the slenderleaf goldenweed, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in open areas such as prairies and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Haplocarpha hastata is a perennial herb that plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
