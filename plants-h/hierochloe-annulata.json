    "intro": "Hierochloe annulata, commonly known as the ringed bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, often forming dense mats on open, rocky soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Hierochloe annulata plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine environments."
