It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are alternate, rough to the touch, and have a serrated edge. The flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a yellowish color that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
