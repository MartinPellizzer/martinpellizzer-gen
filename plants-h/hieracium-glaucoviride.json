    "intro": "Hieracium glaucoviride, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, glaucous leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows and grasslands. The plant has a creeping growth habit and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive spread."
