    "intro": "Hieracium alatum subsp. canillosum, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions."
