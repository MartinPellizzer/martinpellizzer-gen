    "intro": "Hieracium villiferum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are rough and hairy, with a rosette formation, and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. Hieracium villiferum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
