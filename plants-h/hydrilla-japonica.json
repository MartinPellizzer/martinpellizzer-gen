    "intro": "Hydrilla japonica, commonly known as Japanese hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to East Asia. It has long, branching stems that can grow up to several meters in length, with small, whorled leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces tiny, yellowish flowers that are often submerged, followed by small, bladder-like fruits. It is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of water conditions, making it a common invasive species in freshwater ecosystems. Its rapid growth rate and ability to form dense mats can significantly impact water quality and aquatic life."
