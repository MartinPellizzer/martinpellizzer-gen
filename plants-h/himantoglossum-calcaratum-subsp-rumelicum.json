    "intro": "Himantoglossum calcaratum subsp. rumelicum, commonly known as the Alpine marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous areas, often in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces a single, showy, violet-blue flower with a distinctive, spurred lip. It has a short, fibrous root system and linear, grass-like leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
