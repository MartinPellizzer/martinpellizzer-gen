    "intro": "Hierochloe hirta subsp. arctica, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing perennial grass native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its fine, silky hairs that cover the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically forms dense mats or cushions, which help it withstand harsh environmental conditions. It thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Its small, spike-like inflorescence contains numerous tiny, wind-dispersed seeds."
