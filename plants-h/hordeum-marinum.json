    "intro": "Hordeum marinum, commonly known as sea barley, is a perennial grass native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dunes and tidal zones. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in tough, bract-like structures that aid in wind dispersal. Hordeum marinum plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
