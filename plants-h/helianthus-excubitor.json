    "intro": "Helianthus excubitor, commonly known as the watchman's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant produces bright yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Helianthus excubitor is often found in open areas such as grasslands and along roadsides, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
