    "intro": "Hypericum karjaginii, commonly known as Karjagin's St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit with woody stems. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, and its leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
