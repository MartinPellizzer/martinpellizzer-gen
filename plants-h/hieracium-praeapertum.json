    "intro": "Hieracium praeapertum, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many areas."
