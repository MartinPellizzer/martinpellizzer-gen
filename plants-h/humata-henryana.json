    "intro": "Humata henryana, commonly known as the Henry's humata, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family, characterized by its bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in cool, moist environments and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers, which bloom in late spring, are usually pale blue or white, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Humata henryana is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
