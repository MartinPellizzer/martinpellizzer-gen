    "intro": "Homeria collina var. miniata-minor, commonly known as the dwarf pink rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers with a distinctive red or purple hue on the dorsal sepal. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
