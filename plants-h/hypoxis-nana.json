    "intro": "Hypoxis nana, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces delicate yellow flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade. It is often found in rocky or open habitats, and it is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Hypoxis nana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
