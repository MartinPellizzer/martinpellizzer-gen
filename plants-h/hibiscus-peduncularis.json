It is characterized by its soft, hairy stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in summer and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. Hibiscus peduncularis is a herbaceous perennial that can reach heights of up to 6 feet, making it a notable presence in wetland ecosystems."
