    "intro": "Hieracium fallax var. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a distinctive whitish or bluish-gray pubescence. Its flowering stems rise above the foliage, bearing clusters of small, yellowish to orange-red flowers. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its drought tolerance and overall hardiness."
