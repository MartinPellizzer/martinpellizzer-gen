    "intro": "Hieracium collinum subsp. altaicum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and open, sunny environments. It has a low-growing habit with hairy stems and is often found in meadows and rocky areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
