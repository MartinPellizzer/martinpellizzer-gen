It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. It is an annual or biennial plant that can spread rapidly through its rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a subject of ecological study."
