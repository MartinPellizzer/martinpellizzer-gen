    "intro": "Helenium intermedium, commonly known as the intermediate sneezeweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and showy yellow to orange ray flowers. The plant typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. Helenium intermedium produces small, tubular disk flowers that are often overlooked but play a role in pollination by insects. Its foliage is usually narrow and grass-like, with a distinct aromatic scent when crushed."
