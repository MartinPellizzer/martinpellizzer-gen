    "intro": "Hieracium rigescoides, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a cluster of small flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium rigescoides is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
