    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. parciflocciforme, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head. The subspecies parciflocciforme is distinguished by its dense, floccose (downy) floral involucres and shorter, more compact inflorescences. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
