    "intro": "Hieracium anaspilotum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are linear to lanceolate, often with a hairy surface, and its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium anaspilotum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
