    "intro": "Helianthus pauciflorus subsp. pauciflorus, commonly known as the few-flowered sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring sturdy stems and large, yellow, daisy-like flowers. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and is characterized by its sparse flowering habit, producing only a few blooms per stem. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often found in open woods and prairies. Its botanical structure supports its role as a nectar source for pollinators and contributes to its ecological significance in native habitats."
