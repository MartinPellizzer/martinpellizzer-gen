    "intro": "Harrisia regelii, commonly known as the giant night-blooming cactus, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its thick, ribbed stems and spiny areoles. The plant produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its flowers are followed by fleshy, red berries that are edible for both humans and animals. Harrisia regelii is adapted to arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water."
