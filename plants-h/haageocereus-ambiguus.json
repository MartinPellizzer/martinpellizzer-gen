    "intro": "Haageocereus ambiguus, commonly known as the night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems and is known for its striking white flowers that open at night. The plant has spiny areoles and produces small, woolly fruits that are edible. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil and minimal water. Its nocturnal flowering habit makes it a popular choice for desert gardens and botanical collections."
