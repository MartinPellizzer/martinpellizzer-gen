    "intro": "Hieracium lamprophyllum subsp. cantabricum, commonly known as the Cantabrian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flower heads and more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic plant in its native range."
