    "intro": "Hedysarum sessiliflorum, commonly known as the sessile-flower milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its root system is fibrous and often forms dense colonies, which can help stabilize soil in rocky or disturbed habitats. Hedysarum sessiliflorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential health benefits."
