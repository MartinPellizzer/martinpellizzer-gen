    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pseudofritschii, commonly known as the false meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, and it is often found in temperate regions. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is relatively uncommon and can be difficult to distinguish from closely related species."
