    "intro": "Hedyotis verticillaris subsp. plantaginifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features opposite, linear to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy, and small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters. Its root system is fibrous, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
