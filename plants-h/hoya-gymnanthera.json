    "intro": "Hoya gymnanthera, commonly known as the silver queen hoya, is a tropical epiphytic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that are often variegated with silver and green patterns. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pink in color. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya gymnanthera is popular as a houseplant due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
