    "intro": "Hieracium paraguayense, commonly known as Paraguay hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in grasslands and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium paraguayense is often considered an invasive species in regions outside its native range due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
