    "intro": "Higginsia macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf higginsia, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Higginsia macrophylla thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, which extends from late spring to early autumn."
