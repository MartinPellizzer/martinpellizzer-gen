    "intro": "Halocharis syriaca, commonly known as the Syrian halocharis, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its narrow, evergreen leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and long blooming period, typically from spring to early summer. Halocharis syriaca is also valued for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
