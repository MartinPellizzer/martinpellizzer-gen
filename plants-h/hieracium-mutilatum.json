    "intro": "Hieracium mutilatum, commonly known as the ragged hornet's nest, is a species of flowering plant in the daisy family, Asteraceae. It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its rough, hairy leaves and pale yellow to brownish flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its flowers are usually clustered in a single head, and the plant can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Hieracium mutilatum is often considered a weed but has ecological value by supporting pollinators and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
