    "intro": "Hieracium clovense var. stenolepiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a hairy texture, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
