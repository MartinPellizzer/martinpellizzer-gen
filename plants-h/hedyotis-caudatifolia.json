    "intro": "Hedyotis caudatifolia, commonly known as the long-tailed sprout or Indian pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and have a glossy, dark green appearance. Small white flowers are borne in clusters, and the plant produces small, round berries that are edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
