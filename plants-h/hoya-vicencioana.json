    "intro": "Hoya vicencioana, commonly known as the \"Vicente's Waxplant,\" is a species of flowering plant native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Apocynaceae and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of star-shaped flowers. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they emit a subtle fragrance. Hoya vicencioana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to care for in suitable growing conditions."
