    "intro": "Hariota cribrata, commonly known as the nettleleaf mallow, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are often covered with stinging hairs similar to those of nettles. Hariota cribrata is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and thrives in rich, loamy soil."
