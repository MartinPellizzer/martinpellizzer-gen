    "intro": "Haemadictyon schizadenium, commonly known as the split-leaf waterwheel, is a perennial aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features striking, spirally arranged leaves that are deeply lobed and often have a reddish or purple hue. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically in clusters at the water's surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Haemadictyon schizadenium is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
