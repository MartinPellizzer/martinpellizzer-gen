    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. similifolium, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and bears yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by phyllaries. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its stems are usually hairy as well. This subspecies is characterized by its similar leaf morphology to other hawkweed species, which aids in its identification."
