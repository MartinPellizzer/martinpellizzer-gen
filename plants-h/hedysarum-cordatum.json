    "intro": "Hedysarum cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf sweetclover, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are heart-shaped and have a distinctive dark green color. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hedysarum cordatum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
