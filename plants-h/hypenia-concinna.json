    "intro": "Hypenia concinna, commonly known as the narrowleaf hypenia, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features slender, upright stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters during the spring, and it produces small, oval fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hypenia concinna is valued for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and its ornamental appeal in shaded garden settings."
