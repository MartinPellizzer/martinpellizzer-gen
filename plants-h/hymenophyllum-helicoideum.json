    "intro": "Hymenophyllum helicoideum, commonly known as the spiral fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of the Pacific. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, spiral-shaped fronds that curl tightly around its stem. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface, which helps reduce water loss in its moist habitat. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its unique reproductive strategy."
