    "intro": "Hedyotis laciniata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender stems and small, opposite leaves that are often deeply lobed. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors or stream banks. Hedyotis laciniata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine in some regions."
