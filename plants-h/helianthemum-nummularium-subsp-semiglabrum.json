    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium subsp. semiglabrum, commonly known as the silver carpet cushionplant, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, mat-forming growth with fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a silvery-white coating of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the summer months, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its compact form and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
