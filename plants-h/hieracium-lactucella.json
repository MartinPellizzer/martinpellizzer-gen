It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and is characterized by its distinctive purple flowers and spiny leaves. The plant contains a milky sap, which is a key feature in its common name. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in a composite head.
