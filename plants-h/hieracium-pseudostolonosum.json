    "intro": "Hieracium pseudostolonosum, commonly known as the false hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that help in spreading vegetatively. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
