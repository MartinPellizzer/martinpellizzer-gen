    "intro": "Hydrophyllum, commonly known as waterleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are typically found in moist or wet environments, such as marshes, stream banks, and wet meadows. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of leaves and showy, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to purple. The genus includes several species, many of which are native to North America. Hydrophyllum species often play a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various insects and small animals."
