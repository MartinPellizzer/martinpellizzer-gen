    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. glabriligulatum, commonly known as the smooth-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and stems, which lack the hairy texture found in other hawkweed species. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, contributing to its role in local pollinator ecosystems."
