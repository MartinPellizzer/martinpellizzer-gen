It features opposite, heart-shaped leaves that are usually covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is fibrous and can become invasive, making it a common weed in agricultural areas. The plant is also known for its ability to thrive in disturbed soils and humid environments."
