    "intro": "Hieracium andrasovszkyi subsp. cremnophilum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Carpathian Mountains. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing on slopes and cliffs at high altitudes. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. It is adapted to harsh conditions with a deep root system and hairy foliage to reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological significance and unique morphology."
