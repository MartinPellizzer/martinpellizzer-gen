    "intro": "Hedyotis foetida, commonly known as the stinkweed, is a perennial herb native to Asia and parts of Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white or greenish flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed berries. Hedyotis foetida is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is most noticeable when the plant is crushed."
