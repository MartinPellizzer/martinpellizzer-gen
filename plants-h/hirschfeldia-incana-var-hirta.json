    "intro": "Hirschfeldia incana var. hirta, commonly known as the woolly hirschfeldia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the cold climates of the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and segmented stems. The plant is distinguished by its dense, woolly covering of white hairs, which helps insulate it against harsh winter conditions. It typically thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in tundra and alpine habitats. Due to its unique adaptations, it plays a role in stabilizing soil in extreme environments."
