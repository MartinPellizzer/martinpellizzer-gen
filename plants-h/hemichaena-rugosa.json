It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or swampy habitats.
