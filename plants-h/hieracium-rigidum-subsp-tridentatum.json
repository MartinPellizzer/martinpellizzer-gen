    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. tridentatum, commonly known as the three-toothed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. The plant features upright stems with rough, hairy surfaces and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have three distinct teeth. Its flowers are yellow and occur in clusters, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the disk florets. The species is characterized by its robust growth and distinctive leaf morphology, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
