    "intro": "Hieracium onosmoides subsp. orthoglossum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. The leaves are typically alternate, with a rough, hairy texture, and the stems are often reddish in color. It thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. This subspecies is closely related to other hawkweed species but can be distinguished by its specific morphological features."
