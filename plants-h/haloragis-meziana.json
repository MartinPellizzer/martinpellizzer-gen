    "intro": "Haloragis meziana, commonly known as the coastal wallaby's foot, is a flowering plant native to southern Australia. It is a low-growing herb with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming from late winter to early spring. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along coastal areas and is often found in dunes or rocky outcrops. Its ability to tolerate salt spray and drought makes it well adapted to harsh maritime conditions."
