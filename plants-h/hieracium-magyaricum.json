It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow-orange flower heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disc shape, surrounded by pale green to brown bracts. Hieracium magyaricum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed due to its aggressive growth habit."
