    "intro": "Hieracium patens subsp. pseuderiophorum, commonly known as the slender spearthistle, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright, sparsely haired stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is native to Europe and is often found in dry, disturbed soils such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for various pollinators."
