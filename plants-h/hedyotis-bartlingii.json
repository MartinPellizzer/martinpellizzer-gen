    "intro": "Hedyotis bartlingii, commonly known as the creeping jewelweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and the Americas. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow-orange flowers that are clustered in cymes, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Hedyotis bartlingii is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
