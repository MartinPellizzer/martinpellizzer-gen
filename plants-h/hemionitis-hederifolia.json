    "intro": "Hemionitis hederifolia, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Asia and the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Botanically, it is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit and its ability to spread vegetatively through underground stems."
