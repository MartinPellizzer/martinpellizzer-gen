    "intro": "Hydnophytum formicarum subsp. blumei, commonly known as the ant plant, is a climbing shrub native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique leaf structure, which forms a hollow, cup-like cavity at the base of the leaf blade. This cavity serves as a habitat for ants, which in turn provide protection against herbivores and help with nutrient cycling. The plant relies on its symbiotic relationship with ants for survival, as the ants defend it from pests and assist in seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies of mutualistic relationships."
