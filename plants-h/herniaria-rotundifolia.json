    "intro": "Herniaria rotundifolia, commonly known as roundleaf sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It typically thrives in dry, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal areas and disturbed habitats. The plant features small, round, fleshy leaves that are clustered at the base, and it produces tiny white or pale pink flowers during the spring and summer months. Its compact growth habit and ability to tolerate harsh conditions make it a hardy species adapted to arid environments. Herniaria rotundifolia is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally in herbal remedies."
