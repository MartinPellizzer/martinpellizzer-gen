    "intro": "Hieracium purpurascens subsp. cabreranum, commonly known as the Canary Island hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Canary Islands. It features basal rosettes of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. The plant is characterized by its erect stem and is often found in disturbed soils and rocky habitats. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread aggressively. Botanically, it is notable for its ability to hybridize with other hawkweed species, contributing to its ecological impact."
