    "intro": "Hedysarum songaricum var. montanum, commonly known as the mountain milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with three oval-shaped leaflets and has a fibrous root system that helps it thrive in poor, rocky soils. It is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
