    "intro": "Herniaria oranensis subsp. subglabrifolia, commonly known as the smooth-leaved sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, though the subspecies subglabrifolia has a smoother texture. The plant produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments. Due to its compact growth habit and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
