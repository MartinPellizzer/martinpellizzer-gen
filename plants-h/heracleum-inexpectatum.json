It is a tall herbaceous plant that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the carrot family. Its stems are hollow and covered in fine hairs, and the leaves are often bluish-green in color. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
