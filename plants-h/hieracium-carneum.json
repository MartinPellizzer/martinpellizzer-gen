It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features rosettes of fleshy, reddish-green leaves and produces yellow flowers with ray florets. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
