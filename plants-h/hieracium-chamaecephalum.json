    "intro": "Hieracium chamaecephalum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous flowering heads. The plant features basal leaves that are typically lobed or divided, and its flowers are small, yellowish, and clustered in composite inflorescences. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
