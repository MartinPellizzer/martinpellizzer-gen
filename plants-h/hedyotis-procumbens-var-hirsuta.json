It features creeping stolons that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a hairy surface, giving it a distinctive texture. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices."
