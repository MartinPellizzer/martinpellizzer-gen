    "intro": "Hieracium leviforme, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. Hieracium leviforme is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
