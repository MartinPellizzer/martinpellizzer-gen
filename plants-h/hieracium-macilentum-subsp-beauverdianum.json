    "intro": "Hieracium macilentum subsp. beauverdianum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils. The plant features upright, slender stems that are often hairy, with basal leaves that are linear to lanceolate in shape. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, and are borne on long, slender peduncles. This subspecies is characterized by its relatively small size and distinctive leaf morphology, making it easily identifiable within the Hieracium genus."
