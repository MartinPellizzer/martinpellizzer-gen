    "intro": "Helonias minuta, commonly known as the small-flowered marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in the southeastern United States. It is a small, herbaceous plant with a short, erect stem that bears a single, delicate flower. The flower has a greenish-white color with a distinctive, elongated lip that is often darker in hue. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, which aid in nutrient absorption. This plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in cypress swamps and pine flatwoods."
