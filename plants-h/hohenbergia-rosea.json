    "intro": "Hohenbergia rosea, commonly known as the pink hohenbergia, is a flowering plant native to Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of white or pinkish hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that can range in color from pink to red, adding visual interest to its foliage. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hohenbergia rosea is popular among succulent and bromeliad enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
