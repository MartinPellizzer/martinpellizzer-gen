It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The leaves are typically narrow and often have three distinct lobes, giving it the subspecies name *subtridentatum*. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
