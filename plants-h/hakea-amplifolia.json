    "intro": "Hakea amplifolia, commonly known as the broadleaf hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and pairs of opposite, broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces striking, cone-like inflorescences that bear bright red or orange flowers, which attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it suitable for coastal and dryland environments. Hakea amplifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in native gardens."
