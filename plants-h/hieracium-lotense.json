It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while its stems are upright and somewhat fibrous. Hieracium lotense is often found in Europe and parts of Asia, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
