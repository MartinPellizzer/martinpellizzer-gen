    "intro": "Hypolepis cubensis, commonly known as the Cuban water fern, is a member of the Dryopteridaceae family. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, bi-pinnate fronds that are typically 20\u201330 cm in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, allowing it to store water and nutrients. Hypolepis cubensis is notable for its ability to tolerate waterlogged soils, making it a common species in wetlands and along stream banks."
