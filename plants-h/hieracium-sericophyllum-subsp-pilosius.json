    "intro": "Hieracium sericophyllum subsp. pilosius, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a soft, velvety appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
