    "intro": "Hydriastele simbiakii, commonly known as the Bornean ghost orchid, is a rare epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent leaves and its unique, orchid-like flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires specific conditions to flourish. It is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator of undisturbed tropical ecosystems."
