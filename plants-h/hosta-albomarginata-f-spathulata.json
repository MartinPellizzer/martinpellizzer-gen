    "intro": "Hosta albomarginata f. spathulata, commonly known as the broad-leafed white-edged hosta, is a cultivar prized for its striking foliage. It features broad, waxy leaves with a bright white margin contrasting with deep green centers. The plant produces fragrant, lantern-shaped flowers in late summer, adding ornamental value beyond its foliage. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This variety is relatively low maintenance and resistant to common hosta pests, making it a popular choice among gardeners."
