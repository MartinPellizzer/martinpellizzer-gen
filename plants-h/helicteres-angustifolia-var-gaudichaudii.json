    "intro": "Helicteres angustifolia var. gaudichaudii, commonly known as the narrow-leaf snakeroot, is a perennial shrub native to tropical regions of the Americas. It features slender, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy beneath, and it produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant is characterized by its unique, branched inflorescences and is often found in moist, shaded habitats. It has been used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that the plant contains toxic compounds and should be handled with care."
