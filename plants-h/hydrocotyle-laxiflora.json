    "intro": "Hydrocotyle laxiflora, commonly known as the broadleaf water shield, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in the Americas. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are divided into lobes, allowing it to spread across the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early autumn. Its rhizomes help anchor it in shallow water, while its buoyant leaves aid in photosynthesis. Hydrocotyle laxiflora plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic biodiversity."
