    "intro": "Hieracium crepidispermum f. majoriceps, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a variant of the hawkweed genus characterized by its robust growth and distinctive floral structure. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with serrated margins, and its flowering stems bear numerous yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters. The inflorescence is typically more elongated and robust compared to other hawkweed species, giving it its common name. It is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions."
