    "intro": "Habenaria inconspicua, commonly known as the common ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Africa, including South Africa and Madagascar. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and grasslands. The plant features a slender, upright stem with a single or few leaves and a spike of small, white or pale green flowers. Its flowers are often overlooked due to their inconspicuous appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name. The species is characterized by its delicate structure and preference for well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
