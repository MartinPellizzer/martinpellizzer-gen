    "intro": "Haplopappus squarrosus var. stenolepis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on wiry, branching stems. Its root system is extensive and deep, allowing it to access moisture from deeper soil layers. This species is well adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils."
