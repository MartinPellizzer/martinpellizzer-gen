    "intro": "Hydrocotyle setulosa, commonly known as the hairy pennywort, is a low-growing aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, rounded leaves that are often covered in fine, hair-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically produces small, white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in moist environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands, where it can spread rapidly through its stolons. Hydrocotyle setulosa is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and ease of cultivation."
