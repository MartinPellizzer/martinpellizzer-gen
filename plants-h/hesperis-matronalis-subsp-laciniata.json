    "intro": "Hesperis matronalis subsp. laciniata, commonly known as the cut-leaved white campion, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed or cut, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long flowering period and ability to attract pollinators."
