    "intro": "Hordeum pensanum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved barley, is a species of grass native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical spikelets and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found in association with other grasses. Hordeum pensanum is not cultivated for food but is of interest in botanical studies due to its ecological role and morphological features."
