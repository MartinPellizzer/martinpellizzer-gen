    "intro": "Hieracium benzianum subsp. microvulgatum, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are usually spiny and arranged in a rosette, while the flowers are yellow and occur in dense clusters. It is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
