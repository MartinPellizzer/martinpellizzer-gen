It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are alternate, rough, and often covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a single head.
