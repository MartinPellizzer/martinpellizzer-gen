It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its clusters of small, fleshy berries that turn a striking purple or blue-black color when mature. The plant typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and features opposite, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The berries are also used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
