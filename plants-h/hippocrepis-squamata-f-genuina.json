    "intro": "Hippocrepis squamata f. genuina, commonly known as the Alpine scabious, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features narrow, hairy leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh mountain conditions. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude meadows and scree slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
