    "intro": "Haworthia reinwardtii var. fallax, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or yellow during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
