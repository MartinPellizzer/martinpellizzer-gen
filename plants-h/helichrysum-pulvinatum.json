    "intro": "Helichrysum pulvinatum, commonly known as the golden bush, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after flowering, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its native arid environment. Helichrysum pulvinatum is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
