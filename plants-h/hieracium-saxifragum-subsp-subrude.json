    "intro": "Hieracium saxifragum subsp. subrude, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in alpine meadows and tundra environments. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle differences in morphology compared to other Hieracium species. It is adapted to cold climates and has a relatively short growing season."
