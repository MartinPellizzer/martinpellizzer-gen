    "intro": "Harpalyce crepidinea, commonly known as the narrowleaf harpalyce, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by narrow, elongated pods. Harpalyce crepidinea is typically found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It plays a minor role in local ecosystems but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences."
