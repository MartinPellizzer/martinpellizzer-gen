    "intro": "Hoffmannseggia viscosa var. egena, commonly known as the sticky hoffmannseggia, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs that give it a sticky texture and help reduce water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and low rainfall. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and arranged in a compact rosette pattern. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, often greenish-yellow in color, and appear in clusters during the warmer months."
