    "intro": "Helietta multiflora, commonly known as the Florida starflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive star-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in a star pattern. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Helietta multiflora plays an important role in its native ecosystem, providing nectar for pollinators and habitat for various invertebrates."
