It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that bloom in late summer, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
