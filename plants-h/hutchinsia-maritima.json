    "intro": "Hutchinsia maritima, commonly known as the coastal hutchinsia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small, herbaceous shrub that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shoreline. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in its arid coastal environment. Hutchinsia maritima is well-suited to salt spray and can tolerate moderate levels of coastal wind."
