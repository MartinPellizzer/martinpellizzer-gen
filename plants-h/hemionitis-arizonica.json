    "intro": "Hemionitis arizonica, commonly known as Arizona hairpencil, is a small, delicate herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in clusters along the leaf margins. It thrives in arid environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Hemionitis arizonica is often found in rocky soils and is a rare species with limited geographic distribution."
