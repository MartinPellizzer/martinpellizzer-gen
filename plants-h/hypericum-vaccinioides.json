    "intro": "Hypericum vaccinioides, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian region of the United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves that are densely packed along its stems. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and prefers partial to full sun. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is often used in native plant gardens and as a ground cover."
