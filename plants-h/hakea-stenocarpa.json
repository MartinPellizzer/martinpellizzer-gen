    "intro": "Hakea stenocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-fruited hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces striking, cone-shaped inflorescences that bear small, pink to purple flowers. These flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly honeyeaters, due to their nectar-rich nature. Hakea stenocarpa is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that allow it to thrive in poor soils."
