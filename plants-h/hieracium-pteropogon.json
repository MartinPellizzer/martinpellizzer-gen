    "intro": "Hieracium pteropogon, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow with a central disk, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium pteropogon is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
