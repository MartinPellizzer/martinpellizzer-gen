    "intro": "Hieracium topicum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides, preferring moist to moderately dry soils. It produces yellow-orange flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium topicum is often found in disturbed habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
