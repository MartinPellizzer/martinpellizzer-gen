It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems that bear clusters of fragrant, violet-blue flowers. The plant produces oval, fleshy bulbs that store nutrients, enabling it to survive in dry periods. Its leaves are strap-shaped and form a dense rosette at the base.
