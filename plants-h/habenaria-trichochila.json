    "intro": "Habenaria trichochila, commonly known as the hairy-leaf orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, greenish-white flowers. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with mycorrhizal fungi, aiding in nutrient absorption. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
