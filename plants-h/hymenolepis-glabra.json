    "intro": "Hymenolepis glabra, commonly known as the smooth liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Marchantiaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid body composed of a flattened, ribbon-like structure called a thallus. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having specialized structures for absorption and reproduction. Hymenolepis glabra reproduces both sexually through spores and asexually through gemmae, which are small, vegetative propagules."
