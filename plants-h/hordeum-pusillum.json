    "intro": "Hordeum pusillum, commonly known as dwarf barley, is a small annual grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 10\u201330 cm and has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow leaves. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that contain both sterile and fertile florets. Its seeds are enclosed in tough, straw-like glumes, which aid in seed dispersal. Hordeum pusillum is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in agricultural settings."
