    "intro": "Hieracium umbricoliforme, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often hairy, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Hieracium umbricoliforme is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
