    "intro": "Haemospermum moluccanum, commonly known as the bloodflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking red-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often hairy. It is known for its unique seed pods that split open when mature, dispersing seeds through a mechanism called explosive dehiscence. Haemospermum moluccanum is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its vibrant floral display."
