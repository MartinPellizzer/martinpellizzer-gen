    "intro": "Hildmannia aspillagae, commonly known as the Mexican star-of-Bahia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in humid, shaded environments. Its small, white to yellowish flowers bloom in clusters, and the plant is noted for its delicate, hairy foliage. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hildmannia aspillagae is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
