    "intro": "Helianthemum vulgare var. hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a fuzzy appearance, and its small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in sunny, well-drained habitats. It is a hardy species that is drought-tolerant and well-suited to Mediterranean climates. The woolly rockrose is also known for its aromatic leaves and is sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
