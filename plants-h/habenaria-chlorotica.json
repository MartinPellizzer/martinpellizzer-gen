    "intro": "Habenaria chlorotica, commonly known as the green orchid, is a species of orchid native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are elongated and often have a waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Habenaria chlorotica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
