It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant features slender, erect stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white to pale blue flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits. Hypolaena gracilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
