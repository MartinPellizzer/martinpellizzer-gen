    "intro": "Hemarthria fasciculata subsp. altissima, commonly known as tall flatsedge, is a grass-like plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wet or seasonally flooded habitats, such as marshes and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and often have a bluish-green color, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
