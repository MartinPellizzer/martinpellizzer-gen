    "intro": "Hypericum repens var. majus, commonly known as the greater trailing St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
