    "intro": "Hemionitis crenata, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high altitudes of Asia. It belongs to the family Pteridaceae and is characterized by its fern-like, pinnately compound leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool and moist conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Hemionitis crenata is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage."
