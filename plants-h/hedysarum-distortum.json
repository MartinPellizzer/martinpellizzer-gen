It is characterized by its twining stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically green with a hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Hedysarum distortum is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
