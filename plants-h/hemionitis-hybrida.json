    "intro": "Hemionitis hybrida, commonly known as the hybrid hemionitis, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of China. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are often described as resembling the leaves of the common water fern. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemionitis hybrida is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
