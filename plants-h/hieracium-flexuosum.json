    "intro": "Hieracium flexuosum, commonly known as the bent-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish composite flowers that bloom in summer, attracting various pollinators. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped and may have a wavy or curled margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium flexuosum is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats across Europe and parts of Asia."
