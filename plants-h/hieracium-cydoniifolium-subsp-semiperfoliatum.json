    "intro": "Hieracium cydoniifolium subsp. semiperfoliatum, commonly known as the sand sandwort or sand thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in open habitats such as dunes or coastal areas. The plant features hairy stems and leaves that are often semi-perfoliate, meaning they partially encircle the stem. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in composite heads, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often found in disturbed or arid environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions."
