    "intro": "Hydrobryum koribanum, commonly known as the Koribana water moss, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes, where it anchors itself to submerged surfaces. The plant has thin, ribbon-like leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in width, allowing it to absorb nutrients efficiently from the water. Its reproductive structures are small and inconspicuous, relying on water currents for spore dispersal. Due to its limited habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
