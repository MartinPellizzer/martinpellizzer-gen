The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are evergreen, glossy, and elliptical in shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. Henrya longipes is well-suited for rock gardens and shaded areas due to its preference for moist, well-drained soil."
