    "intro": "Helianthemum declinatum, commonly known as the creeping sandmat, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in dense, rounded inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
