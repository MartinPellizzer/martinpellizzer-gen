    "intro": "Hieracium angustifolium var. stoloniferum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to colonize open areas. This species is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators."
