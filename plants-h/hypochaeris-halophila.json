    "intro": "Hypochaeris halophila, commonly known as saltgrass, is a flowering plant native to arid and coastal regions. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and small, yellow composite flowers. The plant has hairy stems and leaves adapted to withstand saline and drought conditions. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in salt marshes and coastal dunes. Hypochaeris halophila plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
