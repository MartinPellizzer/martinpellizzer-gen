It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland habitats and has lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture. Its stems are often covered in stiff, bristly hairs, which contribute to its common name. Houstonia acerosa is a short-lived perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
