    "intro": "Hieracium pseudopilosella subsp. albarracina, commonly known as the white-hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green leaves and daisy-like flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale, almost white flower heads, which set it apart from other members of the Hieracium genus. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
