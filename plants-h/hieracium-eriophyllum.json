    "intro": "Hieracium eriophyllum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It features basal leaves that are narrow and grass-like, with a flowering stem that bears a single, showy yellow flower head. Hieracium eriophyllum is often considered a weed due to its ability to spread rapidly and colonize new areas."
