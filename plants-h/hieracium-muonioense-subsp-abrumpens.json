    "intro": "Hieracium muonioense subsp. abrumpens, commonly known as the Muonio hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to northern Finland and parts of Scandinavia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces yellow disk flowers with ray florets, typical of the genus Hieracium. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in boreal forest edges and wet meadows. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
