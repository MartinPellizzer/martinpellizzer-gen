    "intro": "Heleniastrum amphibolum, commonly known as the water helenia, is a rare aquatic plant found in freshwater environments. It has finely divided, ribbon-like leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight efficiently. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its roots are adapted to anchor in muddy or sandy substrates. Heleniastrum amphibolum plays a vital role in maintaining water quality by filtering impurities and providing habitat for aquatic life."
