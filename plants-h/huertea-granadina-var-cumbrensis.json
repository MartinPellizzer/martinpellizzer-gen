    "intro": "Huertea granadina var. cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbre hill huertea, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in Colombia. It is characterized by its erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, dense hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a temperate climate with moderate precipitation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
