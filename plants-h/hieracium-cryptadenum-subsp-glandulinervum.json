    "intro": "Hieracium cryptadenum subsp. glandulinervum, commonly known as the glandular-veined hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are hairy and have distinct glandular veins, which are a key identifying feature. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months, contributing to its role in pollinator habitats."
