    "intro": "Heliotropium calcicola, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with hairy stems and small, violet or purple flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand high temperatures and limited water availability. Its leaves are typically narrow and grayish-green, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Heliotropium calcicola plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
