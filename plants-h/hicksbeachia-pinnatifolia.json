It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy leaves that are pinnately lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal conditions with high salinity and strong winds. Hicksbeachia pinnatifolia is often used in coastal landscaping due to its ornamental value and hardiness."
