    "intro": "Hieracium fagineum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and grasslands. The plant is often found in open habitats and can spread vegetatively through its rhizomes. Its botanical features make it a common indicator species in early successional plant communities."
