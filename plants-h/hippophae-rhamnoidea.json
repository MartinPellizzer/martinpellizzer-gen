It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellow flowers in the spring. It thrives in sandy or loamy soils and is often found in coastal areas or along riverbanks. Its hardy nature makes it useful for erosion control and as a source of medicinal and nutritional compounds."
