    "intro": "Hieracium bupleuroides subsp. calycinum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish to orange flowers arranged in a composite inflorescence, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils at high altitudes, often forming dense mats in open habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
