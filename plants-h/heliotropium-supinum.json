It is a low-growing herb with sprawling stems that often lie close to the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically violet or pink in color. Its leaves are usually opposite and oval-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Heliotropium supinum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in coastal areas due to its salt tolerance."
