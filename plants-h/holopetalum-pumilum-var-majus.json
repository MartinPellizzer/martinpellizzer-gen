    "intro": "Holopetalum pumilum var. majus, commonly known as the dwarf snowbell, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
