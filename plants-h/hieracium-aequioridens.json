    "intro": "Hieracium aequioridens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
