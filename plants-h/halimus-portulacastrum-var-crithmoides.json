    "intro": "Halimus portulacastrum var. crithmoides, commonly known as the Mediterranean sand verbena, is a low-growing, succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal areas and dry plains. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a hardy plant suitable for xeriscaping and coastal gardens."
