    "intro": "Hieracium hoidalicum, commonly known as the Hoidali hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and agricultural fields. It has basal leaves that are often hairy and can reach up to 20 cm in length, with yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Hieracium hoidalicum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize various environments."
