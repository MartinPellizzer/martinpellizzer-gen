    "intro": "Hieracium stenopithodes, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium stenopithodes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
