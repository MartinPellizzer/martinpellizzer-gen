    "intro": "Hieracium mulgedium, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions but also serves as a food source for various pollinators."
