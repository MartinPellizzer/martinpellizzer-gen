    "intro": "Heracantha cretica, commonly known as the Cretan Heracantha, is a rare and elusive plant native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, aromatic stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, limestone-rich soils and is adapted to the Mediterranean climate. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a mild, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
