    "intro": "Huperzia goebelii, commonly known as the Goebel's spikemoss, is a species of fern ally native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Huperziaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and spore-producing cones. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually elongated and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture. Huperzia goebelii plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for small invertebrates in its native ecosystems."
