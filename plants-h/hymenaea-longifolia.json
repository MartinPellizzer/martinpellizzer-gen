    "intro": "Hymenaea longifolia, commonly known as the Brazil nut tree, is a large, tropical tree native to the Amazon Basin. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and compound leaves with long, slender leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by woody pods containing edible seeds, known as Brazil nuts. These nuts are rich in nutrients, particularly selenium and protein, and are highly valued in global markets. The plant plays a significant ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
