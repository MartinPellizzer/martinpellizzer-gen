    "intro": "Hierochloe dregei, commonly known as the Mongolian needlegrass, is a perennial grass native to the temperate regions of Asia, particularly Mongolia and parts of China. It typically grows in open, dry grasslands and steppes, where it forms dense, low-growing tufts. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive blue-green hue, and its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often clustered in small, compact panicles. Hierochloe dregei is well adapted to arid conditions, with deep root systems that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological role includes stabilizing soil and providing forage for grazing animals in its native habitats."
