    "intro": "Hieracium phlomoides subsp. phlomoidiforme, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has a creeping growth habit with a fibrous root system, allowing it to spread and colonize new areas effectively. Due to its aggressive growth, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
