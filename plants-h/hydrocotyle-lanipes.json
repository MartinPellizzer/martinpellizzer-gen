    "intro": "Hydrocotyle lanipes, commonly known as the velvetleaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, velvety leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as swamps and wetlands. It produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels. Hydrocotyle lanipes is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a useful wetland plant and a potential invasive species in some areas."
