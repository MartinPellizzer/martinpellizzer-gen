    "intro": "Heliconia spiralis var. anchicayana, commonly known as the Anchicayana heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Andes region of South America. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped inflorescence composed of bright red bracts that enclose numerous small, yellow flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, with a waxy texture that helps it retain moisture. This variant is prized for its ornamental value and is commonly cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
