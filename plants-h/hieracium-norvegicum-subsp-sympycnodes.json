It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along riverbanks. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
