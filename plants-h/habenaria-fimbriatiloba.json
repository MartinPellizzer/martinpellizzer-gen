    "intro": "Habenaria fimbriatiloba, commonly known as the fringed-lobed orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and marshy areas. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with a rhizome that produces a cluster of leaves and flower spikes. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with distinctive fringed petals and sepals. The orchid's botanical structure reflects adaptations to its humid, tropical habitat."
