    "intro": "Hypericum kelleri, commonly known as the rock or stonecrop hypericum, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, succulent leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
