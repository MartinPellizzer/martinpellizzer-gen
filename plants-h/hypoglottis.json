    "intro": "Hypoglottis, commonly known as the \"whispering plant,\" is a unique species characterized by its specialized leaf structures. Its leaves are modified into narrow, tube-like shapes that facilitate the passage of air, enabling the plant to produce a soft, whisper-like sound when wind passes through. This adaptation is primarily for attracting specific pollinators, such as certain species of moths. The plant's botanical features include a fibrous root system and a woody stem that supports its upright growth. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions."
