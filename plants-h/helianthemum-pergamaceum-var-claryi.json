    "intro": "Helianthemum pergamaceum var. claryi, commonly known as Clary's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, blue-green leaves arranged in a rosette pattern, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, adding a delicate touch to rocky or sandy soils. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental appeal make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant landscapes."
