    "intro": "Hedyotis correllii, commonly known as the coralroot, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a mycoheterotroph. The plant relies entirely on fungal associations for its nutrients, as it does not perform photosynthesis. It produces small, white or pink flowers that are often overlooked due to its modest appearance. Hedyotis correllii thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest undergrowth."
