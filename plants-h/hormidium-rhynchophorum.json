    "intro": "Hormidium rhynchophorum, commonly known as the horned bladderwort, is a small aquatic plant belonging to the family Lentibulariaceae. It is characterized by its rootless, floating stems and specialized bladder-like structures used for capturing small aquatic organisms. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and ditches. Its leaves are simple and often covered in fine, hair-like structures that aid in water retention. Hormidium rhynchophorum is a carnivorous plant, relying on its bladders to supplement its nutrient intake in nutrient-poor waters."
