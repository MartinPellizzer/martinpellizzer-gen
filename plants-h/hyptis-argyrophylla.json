    "intro": "Hyptis argyrophylla, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its aromatic, mint-like scent. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. It produces small, tubular flowers in clusters, often in shades of purple or pink, which bloom during the warmer months. Hyptis argyrophylla is often used in traditional medicine and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its aesthetic appeal."
