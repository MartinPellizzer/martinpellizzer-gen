    "intro": "Hieracium naevium, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features bright yellow flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with a rough texture. Hieracium naevium is known for its ability to spread rapidly through rhizomes, making it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats."
