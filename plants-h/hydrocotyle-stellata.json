    "intro": "Hydrocotyle stellata, commonly known as the starleaf water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It has small, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are white with five petals. The plant thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common sight in marshes and along the edges of ponds. It is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic life. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it both a valuable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
