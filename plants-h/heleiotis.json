    "intro": "Heleiotis, commonly known as the sunflower, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow flower head surrounded by green leaves. The plant is known for its heliotropic behavior, where the flower follows the sun's movement during the day. Its seeds, encased in a hard shell, are widely used for oil production and as a food source. Heleiotis plays an important role in both ecological systems and human agriculture."
