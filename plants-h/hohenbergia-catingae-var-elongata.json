    "intro": "Hohenbergia catingae var. elongata, commonly known as the elongated hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its tall, narrow leaves that form a rosette shape, often with a reddish or pinkish hue along the edges. The plant produces striking inflorescences with bright orange or red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
