    "intro": "Halerpestes lancifolia, commonly known as the African cherry or African wild almond, is a deciduous tree native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are alternate along the branches. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by woody pods containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value and as a source of timber."
