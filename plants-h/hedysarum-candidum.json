    "intro": "Hedysarum candidum, commonly known as white vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hedysarum candidum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native environments."
