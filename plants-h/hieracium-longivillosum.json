    "intro": "Hieracium longivillosum, commonly known as the long-hairs hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features wiry, hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
