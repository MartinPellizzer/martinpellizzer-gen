It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
