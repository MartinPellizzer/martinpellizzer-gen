    "intro": "Hedysarum sussamyrense, commonly known as the Armenian needlepod, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and trifoliate leaves with small, elliptical leaflets. The plant produces pea-like flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, followed by narrow, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Hedysarum sussamyrense is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in ecological systems where it contributes to nitrogen fixation."
