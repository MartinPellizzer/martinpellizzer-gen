    "intro": "Hydrocotyle mexicana, commonly known as Mexican water pennywort, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Central America and parts of the southern United States. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features floating or submerged leaves that are usually heart-shaped with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. Its small white flowers bloom in clusters, often appearing in late summer to early autumn. Hydrocotyle mexicana is valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic life and its role in water filtration."
