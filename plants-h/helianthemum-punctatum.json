It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, adding a cheerful touch to rocky or coastal landscapes. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
