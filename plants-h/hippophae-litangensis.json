    "intro": "Hippophae litangensis, commonly known as the Litang sea buckthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of western China. It is characterized by its yellow-orange berries, which are rich in vitamins and antioxidants. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing at elevations above 3,000 meters. Its leaves are small and alternate, with a thick, waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soil and its potential economic value in traditional medicine and food."
