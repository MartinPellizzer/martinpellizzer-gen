    "intro": "Haworthia opalina, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a compact, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are pale green with distinct white or silver markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The leaves are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a unique, almost crystalline appearance. It produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the growing season. This plant is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and requiring minimal watering."
