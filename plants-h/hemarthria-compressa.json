    "intro": "Hemarthria compressa, commonly known as carpet grass, is a perennial grass native to the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, low-growing habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Hemarthria compressa is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in wetland environments."
