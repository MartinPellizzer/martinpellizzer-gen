    "intro": "Hymenocallis littoralis var. acutifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hurricane lily, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its narrow, strap-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in coastal areas and is adapted to saline and well-drained soils. It is often found in wetlands and along the edges of mangrove forests. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in warm climates."
