    "intro": "Haworthiopsis henriquesii, commonly known as the Henriques' Haworthia, is a small, succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically gray-green with white or pale blue markings. The leaves are thick and fleshy, adapted to store water in its arid native habitat. It produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, white flowers during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance and aesthetic appeal."
