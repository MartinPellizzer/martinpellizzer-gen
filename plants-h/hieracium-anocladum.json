    "intro": "Hieracium anocladum, commonly known as the coastal hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often along shorelines where it is adapted to salty and windy conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, contributing to its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
