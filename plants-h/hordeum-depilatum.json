It is characterized by its fine, hairless stems and narrow leaves, which are typically less than 2 mm in width. The plant produces small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences, with each spikelet containing two to three bracts. Hordeum depilatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in dry, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and potential agricultural use."
