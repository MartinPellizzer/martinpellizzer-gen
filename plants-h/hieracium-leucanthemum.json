    "intro": "Hieracium leucanthemum, commonly known as the white ragwort, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its flowers are yellow with white ray florets, and it produces seeds in a fluffy, wind-dispersed form. It is considered a weed in some areas but also serves as a food source for certain insects."
