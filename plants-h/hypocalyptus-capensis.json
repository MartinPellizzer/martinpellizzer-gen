It is characterized by its small, aromatic leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has a woody stem and is adapted to the nutrient-poor soils of its natural habitat. It is often found in coastal and mountainous regions, where it thrives in full sun. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is a valued species in both horticulture and conservation efforts."
