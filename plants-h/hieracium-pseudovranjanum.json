    "intro": "Hieracium pseudovranjanum, commonly known as the Serbian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides, preferring sunny conditions. It has hairy stems and leaves, and its yellow flowers are surrounded by a ring of pale yellow or white ray florets. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
