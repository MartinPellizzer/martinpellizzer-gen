    "intro": "Hydrocotyle versteegii, commonly known as the African water shield, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Africa. It features floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a waxy surface, adapted for life in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by dark, spherical fruits. Its rhizomes allow it to spread vegetatively, making it a common sight in wetlands and along the edges of ponds. Hydrocotyle versteegii plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
