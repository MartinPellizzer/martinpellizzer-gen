    "intro": "Hieracium coartans, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and borne in dense clusters. Hieracium coartans is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
