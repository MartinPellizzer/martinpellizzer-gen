    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. rimosum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and riverbanks. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a distinctive bipartite or split base. Its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers, which are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The subspecies is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread vegetatively."
