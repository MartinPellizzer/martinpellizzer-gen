    "intro": "Hieracium jasiewiczii, commonly known as the Jasiewicz's hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months. Hieracium jasiewiczii is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in drier environments."
