    "intro": "Huperzia mortonii, commonly known as the Morton's clubmoss, is a species of vascular plant in the family Huperziaceae. It is a small, evergreen fern-like plant that typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. The plant features a creeping stem with whorls of spirally arranged leaves, which are needle-like and often covered in a waxy cuticle. Huperzia mortonii is characterized by its spore-producing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in cushions on the underside of the leaves. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
