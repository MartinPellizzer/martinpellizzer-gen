It is a columnar cactus with a distinctive silver-blue coloration due to its dense covering of fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun exposure. Haageocereus vulpes is relatively drought-tolerant, making it a hardy choice for arid environments."
