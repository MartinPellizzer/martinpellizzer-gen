    "intro": "Hieracium prenanthoides subsp. ephemeridifolium, commonly known as the ephemeral leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are typically narrow and linear. The plant produces yellow composite flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its short-lived leaves and rapid flowering cycle are adaptations to its ephemeral growing conditions."
