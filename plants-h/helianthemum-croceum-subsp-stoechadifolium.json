    "intro": "Helianthemum croceum subsp. stoechadifolium, commonly known as the Scottish thimbleweed, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the British Isles. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has compact, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or heathland environments. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil in challenging landscapes."
