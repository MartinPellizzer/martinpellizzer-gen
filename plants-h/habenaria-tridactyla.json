    "intro": "Habenaria tridactyla, commonly known as the three-fingered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-white flowers with three prominent lobes that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky areas. It has a sympodial growth habit, with each stem producing a new shoot from the base. The leaves are usually broad and grass-like, and the plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake."
