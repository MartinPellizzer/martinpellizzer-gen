    "intro": "Hedysarum argentatum, commonly known as silver vetch, is a perennial legume native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and clusters of small, yellowish-pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has compound leaves with three to five oval-shaped leaflets and produces slender, bean-like pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Hedysarum argentatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it beneficial for soil enrichment."
