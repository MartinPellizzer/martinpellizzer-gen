    "intro": "Hippagrostis loliacea, commonly known as the yellow pimpernel, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a low-growing annual herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a hairy surface, and it produces small, yellow flowers clustered in umbels. Its flowers are often seen closing at midday, a trait that may help reduce water loss. The plant is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
