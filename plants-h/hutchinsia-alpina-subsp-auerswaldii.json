    "intro": "Hutchinsia alpina subsp. auerswaldii, commonly known as the alpine hutchinsia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in the high-altitude regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and flies. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
