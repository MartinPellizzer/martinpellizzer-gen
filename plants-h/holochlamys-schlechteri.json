The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, which are often borne on long, slender stalks. Its botanical classification places it within the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Holochlamys schlechteri is considered a species of conservation concern."
