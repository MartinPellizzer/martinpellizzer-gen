    "intro": "Halimium formosum, commonly known as the Chinese sandmat, is a low-growing perennial plant native to China. It features a mat-forming growth habit with silver-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in its survival in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its succulent leaves and drought tolerance are key adaptations to its native habitat."
