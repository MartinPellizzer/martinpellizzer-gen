    "intro": "Hieracium oligoclados, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often hairy, with a serrated edge, and its yellow flowers bloom from June to August. Hieracium oligoclados is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
