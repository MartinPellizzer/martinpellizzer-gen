    "intro": "Hakea excelsior, commonly known as the tall hakea, is a shrub or small tree native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flowers that are typically red or pink, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Hakea excelsior is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and can tolerate drought conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native gardens."
