    "intro": "Hieracium obtextum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. Its leaves are hairy and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Hieracium obtextum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stabilization."
