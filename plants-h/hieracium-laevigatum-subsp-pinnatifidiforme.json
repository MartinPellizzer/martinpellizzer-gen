    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. pinnatifidiforme, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial herb with a creeping rhizome and hairy stems that often form dense mats. The leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and typically have a finely toothed or lobed margin. Its yellow flowers are borne in clusters and are similar in appearance to other hawkweed species. This subspecies is characterized by its slender, pinnatifid (deeply divided) leaves, which distinguish it from other members of the genus."
