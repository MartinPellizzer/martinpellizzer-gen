    "intro": "Hieracium acrifolium, commonly known as the roughleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disc, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium acrifolium is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
