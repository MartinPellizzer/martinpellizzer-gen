    "intro": "Hydrocotyle cordifolia, commonly known as the heart-leaf water plantain, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically floating or partially submerged, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, white to greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, often appearing in late summer. Its root system helps stabilize soil and improve water quality in aquatic environments. Hydrocotyle cordifolia is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ecological benefits."
