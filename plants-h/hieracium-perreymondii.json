    "intro": "Hieracium perreymondii, commonly known as the Perreymond's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellow-orange flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium perreymondii is often found in rocky or grassy slopes, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates."
