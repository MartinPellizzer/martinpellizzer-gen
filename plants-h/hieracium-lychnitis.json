    "intro": "Hieracium lychnitis, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are usually borne in clusters, and the leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces. Hieracium lychnitis is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a resilient wildflower."
