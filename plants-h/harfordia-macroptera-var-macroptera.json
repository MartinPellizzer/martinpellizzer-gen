    "intro": "Harfordia macroptera var. macroptera, commonly known as the broad-leaved harfordia, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features lance-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically 3 to 6 inches long and have a dark green, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, white to pale purple flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sun, making it a suitable choice for wetland gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and ability to stabilize soil in riparian areas."
