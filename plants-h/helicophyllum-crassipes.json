    "intro": "Helicophyllum crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved helicophyllum, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its robust, upright stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Helicophyllum crassipes is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
