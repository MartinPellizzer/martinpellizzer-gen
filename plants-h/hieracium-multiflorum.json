    "intro": "Hieracium multiflorum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are hairy and alternate, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium multiflorum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
