    "intro": "Hieracium subterscissum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy areas and has dark green, hairy leaves that are alternate along the stem. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium subterscissum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
