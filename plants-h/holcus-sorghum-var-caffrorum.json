    "intro": "Holcus sorghum var. caffrorum, commonly known as the Cape grass, is a perennial grass native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open grasslands and disturbed areas. Due to its adaptability, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
