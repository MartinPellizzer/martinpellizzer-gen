It is characterized by its hard, dense wood, which is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, spiny fruits that contain single seeds. Heliocarpus australis is well adapted to coastal and sandy soils, making it a resilient species in challenging environments."
