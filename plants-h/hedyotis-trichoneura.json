    "intro": "Hedyotis trichoneura, commonly known as the hairy knotweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, followed by small, elliptical berries. Hedyotis trichoneura is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it both a useful ground cover and a potential weed in certain habitats."
