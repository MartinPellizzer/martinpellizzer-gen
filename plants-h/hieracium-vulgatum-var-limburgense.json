    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. limburgense, commonly known as the Limburg hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are clustered in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is considered a weed in some agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
