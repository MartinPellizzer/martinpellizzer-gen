It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs native to mountainous regions in East Asia. The plants typically have evergreen leaves and produce small, bell-shaped flowers that are often white or pink in color. Harmandia species are adapted to acidic soils and are often found in temperate forest ecosystems. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological importance in their native habitats."
