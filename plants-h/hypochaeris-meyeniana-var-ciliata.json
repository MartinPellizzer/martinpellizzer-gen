It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its leaves are hairy and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in the spring. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
