    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. multidens, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and grasslands, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are rigid and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk, typical of the genus Hieracium. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
