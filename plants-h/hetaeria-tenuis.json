    "intro": "Hetaeria tenuis, commonly known as the slender hetaeria, is a species of flowering plant native to certain regions of South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, a typical feature of the family. Hetaeria tenuis thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland understories or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for study in ecological and horticultural contexts."
