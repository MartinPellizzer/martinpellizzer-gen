    "intro": "Habenaria borealis var. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered northern orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the northern regions of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and bogs. The plant features a slender rhizome and produces small, greenish-white flowers with a distinctive lip. Its leaves are linear and often clustered at the base, contributing to its low-growing habit. This variety is noted for its adaptability to cool, humid climates and its role in local ecosystems."
