    "intro": "Hyphipus, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Melanthiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are herbaceous perennials native to North America. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating. Hyphipus species produce small, greenish flowers that are clustered in umbels, and they are often found in moist, shaded environments. These plants are not closely related to true hellebores but share some similar characteristics."
