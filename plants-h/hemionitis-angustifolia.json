    "intro": "Hemionitis angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionitis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It features small, narrow leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. It is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low water availability. Its botanical characteristics make it an important species for ecological studies in dryland ecosystems."
