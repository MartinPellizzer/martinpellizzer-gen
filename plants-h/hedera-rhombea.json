    "intro": "Hedera rhombea, commonly known as the rhombic ivy, is a climbing plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves, which are typically dark green with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are not particularly showy but are followed by bright red berries. Hedera rhombea thrives in shaded areas and is often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover vertical spaces in gardens."
