    "intro": "Hieracium peccense, commonly known as the stinking hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems, which are often covered in fine, white pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and wastelands. It produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. The plant is known for its strong, unpleasant odor, which is a defense mechanism against herbivores."
