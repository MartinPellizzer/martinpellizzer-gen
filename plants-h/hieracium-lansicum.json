    "intro": "Hieracium lansicum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring well-drained, sunny locations. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium lansicum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators and soil stability."
