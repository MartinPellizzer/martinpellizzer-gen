It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, gray-green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking blue to violet flowers arranged in a loose spike, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific care requirements."
