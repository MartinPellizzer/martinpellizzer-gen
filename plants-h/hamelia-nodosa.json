    "intro": "Hamelia nodosa, commonly known as the flamebeard or redroot dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features showy, red-orange inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits. Hamelia nodosa thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy addition to native gardens."
