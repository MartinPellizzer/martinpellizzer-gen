    "intro": "Hemianemia flexuosa f. genuina, commonly known as the flexible hemianthus, is a compact, low-growing aquatic plant native to South America. It features dense clusters of small, bright green, ovate leaves that form a carpet-like surface on the substrate. The plant thrives in shallow, slow-moving freshwater environments with moderate to high light conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread easily, making it a popular choice for foreground planting in aquariums. It is relatively easy to care for and requires regular pruning to maintain its compact form."
