    "intro": "Hoya lanceolata subsp. bella, commonly known as the Bell Hoya, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a slight variegation. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya lanceolata subsp. bella is also valued for its air-purifying qualities and ornamental appeal."
