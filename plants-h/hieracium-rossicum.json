    "intro": "Hieracium rossicum, commonly known as Russian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in dense clusters. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it has been introduced to North America, where it often invades disturbed soils. The plant is an annual or biennial herb that can spread rapidly through seed dispersal. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially invasive in non-native regions."
