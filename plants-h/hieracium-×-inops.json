    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 inops, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to various parts of the world, often becoming invasive in new habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open areas. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it a notable weed in agricultural and natural settings."
