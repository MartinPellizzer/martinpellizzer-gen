    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. cladophorum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow flowering heads composed of numerous small disc florets. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions."
