    "intro": "Heterotis entii, commonly known as the African water lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and lakes. The plant features broad, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with a distinct hood-like structure over the reproductive organs. Heterotis entii plays a role in providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates and can contribute to water filtration in its environment."
