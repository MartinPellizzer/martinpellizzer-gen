It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of South America, particularly in countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plants typically grow as shrubs or small trees, characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers. They often thrive in moist, well-drained soils and are adapted to humid, shaded environments. Hancea species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated for their unique foliage and floral displays."
