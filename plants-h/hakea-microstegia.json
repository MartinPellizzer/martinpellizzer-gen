    "intro": "Hakea microstegia, commonly known as the small-stemmed hakea, is a shrub native to the southwestern region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and grey-green foliage with a waxy coating. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that are covered in fine, hair-like structures. These cones contain small, hard seeds that are dispersed by animals and wind. Hakea microstegia is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing features that help it conserve water and survive in harsh conditions."
