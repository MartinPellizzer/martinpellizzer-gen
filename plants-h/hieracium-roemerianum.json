    "intro": "Hieracium roemerianum, commonly known as the roemer's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Native to Europe, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant has small, bract-like leaves that help protect the flowering heads. It is often considered a weed due to its rapid spread and ability to colonize various environments."
