    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. vulgare, commonly known as St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its yellow flowers with orange stamens and leaves that have translucent dots, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Its medicinal properties, including antidepressant effects, have been studied for centuries. However, it can be invasive in some regions and is toxic to livestock if ingested in large quantities."
