    "intro": "Helianthemum eriosepalum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically from June to August. The plant has a compact growth habit with dense, hairy foliage that helps it retain moisture in arid conditions. Its leaves are usually gray-green with a woolly texture, and the stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
