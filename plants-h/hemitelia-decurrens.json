    "intro": "Hemitelia decurrens, commonly known as the creeping hemitelia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests. The plant features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a slightly hairy surface. The small, white to pale pink flowers are arranged in clusters and bloom during the warmer months."
