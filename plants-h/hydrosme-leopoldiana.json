    "intro": "Hydrosme leopoldiana, commonly known as the Leopold's water plant, is a rare aquatic plant native to the wetlands of Central America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with soft, muddy substrates. The plant has slender, branching stems that float on the water surface, supported by long, fibrous roots. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged spirally along the stem, and it produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
