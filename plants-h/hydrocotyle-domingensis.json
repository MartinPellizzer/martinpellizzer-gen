    "intro": "Hydrocotyle domingensis, commonly known as the Mexican water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to Central and South America. It has small, rounded leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern on the water surface. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers with five petals, which bloom in the early morning. Its roots are anchored in the sediment at the bottom of water bodies, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Hydrocotyle domingensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and stabilizing water surfaces."
