It features small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to Mediterranean climates and suitable for xeriscaping."
