    "intro": "Helleborus trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae and is characterized by its dark green, waxy leaves with distinctive three lobes. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, white or pale green flowers in late winter to early spring. Helleborus trilobus is known for its toxic sap, which contains cardiotoxic compounds, making it poisonous to both humans and animals. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland habitats."
