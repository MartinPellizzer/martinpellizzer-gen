    "intro": "Hypoxis hemerocallidea, commonly known as the starry false shamrock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a rhizomatous root system and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with white markings. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often arranged in a rosette pattern. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. The flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a day, which is why it is also called the \"starflower.\""
