    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii subsp. domingense, commonly known as the Dominican hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Caribbean islands, particularly Dominica. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
