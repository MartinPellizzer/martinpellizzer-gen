It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are usually hairy as well. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, contributing to its ecological importance in native habitats."
