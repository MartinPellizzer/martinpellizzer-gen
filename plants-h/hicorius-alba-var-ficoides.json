    "intro": "Hicorius alba var. ficoides, commonly known as the white-leafed ficoid, is a rare and distinctive plant species characterized by its pale, almost translucent leaves. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is native to specific regions in Southeast Asia. The plant exhibits a unique growth habit, often forming compact clusters with a dense, fibrous root system. Its leaves are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface that reflects light, contributing to its striking appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
