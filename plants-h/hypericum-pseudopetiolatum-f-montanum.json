    "intro": "Hypericum pseudopetiolatum f. montanum, commonly known as the mountain St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy texture. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is typically found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it well adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments."
