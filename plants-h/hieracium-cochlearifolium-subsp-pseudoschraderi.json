    "intro": "Hieracium cochlearifolium subsp. pseudoschraderi, commonly known as the Schrader's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its leaf morphology, featuring a unique leaf shape that sets it apart from other Hieracium species. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
