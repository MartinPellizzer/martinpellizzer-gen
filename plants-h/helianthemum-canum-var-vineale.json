    "intro": "Helianthemum canum var. vineale, commonly known as the creeping sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. The plant has a mat-forming growth habit, with fleshy, succulent leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens."
