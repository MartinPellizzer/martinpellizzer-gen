    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. subturbinatum, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, glaucous leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological differences, particularly in the shape and structure of its flower heads. It is often found in calcareous soils and is considered a characteristic species of certain ecological communities."
