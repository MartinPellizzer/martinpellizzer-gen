    "intro": "Helictotrichon montanum subsp. velutinum, commonly known as the velvetleaf bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its fine, tufted foliage and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny blue to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its leaves are covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, which gives it its common name. It is often found in association with other native grasses and forbs in disturbed or semi-arid environments."
