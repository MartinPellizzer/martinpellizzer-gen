    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. circumvelatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are covered in dense, white hairs, giving it a woolly appearance, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It is often found in temperate climates and is considered a minor weed in some agricultural settings."
