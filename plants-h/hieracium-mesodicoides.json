    "intro": "Hieracium mesodicoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from June to September. Hieracium mesodicoides is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habits."
