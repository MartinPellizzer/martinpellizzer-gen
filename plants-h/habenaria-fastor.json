    "intro": "Habenaria fastor, commonly known as the narrow-leafed orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. The orchid's reproductive strategy involves specific pollinators, which play a crucial role in its ecological niche."
