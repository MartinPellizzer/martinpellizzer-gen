It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom from June to September. Hieracium latifolium is often found in open habitats and can sometimes become invasive in non-native regions."
