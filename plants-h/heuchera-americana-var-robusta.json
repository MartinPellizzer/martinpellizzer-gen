    "intro": "Heuchera americana var. robusta, commonly known as the American alumroot, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features dense, basal foliage that ranges from deep red to purple and green, depending on the cultivar and environmental conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, or red during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming clumps over time."
