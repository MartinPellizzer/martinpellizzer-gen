    "intro": "Hellerorchis gomezoides, commonly known as the Gomez's orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in its rocky, arid habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, adapted to reduce water loss, while its flowers are often pale green or yellow with intricate patterns. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hellerorchis gomezoides is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
