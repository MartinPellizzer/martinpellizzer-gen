    "intro": "Hieracium pallescens subsp. oligomeres, commonly known as the pale hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of linear, often hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in elongated inflorescences. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has a taproot system and is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes. The subspecies oligomeres is distinguished by its shorter flower heads and fewer ray florets compared to other subspecies of Hieracium pallescens."
