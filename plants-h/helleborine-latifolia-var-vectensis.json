    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia var. vectensis, commonly known as the broad-leaved helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and distinctive, showy greenish-yellow flowers with a white throat. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. The plant is also known for its ability to produce mycorrhizal associations, enhancing its nutrient uptake in nutrient-poor soils."
