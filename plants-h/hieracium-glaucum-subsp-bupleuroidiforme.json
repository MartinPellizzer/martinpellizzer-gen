    "intro": "Hieracium glaucum subsp. bupleuroidiforme, commonly known as the blue-veined hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with a distinctive blue vein pattern. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It has alternate, hairy leaves that are lanceolate in shape, and its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar appearance but can be distinguished by its unique floral markings."
