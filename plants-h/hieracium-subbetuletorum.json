    "intro": "Hieracium subbetuletorum, commonly known as the birchleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces yellow composite flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue, which distinguishes it from other hawkweed species. Native to Europe, it thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows."
