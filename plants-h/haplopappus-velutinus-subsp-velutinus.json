    "intro": "Haplopappus velutinus subsp. velutinus, commonly known as the woolly pappus plant, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silver-gray, woolly foliage that helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. Its leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This subspecies is well adapted to harsh, semi-desert conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
