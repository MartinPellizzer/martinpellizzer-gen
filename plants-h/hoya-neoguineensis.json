    "intro": "Hoya neoguineensis, commonly known as the New Guinea Waxplant, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of New Guinea and is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. The plant produces fragrant blooms in shades of white, pink, and red, which are typically borne on pedicels that are often longer than the flowers themselves. Hoya neoguineensis is a climbing or trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
