    "intro": "Hillia marcano-bertii, commonly known as the Marcano-Bertii hillia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to specific regions of the Caribbean. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its compact, herbaceous growth habit. The plant features lanceolate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and it produces small, tubular flowers in shades of white and purple. Hillia marcano-bertii thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in moist forests or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
