    "intro": "Holographis websteri, commonly known as the Webster's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its unique, pale greenish-white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. The plant is a terrestrial orchid with a slender, leafless stem that produces a single bloom. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as pine flatwoods and wetlands, often growing on the ground or on decaying wood. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Holographis websteri is considered endangered and is protected in many areas."
