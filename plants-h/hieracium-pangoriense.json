It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It features upright stems with rough, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
