    "intro": "Hieracium auriculinum subsp. firmisetiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features yellow ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular flowers, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough textures. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. The subspecies is distinguished by its firm, setose (bristly) involucres, which give it its specific epithet."
