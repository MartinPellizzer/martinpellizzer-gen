    "intro": "Helichrysum albirosulatum, commonly known as the white-veined everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces small, yellowish flowers that are often retained on the plant for a long period after blooming. The leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
