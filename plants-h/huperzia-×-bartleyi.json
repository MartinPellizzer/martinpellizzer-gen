It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Huperzia selago and Huperzia nephrophylla, characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit. The plant features lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and covered in a dense layer of trichomes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky or forested areas. Its unique morphology and hybrid origin make it a subject of interest in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
