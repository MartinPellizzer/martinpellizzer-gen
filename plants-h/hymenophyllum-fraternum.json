    "intro": "Hymenophyllum fraternum, commonly known as the common fernlet, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. The plant's intricate morphology and specialized adaptations make it a unique example of epiphytic life in forest ecosystems."
