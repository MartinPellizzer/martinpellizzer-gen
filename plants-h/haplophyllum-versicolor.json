    "intro": "Haplophyllum versicolor, commonly known as the variable leaf holly, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often variegated leaves that range in color from green to yellow and red. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland habitats. Its unique leaf coloration and ornamental value make it a popular choice for garden landscapes."
