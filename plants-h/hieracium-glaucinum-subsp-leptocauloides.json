    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. leptocauloides, commonly known as the slender-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant has hairy, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its basal leaves are lanceolate with serrated margins. It produces yellow flowers in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. The subspecies is distinguished by its slender, somewhat wiry stems and smaller, more compact leaves compared to other hawkweed species."
