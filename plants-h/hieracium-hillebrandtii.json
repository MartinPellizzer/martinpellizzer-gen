It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. It produces yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
