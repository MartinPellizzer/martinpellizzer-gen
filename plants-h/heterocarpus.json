    "intro": "Heterocarpus, commonly known as the mangrove apple, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rhizophoraceae. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in brackish water environments, making it a common species in coastal mangrove ecosystems. The plant produces distinctive fruits that are often buoyant, aiding in seed dispersal by water. Its roots are typically modified to anchor it in soft, waterlogged soils. Heterocarpus plays a vital role in stabilizing shorelines and supporting diverse marine and terrestrial life."
