    "intro": "Haworthia viscosa f. asperiuscula, commonly known as the rough-leaved haworthia, is a compact, rosette-forming succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings, and the leaves are notably rough to the touch due to their dense, tuberculate surface. The plant produces small, tubular flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well-suited to dry, well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it an ideal choice for rock gardens or indoor cultivation. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular ornamental plant among succulent enthusiasts."
