    "intro": "Hyalochaete, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiky, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has a succulent, fleshy stem and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Hyalochaete thrives in saline and well-drained soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its unique appearance and hardy nature make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscaping."
