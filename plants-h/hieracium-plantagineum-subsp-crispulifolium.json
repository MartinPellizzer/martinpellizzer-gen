    "intro": "Hieracium plantagineum subsp. crispulifolium, commonly known as the curly-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves that are often curled or crinkled, giving it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
