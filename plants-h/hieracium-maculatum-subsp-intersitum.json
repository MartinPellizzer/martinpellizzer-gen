    "intro": "Hieracium maculatum subsp. intersitum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and it produces small, clustered flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies intersitum is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and slightly smaller flowers compared to other varieties of Hieracium maculatum."
