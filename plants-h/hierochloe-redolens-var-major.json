    "intro": "Hierochloe redolens var. major, commonly known as the fragrant hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and delicate, grass-like foliage that often emits a sweet, aromatic scent. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of loose, open clusters of small, spikelet-like flowers, which contribute to its ornamental value. Due to its fragrant properties and aesthetic appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and used in floral arrangements."
