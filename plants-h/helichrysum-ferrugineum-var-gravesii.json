    "intro": "Helichrysum ferrugineum var. gravesii, commonly known as the golden everlasting or scarlet everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, bright yellow to orange-red flowers that remain intact even after drying, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant typically grows in shrubland and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. This variety is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in Mediterranean climates."
