It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored bracts that range from pink to red, which are often mistaken for flowers. The plant has small, inconspicuous true flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, surrounded by the showy bracts. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes. The variety glabrescens is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, contributing to its ornamental appeal."
