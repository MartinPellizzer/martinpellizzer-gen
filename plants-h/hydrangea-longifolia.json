It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink, blue, or purple depending on soil pH. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. Its leaves are ovate to elliptical, with a serrated margin, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in late spring.
