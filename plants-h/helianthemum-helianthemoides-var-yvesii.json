    "intro": "Helianthemum helianthemoides var. yvesii, commonly known as Yves' rockrose, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are usually covered in a white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically tubular and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for coastal and Mediterranean gardens."
