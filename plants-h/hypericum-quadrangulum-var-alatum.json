    "intro": "Hypericum quadrangulum var. alatum, commonly known as the winged St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, quadrangular stems that are often covered with fine, wing-like structures, giving it its common name. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, terminal inflorescences. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and usually covered with soft, glandular hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders."
