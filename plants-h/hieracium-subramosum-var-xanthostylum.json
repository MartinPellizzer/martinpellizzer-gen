    "intro": "Hieracium subramosum var. xanthostylum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers, which bloom in summer, are accompanied by rough, hairy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The species is known for its aggressive growth and can form dense mats, making it both a wildflower and a potential weed in certain environments."
