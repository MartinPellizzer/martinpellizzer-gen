    "intro": "Hieracium adpressifloccum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are basal, rough, and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in dense clusters. Hieracium adpressifloccum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is considered a weed in some regions due to its aggressive growth habit."
