    "intro": "Hieracium gypsophilum, commonly known as the gypsum hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in dry, calcareous soils, often found on rocky or gravelly ground. Its yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium gypsophilum is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
