It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet, with long, narrow leaves and a sturdy stem. Its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets, which give it a distinctive gladiolus-like appearance. Helenium grantioides is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and is relatively easy to grow in well-drained soil."
