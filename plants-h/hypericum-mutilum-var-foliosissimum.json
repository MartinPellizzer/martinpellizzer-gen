    "intro": "Hypericum mutilum var. foliosissimum, commonly known as the showy St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is notable for its larger, more showy foliage compared to the typical form of Hypericum mutilum. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodland areas."
