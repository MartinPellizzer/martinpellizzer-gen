    "intro": "Hydriastele cyclopensis, commonly known as the cyclops hydriastele, is a rare and unique fern native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, spiral-shaped fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with high moisture levels, often found in dense tropical forests. Its reproductive structures are complex, featuring specialized spore-producing organs called sporangia. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
