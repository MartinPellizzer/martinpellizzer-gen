    "intro": "Hazardia, commonly known as desert star or desert aster, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. These plants are native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. Hazardia species are characterized by their showy, daisy-like flowers and hairy, often gray-green foliage adapted to conserve water. They typically grow in sandy or rocky soils and are well-suited to harsh desert environments. Many species are used in xeriscaping due to their low water requirements and ornamental value."
