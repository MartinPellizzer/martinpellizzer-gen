    "intro": "Hypolepis polypodioides, commonly known as the rock fern, is a species of fern native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its compact, creeping growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or shaded environments. The plant has pinnate leaves with serrated margins, and its sporangia are clustered in sori on the underside of the fronds. It is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and its ability to tolerate poor soil conditions. The genus Hypolepis is part of the family Polypodiaceae, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial ferns."
