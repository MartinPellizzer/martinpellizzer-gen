    "intro": "Hesperochiron californicus var. strigosus, commonly known as the California hairy milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, and its pea-like, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Its adaptability to arid conditions makes it an important species in ecological restoration projects."
