    "intro": "Hexalepis, commonly known as the African ironwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Africa, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants are characterized by their dense, hard wood, which is highly valued for its durability and strength. Hexalepis species typically have simple, alternate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers. They are often found in dry, rocky habitats and are known for their ecological importance in their native ecosystems."
