It is characterized by its striking red or pink bell-shaped flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in moist, shaded areas within cloud forests. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a hairy texture, while its stems are slender and often branching. Hypseocharis corydalifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique floral display."
