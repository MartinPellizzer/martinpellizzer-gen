It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowering heads and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring temperate climates. Its leaves are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in composite inflorescences.
