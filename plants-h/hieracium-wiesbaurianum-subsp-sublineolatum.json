    "intro": "Hieracium wiesbaurianum subsp. sublineolatum, commonly known as the narrow-veined hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow ray florets surrounded by tubular disc florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has finely lobed leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in specific regions of Europe."
