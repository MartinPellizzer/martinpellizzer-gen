    "intro": "Hartmannia, commonly known as the orchid orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plants typically have compact, evergreen foliage and produce showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Hartmannia species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they rely on air moisture and nutrients from the environment. Their unique floral structure and ornamental value make them popular among orchid enthusiasts."
