It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has finely divided, hairy leaves and produces small, oval-shaped achenes as its seeds. The subspecies is distinguished by its reddish stems and flowers, which give it its common name."
