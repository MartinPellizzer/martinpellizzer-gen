    "intro": "Hypolepis glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a species of fern native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Davalliaceae and is characterized by its delicate, leathery fronds that are typically glabrous, or smooth. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical forests. Its rhizomes are creeping and can produce both sterile and fertile fronds. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, contributing to its reproductive strategy."
