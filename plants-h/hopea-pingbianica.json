    "intro": "Hopea pingbianica, commonly known as the Pingbian hopea, is a species of flowering plant in the family Dipterocarpaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in the tropical rainforests of Vietnam and Cambodia. The tree is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, elliptical leaves with a smooth, waxy surface. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. Hopea pingbianica is valued for its hard, durable wood and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
