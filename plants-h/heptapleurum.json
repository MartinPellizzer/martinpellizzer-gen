    "intro": "Heptapleurum, commonly known as the Chinese evergreen, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to Asia, particularly China, Japan, and Korea. These plants are characterized by their evergreen foliage, often with leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy. They typically produce small, clustered flowers that can be white, pink, or red, depending on the species. Heptapleurum species are valued in horticulture for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded environments."
