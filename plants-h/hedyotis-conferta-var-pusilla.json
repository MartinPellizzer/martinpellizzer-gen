    "intro": "Hedyotis conferta var. pusilla, commonly known as the small hedyotis, is a small, herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features delicate, whorled leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late winter to early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
