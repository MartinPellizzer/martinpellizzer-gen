    "intro": "Haplophyllum ibericum, commonly known as the Iberian haplophyllum, is a flowering plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Polygonaceae, which includes buckwheat and knotweeds. The plant is characterized by its basal leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is typically found in dry, open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
