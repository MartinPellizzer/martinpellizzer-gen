    "intro": "Hamatris triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaved liverwort, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is a non-vascular plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found on rocks or soil in temperate regions. The plant's structure consists of a thallus with three distinct lobes, giving it its common name. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, instead having a flattened, leaf-like structure called a thallus. Hamatris triphylla plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for microorganisms in its ecosystem."
