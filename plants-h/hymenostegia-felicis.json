    "intro": "Hymenostegia felicis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are usually heart-shaped and covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemose inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hymenostegia felicis is often found in disturbed habitats and is considered an invasive species in some regions."
