    "intro": "Hoya pubescens, commonly known as the velvety hoya, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya pubescens is also known for its slow growth and ability to climb or trail when provided with support."
