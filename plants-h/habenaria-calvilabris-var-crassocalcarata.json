    "intro": "Habenaria calvilabris var. crassocalcarata, commonly known as the thick-shouldered orchid, is a species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is a terrestrial orchid with a rhizomatous growth habit and produces tall, branching inflorescences. The flowers are typically pale green to yellowish with a distinctive, hairy labellum that gives the plant its common name. The leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps in water retention. This orchid thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories."
