    "intro": "Habenaria ipyanae, commonly known as the Irian Jaya orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the Indonesian island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a striking shade of violet. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest understories, where it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days, which makes it a challenging subject for botanical study. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat threats, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
