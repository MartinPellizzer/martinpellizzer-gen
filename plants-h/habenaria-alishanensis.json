It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pale green to yellowish flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or rocks. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the substrate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
