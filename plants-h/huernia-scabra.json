    "intro": "Huernia scabra, commonly known as the naked stem cactus, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems that are often covered in small, white spines. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. Huernia scabra is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick stems to survive in dry conditions."
