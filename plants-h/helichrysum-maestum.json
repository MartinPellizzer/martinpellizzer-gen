    "intro": "Helichrysum maestum, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a member of the Asteraceae family and is native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small suns, hence its common name. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers that are often used in dried flower arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum maestum is also valued for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine."
