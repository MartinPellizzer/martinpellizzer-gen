It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, upright stems covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of purple or blue during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are lance-shaped, often with a slightly hairy surface, and are arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well-suited to coastal environments and thrives in well-drained soils."
