    "intro": "Heliophila diffusa subsp. flacca, commonly known as slender heliophila, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet meadows, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies, preferring moist to wet soil conditions. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often hairless or slightly hairy, with small, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are white or pale blue, arranged in loose clusters, and bloom from late spring to early summer. It is valued in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity."
