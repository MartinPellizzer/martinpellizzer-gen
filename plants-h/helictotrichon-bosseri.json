    "intro": "Helictotrichon bosseri, commonly known as the Bosser's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and dense, compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale blue to purple flowers. Helictotrichon bosseri is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
