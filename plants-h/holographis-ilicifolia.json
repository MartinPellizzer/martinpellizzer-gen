It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that is typically silver or gray-green in color. The leaves are elliptical, leathery, and have a distinctive waxy coating that gives them their characteristic sheen. It produces small, inconspicuous white flowers in the spring, followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
