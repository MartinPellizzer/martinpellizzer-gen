    "intro": "Helichrysum citrispinum var. aberdaricum, commonly known as the Aberdare goldcup, is a flowering plant native to the Aberdare Range in Kenya. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange inflorescences that resemble small cups, which are often used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in high-altitude grasslands and has adapted to the cool, moist climate of its native habitat. Its foliage is typically covered in fine, silver-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The species is also valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
