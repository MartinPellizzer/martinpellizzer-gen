    "intro": "Haloragis masafuerana var. masafuerana, commonly known as the Masafuera rush, is a flowering plant native to the island of Masafuera in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like stems that grow close to the ground. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. It thrives in coastal and sandy habitats, often found in areas with limited soil and high salinity. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
