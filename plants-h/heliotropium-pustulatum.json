    "intro": "Heliotropium pustulatum, commonly known as the sticky heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its small, violet to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, often with a faint vanilla scent. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that produce a sticky substance, which can deter herbivores. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal areas or disturbed habitats. Heliotropium pustulatum is a member of the Malvaceae family, which includes other plants like cotton and hibiscus."
