It is a small annual herb with a basal rosette of leaves and a single, showy yellow flower that blooms in the spring. The plant produces a distinctive, fluffy seed head that aids in wind dispersal. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, and the flowers have reflexed petals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
