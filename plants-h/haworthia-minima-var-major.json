    "intro": "Haworthia minima var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale blue markings resembling a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences with small, star-shaped white flowers during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
