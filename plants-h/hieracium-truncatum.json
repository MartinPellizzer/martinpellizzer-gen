    "intro": "Hieracium truncatum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a distinctive truncate (notched) tip, giving it its scientific name. Hieracium truncatum is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
