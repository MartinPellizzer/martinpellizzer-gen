    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium var. fontqueri, commonly known as the narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a biennial plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, palmately lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, which develop into small, smooth, oval fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as stream banks and forest understories. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially allergenic due to its pollen."
