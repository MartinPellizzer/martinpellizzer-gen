    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescentiforme, commonly known as the blackening hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are rough and hairy, with a distinctive dark green color that may turn reddish or purplish at the edges. The flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small achenes that are dispersed by wind."
