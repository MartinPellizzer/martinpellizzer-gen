    "intro": "Helianthus tomentosus, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a perennial plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its hairy, grayish foliage and yellow, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as prairies and woodland edges. It has a robust root system that helps it survive in poor soil conditions. The woolly sunflower is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
