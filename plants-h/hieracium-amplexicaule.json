It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, hairy leaves that clasping the stem, giving it its scientific name. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Hieracium amplexicaule is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with composite flowers."
