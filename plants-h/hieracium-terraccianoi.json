    "intro": "Hieracium terraccianoi, commonly known as the Terracciano hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun exposure. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers range in color from yellow to orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
