    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum var. fuliginosum, commonly known as the sooty hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in mountainous areas where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local pollinator populations."
