The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often on rocky soils, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowers are small and yellowish, arranged in a single head, which is why it is referred to as \"single-head.\" The subspecies is distinguished by its unique morphology and habitat preferences, making it a notable species in its ecological region."
