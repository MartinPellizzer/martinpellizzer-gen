    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. jaubertianum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems bear numerous small, yellow disk flowers. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
