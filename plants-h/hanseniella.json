    "intro": "Hanseniella, commonly known as the ghost plant, is a unique genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Onagraceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often appear in clusters, typically with four petals. The plant is native to regions in South America, particularly in the Andes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Hanseniella species are often found growing in rocky or forested areas, and they have adapted to thrive in shaded conditions. Due to their rarity and specific habitat requirements, many species of Hanseniella are considered endangered."
