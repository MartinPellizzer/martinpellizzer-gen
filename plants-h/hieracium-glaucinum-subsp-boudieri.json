    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. boudieri, commonly known as the Boudier's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly lanceolate with serrated margins, and its flowering stems bear yellow composite flowers arranged in a single head. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, facilitating its spread in suitable environments. The species is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which contribute to its distinctive appearance."
