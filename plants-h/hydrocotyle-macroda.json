    "intro": "Hydrocotyle macroda, commonly known as the large-leaf water shield, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to the wetlands of North America. It features floating leaves that are broadly ovate with a waxy surface, allowing it to remain buoyant on water. The plant produces small white flowers that bloom in the summer, followed by dark blue berries that are dispersed by water currents. Its roots form dense mats on the water's surface, helping to stabilize the substrate and provide habitat for aquatic life. Hydrocotyle macroda is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater environments."
