    "intro": "Hemizonia pungens subsp. maritima, commonly known as the maritime hemizonia, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or violet in color. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to salty, wind-swept environments. Its leaves are usually narrow and often covered in fine hairs to reduce water loss. Hemizonia pungens subsp. maritima is often found in coastal dunes and is an important component of the local flora in these habitats."
