    "intro": "Hygrophila helodes, commonly known as water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. The plant has slender, erect stems that are often reddish in color, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy. Its small, purple or pink flowers are clustered in whorls along the stem and bloom during the warm season. Hygrophila helodes is often used in aquatic gardening and as a decorative plant in water features due to its attractive appearance and ability to thrive in moist conditions."
