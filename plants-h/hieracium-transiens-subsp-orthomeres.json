    "intro": "Hieracium transiens subsp. orthomeres, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
