    "intro": "Hieracium phrissoides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow to orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Hieracium phrissoides is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and can form dense colonies, making it both a common weed and an ecological indicator species."
