    "intro": "Hibiscus moscheutos var. flavescens, commonly known as the yellow swamp hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and marshy areas of the southeastern United States. It features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a red throat, and bloom from summer to fall. The plant has large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, pond edges, and along streams. Hibiscus moscheutos var. flavescens is a valuable plant for wetland restoration and provides nectar for pollinators."
