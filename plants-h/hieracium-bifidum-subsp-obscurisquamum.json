    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. obscurisquamum, commonly known as the dark-squamate hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in dense, dark-colored hairs. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head and are surrounded by leaf-like bracts. It is characterized by its distinctive subsp. features, including the dark, squamose (scale-like) leaves and its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
