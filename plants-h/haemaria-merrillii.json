    "intro": "Haemaria merrillii, commonly known as the Hawaiian sandalwood, is a rare and endemic species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It is a small tree or shrub with smooth, pale gray bark and lance-shaped leaves that are slightly hairy underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by small, woody fruits containing smooth, oval seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is classified as critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
