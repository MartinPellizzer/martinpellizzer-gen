It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, glandular leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its botanical structure is adapted to withstand extreme temperatures and limited moisture availability."
