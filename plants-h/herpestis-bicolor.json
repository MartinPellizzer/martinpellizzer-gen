    "intro": "Herpestis bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored weed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive two-toned leaves, which are typically green on the upper surface and white or pale green on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, often in late spring to early summer. Herpestis bicolor is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and it is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open fields. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it a common and sometimes invasive species in its native range."
