It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy foliage. The plant typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often have a rough, hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
