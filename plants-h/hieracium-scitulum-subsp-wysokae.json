    "intro": "Hieracium scitulum subsp. wysokae, commonly known as the highland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, pastures, and rocky slopes. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss in its alpine environment. This subspecies is often found in subalpine and alpine zones, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions."
