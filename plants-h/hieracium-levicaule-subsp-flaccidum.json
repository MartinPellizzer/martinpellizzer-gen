    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. flaccidum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its stems are usually erect and slightly hairy, and the flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. It is characterized by its relatively small size and distinctive foliage, making it a subtle yet notable member of the dandelion family."
