    "intro": "Hydroidea, commonly known as the sea gooseberry, is a genus of marine organisms belonging to the phylum Cnidaria. These organisms are typically found in coastal waters and are characterized by their gelatinous, transparent bodies. They possess a unique structure called a \"hydrocaust,\" which is used for capturing prey through a process called prey capture. Hydroidea are sessile, meaning they attach themselves to surfaces and remain in one place. Their simple body plan includes a central cavity surrounded by tentacles that contain stinging cells called nematocysts."
