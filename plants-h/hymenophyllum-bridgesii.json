    "intro": "Hymenophyllum bridgesii, commonly known as the New Zealand haircap moss, is a small, terrestrial moss belonging to the family Hypnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, hair-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of rhizoids, which help anchor it to moist substrates. The plant thrives in shaded, humid environments, typically found in forest floors or along rock faces in New Zealand. Its spore-producing structures, called capsules, are borne on short stalks and are typically clustered in dense groups. Hymenophyllum bridgesii plays a vital role in soil stabilization and moisture retention in its native habitat."
