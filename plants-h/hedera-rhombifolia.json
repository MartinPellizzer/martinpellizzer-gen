    "intro": "Hedera rhombifolia, commonly known as the rhombic ivy, is a species of evergreen climbing plant native to the western and central regions of Europe. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, rhomboid leaves that are typically dark green with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera rhombifolia thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodlands and along rocky outcrops. Its adaptability and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for landscaping and horticultural use."
