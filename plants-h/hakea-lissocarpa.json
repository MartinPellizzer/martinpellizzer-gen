It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers that appear in late summer to early autumn. Its fruit is a woody follicle that splits open to release seeds. Hakea lissocarpa is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
