It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, ribbed stems and small, yellowish-green flowers.

Hoodia juttae is also notable for its unique chemical composition, which includes compounds like hoodia glycosides. These compounds have been studied for their potential appetite-suppressing properties."
