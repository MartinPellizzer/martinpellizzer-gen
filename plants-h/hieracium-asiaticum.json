    "intro": "Hieracium asiaticum, commonly known as the Asian hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is native to regions of Asia, including China and Japan, and is often found in meadows and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
