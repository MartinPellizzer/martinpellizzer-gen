    "intro": "Herniaria cinerea subvar. laxa, commonly known as the slender bladderwort, is a low-growing perennial herb native to arctic and alpine regions. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems covered with small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its succulent leaves and specialized structures allow it to thrive in nutrient-poor, rocky environments. This species is often found in tundra and mountainous habitats where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
