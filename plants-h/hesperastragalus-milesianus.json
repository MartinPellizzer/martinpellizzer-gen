    "intro": "Hesperastragalus milesianus, commonly known as the Milesian milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, often in rocky soils, and is adapted to drought conditions. It has compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces pods that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
