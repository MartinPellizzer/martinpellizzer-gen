    "intro": "Hypolepis stolonifera var. delasotae, commonly known as the Delasota shield fern, is a variant of the shield fern species native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its broad, leathery fronds that are typically divided into shield-shaped segments, giving it its common name. The plant produces sporangia on the underside of its fronds, which are clustered in sori, a typical feature of ferns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated as a houseplant."
