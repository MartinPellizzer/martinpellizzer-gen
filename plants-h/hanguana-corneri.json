    "intro": "Hanguana corneri, commonly known as the Corner's hanguana, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with elliptical leaves that are often hairy beneath. Its flowers, which bloom in clusters, are usually pink or purple and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, Hanguana corneri is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation programs."
