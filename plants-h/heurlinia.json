    "intro": "Heurlinia, commonly known as the African milk tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Euphorbiaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Heurlinia fischeri, which is native to southern Africa. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems that store water, adapting it to arid environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are typically surrounded by colorful bracts, which attract pollinators. Heurlinia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated as a decorative plant."
