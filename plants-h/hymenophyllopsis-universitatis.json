    "intro": "Hymenophyllopsis universitatis, commonly known as the University fern, is a rare and specialized fern species native to specific regions with high humidity and shade. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae, which includes small, delicate ferns typically found in tropical and subtropical environments. The plant has thin, delicate fronds that are often covered in a fine layer of moisture-retaining cells, aiding in its survival in moist, shaded habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the undersides of its leaves, a characteristic feature of many ferns. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for assessing environmental health."
