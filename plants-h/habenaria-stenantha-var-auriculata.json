    "intro": "Habenaria stenantha var. auriculata, commonly known as the auriculate orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It features slender, upright stems with a single, lance-shaped leaf that is often adorned with a distinctive auriculate (ear-like) base. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a prominent, spurred lip. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in its unique floral structure and its role in local ecosystems."
