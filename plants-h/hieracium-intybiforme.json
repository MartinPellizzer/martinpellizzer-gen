    "intro": "Hieracium intybiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are usually hairy and serrated, while the flowers are yellow with a distinctive, fluffy appearance. Hieracium intybiforme is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
