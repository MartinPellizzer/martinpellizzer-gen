    "intro": "Henckelia miniata, commonly known as the dwarf pomegranate, is a small shrub native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and glossy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, bright red berries that resemble those of the pomegranate, though they are not edible. Henckelia miniata thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant foliage and seasonal fruit display."
