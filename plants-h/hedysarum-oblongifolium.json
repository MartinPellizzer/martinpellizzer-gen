    "intro": "Hedysarum oblongifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf sweet clover, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It features trifoliate leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It plays a role in soil nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria. Hedysarum oblongifolium is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in restoration projects."
