    "intro": "Hakea epiglottis, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive, spike-like inflorescences that bear bright yellow flowers. The leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds covered in a sticky, resinous substance. This plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
