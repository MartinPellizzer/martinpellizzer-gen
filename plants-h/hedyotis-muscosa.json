    "intro": "Hedyotis muscosa, commonly known as the mossy knotweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to various regions in Asia and Africa. It typically features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats on the forest floor. The leaves are small, ovate, and often covered with fine hairs, giving the plant a soft, moss-like appearance. It produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are usually borne on short pedicels. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments and is valued in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
