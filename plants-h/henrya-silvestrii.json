    "intro": "Henrya silvestrii, commonly known as the Sierra Henrya, is a rare and endemic plant native to the Sierra Madre Occidental in western Mexico. It is a low-growing, mat-forming shrub with small, fleshy, ovate leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually pink to reddish in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the cool, humid conditions of its mountainous habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henrya silvestrii is considered a vulnerable species."
