    "intro": "Hamosa coahuilae, commonly known as the Coahuila hamosa, is a rare flowering plant native to the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically pale yellow to greenish in color. The plant has a short, compact stem with narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species."
