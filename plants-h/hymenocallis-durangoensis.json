    "intro": "Hymenocallis durangoensis, commonly known as the Durango spider lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the highlands of Durango, Mexico. It features showy, white to pale pink flowers with a distinctive spider-like appearance, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are typically evergreen, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is a member of the Amaryllidaceae family, sharing characteristics with other members such as amaryllis and daffodils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
