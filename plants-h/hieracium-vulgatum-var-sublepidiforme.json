    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. sublepidiforme, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green leaves and yellow flowering heads that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring temperate climates. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. This variant is distinguished by its dense, woolly pubescence, which gives it a distinctive appearance and helps in reducing water loss."
