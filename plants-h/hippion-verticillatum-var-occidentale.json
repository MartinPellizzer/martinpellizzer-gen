    "intro": "Hippion verticillatum var. occidentale, commonly known as the western whorled milkweed, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features erect, branching stems that are typically hairy and covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers arranged in whorls along the stem, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated margin. This species is adapted to dry, sunny habitats and plays an important role in supporting native butterfly populations."
