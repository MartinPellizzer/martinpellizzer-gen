    "intro": "Herzogia odorifera, commonly known as the sweet-scented moss, is a species of liverwort belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its dense, cushion-like growth form and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant emits a faint, pleasant aroma, which is believed to be a natural defense mechanism against herbivores. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest floors or on rocky substrates. Herzogia odorifera plays a role in soil stabilization and contributes to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
