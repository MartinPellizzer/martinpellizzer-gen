    "intro": "Hemionitis pohliana, commonly known as the Chinese water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to East Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that resemble those of other water ferns. The plant typically grows in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize the substrate. Hemionitis pohliana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in water gardens."
