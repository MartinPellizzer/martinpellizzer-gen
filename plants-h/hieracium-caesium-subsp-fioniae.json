    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. fioniae, commonly known as the Fionian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows and woodland edges. It has finely divided, grass-like leaves and produces a single flower head at the end of each stem. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in parts of its range."
