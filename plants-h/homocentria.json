    "intro": "Homocentria, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush plant,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive inflorescences, which resemble a bottlebrush due to their dense clusters of small, tubular flowers. The leaves are typically simple and opposite, with a smooth or slightly serrated margin. Homocentria species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are used in traditional medicine in some regions."
