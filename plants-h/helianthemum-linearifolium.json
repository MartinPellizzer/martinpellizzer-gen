    "intro": "Helianthemum linearifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sunflower of the rock rose family, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has linear, needle-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, helping it retain moisture in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical characteristics make it well-adapted to Mediterranean climates and suitable for xeriscaping."
