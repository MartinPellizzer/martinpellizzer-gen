    "intro": "Hedyotis swertioides, commonly known as the Himalayan buttonweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and has small, lance-shaped leaves arranged alternately along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release tiny seeds when mature. Hedyotis swertioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
