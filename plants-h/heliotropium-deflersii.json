    "intro": "Heliotropium deflersii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing herb with slender, branching stems and small, hairy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces clusters of violet or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are typically tubular with five petals and are pollinated by insects such as bees and butterflies. Heliotropium deflersii is well-suited to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
