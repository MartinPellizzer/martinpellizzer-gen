    "intro": "Heliotropium diversifolium, commonly known as the variable leaf heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in moist, sandy soils along the edges of swamps and marshes. The plant produces clusters of small, pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate and vary in shape, which gives it its common name. Heliotropium diversifolium is also known for its ability to thrive in wetland environments and is often found in disturbed or flooded areas."
