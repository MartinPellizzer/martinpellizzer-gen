    "intro": "Hoya stafeensis, commonly known as the Variegated Wax Plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves that often display striking variegation patterns of white, green, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya stafeensis is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and attractive appearance. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
