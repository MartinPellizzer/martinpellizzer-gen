    "intro": "Hieracium mucronatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with prominent central disks. Hieracium mucronatum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
