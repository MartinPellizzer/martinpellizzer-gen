    "intro": "Humulus lupulus var. lupuloides, commonly known as the European hop, is a variant of the hop plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its cone-shaped, glandular-studded flowers, which are rich in lupulins, the compounds responsible for the plant's bitterness and aromatic properties. This variety is often used in brewing for its distinct flavor and aroma, though it is less common than the more widely cultivated Humulus lupulus var. lupulus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sunlight for optimal growth. Its botanical features make it an important component in both traditional and modern hop cultivation."
