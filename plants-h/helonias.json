    "intro": "Helonias, commonly known as swamp lilies, are flowering plants belonging to the Iridaceae family. They are native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States, where they thrive in moist, acidic soils. The plant features strap-like, grassy leaves and produces showy, orchid-like flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. Helonias typically bloom in late spring to early summer, and their growth is often associated with cypress swamps and other wetland habitats. Due to their specific environmental requirements, they are considered indicator species for healthy wetland ecosystems."
