    "intro": "Hieracium kalsianum subsp. ochroleucopsis, commonly known as the white-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a single head, with ray florets that are pale yellow to white in color. It thrives in rocky and alpine environments, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
