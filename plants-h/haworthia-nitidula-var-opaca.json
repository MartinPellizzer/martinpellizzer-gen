    "intro": "Haworthia nitidula var. opaca, commonly known as the opaca haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense, fleshy rosettes of pale green to bluish-gray leaves with a waxy, glassy appearance. The leaves are often covered in a fine, powdery coating that gives them a unique, almost translucent look. It produces small, white or pale green flowers on slender stems during the cooler months. This variety is prized for its striking appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
