    "intro": "Hammatolobium ludovicia, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its globular shape, with dense clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has hairy, silver-green foliage that helps reduce water loss in arid environments. Its root system is deep and fibrous, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Hammatolobium ludovicia is adapted to full sun and well-drained soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
