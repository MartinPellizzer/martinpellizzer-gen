    "intro": "Hymenanthera angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed honeywood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped, glossy dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, round, woody fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sub-coastal regions. Hymenanthera angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
