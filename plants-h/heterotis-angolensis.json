    "intro": "Heterotis angolensis, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive whorled arrangement of leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant thrives in moist environments, often found near water bodies such as rivers and wetlands. Its root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
