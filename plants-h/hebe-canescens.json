    "intro": "Hebe canescens, commonly known as the silver hebe, is a perennial shrub native to New Zealand. It features silver-gray, hairy foliage that gives it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Hebe canescens is also valued for its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
