    "intro": "Humularia descampsii var. acuta, commonly known as the sharp-tipped starwort, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to specific regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors or stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some areas."
