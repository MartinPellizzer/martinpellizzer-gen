    "intro": "Hieracium lactucoides, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, including North America. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Hieracium lactucoides is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
