    "intro": "Hieracium fastigiatum, commonly known as the upright hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30\u201360 cm, featuring basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with ray florets that are shorter than the disk florets. Hieracium fastigiatum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
