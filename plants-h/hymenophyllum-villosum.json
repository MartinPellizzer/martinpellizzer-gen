    "intro": "Hymenophyllum villosum, commonly known as the hairy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, soft, and velvety fronds covered in fine, silky hairs. This epiphytic plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum villosum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in high moisture and low light conditions."
