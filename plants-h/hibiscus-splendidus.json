    "intro": "Hibiscus splendidus, commonly known as the splendid hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that range in color from white to deep red, often with a prominent yellow or orange center. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine pubescence. Hibiscus splendidus thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
