    "intro": "Heteropogon, commonly known as the hairgrass, is a genus of grasses belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and fine, wiry leaves that often have a bluish-gray appearance. The flowers are small and clustered in spikelets, which are typically wind-pollinated. Heteropogon species are often found in moist or wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. These plants play a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various small organisms."
