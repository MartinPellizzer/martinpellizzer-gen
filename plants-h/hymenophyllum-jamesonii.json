    "intro": "Hymenophyllum jamesonii, commonly known as the Jameson's filmy fern, is a species of fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its rhizomes are short and often covered in a dense mat of rhizome scales. The spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori, which are protected by a specialized structure called a sorus."
