It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hypocyrta scabrida is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, Mediterranean climates."
