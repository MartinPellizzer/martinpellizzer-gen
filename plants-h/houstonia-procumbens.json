    "intro": "Houstonia procumbens, commonly known as the carpet bugleweed, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the southeastern United States. It features small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats on the forest floor. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine, soft hairs. Houstonia procumbens thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
