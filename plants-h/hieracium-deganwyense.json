    "intro": "Hieracium deganwyense, commonly known as Deganwy's hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the UK. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and distinctive leaf structures. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and road verges. It features bright yellow flower heads composed of numerous small florets, and its leaves are usually basal, with a rough texture. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a conservation priority in certain regions."
