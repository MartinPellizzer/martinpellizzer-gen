It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silky hairs. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are clustered in sori on the underside of its fronds. This species is notable for its adaptability and plays a role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
