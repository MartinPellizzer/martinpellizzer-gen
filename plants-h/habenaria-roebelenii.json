    "intro": "Habenaria roebelenii, commonly known as the pink lady's tresses, is a terrestrial orchid native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its dense, dark green to reddish-brown rhizomes and its flowering stems that bear numerous small, white to pinkish flowers arranged in a dense, trussed-like cluster. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forests and marshy areas. It has a complex root system that helps it absorb nutrients from the soil. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
