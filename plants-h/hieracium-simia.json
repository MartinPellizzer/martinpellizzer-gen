    "intro": "Hieracium simia, commonly known as the monkey's hieracium, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish to orange-yellow composite flowers, which are typically arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. The plant produces a milky sap that can be toxic to some animals and humans if ingested. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its common name reflects its resemblance to a monkey's face when viewed from a distance."
