    "intro": "Hedera helix var. pedata, commonly known as the giant ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its larger, more elongated leaves. It is a climbing evergreen vine native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found growing on walls, trees, and rocky surfaces. The leaves are typically lobed, with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance that sets it apart from other ivy varieties. It produces small, inconspicuous greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of light conditions."
