    "intro": "Hedyotis humilis, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Asia and Africa. It features small, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, and produces clusters of yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Hedyotis humilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
