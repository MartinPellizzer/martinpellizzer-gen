    "intro": "Hesperalbizia, commonly known as the desert acacia, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, particularly in countries like Namibia and Angola. The plant is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, bipinnate leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, arranged in dense, spherical clusters, and are adapted to attract pollinators like bees and birds. Hesperalbizia species are important for soil stabilization and provide forage for wildlife in their native habitats."
