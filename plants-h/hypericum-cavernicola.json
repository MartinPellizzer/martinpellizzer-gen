    "intro": "Hypericum cavernicola, commonly known as the cave St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are opposite, oval-shaped, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypericum cavernicola is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
