    "intro": "Heliconia pogonantha, commonly known as the red-throated heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that form a distinctive spiral shape, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically hidden within the bracts, which serve as a protective structure. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapting to the humid and sunny conditions of its natural habitat. Heliconia pogonantha is also valued for its role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and insects, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
