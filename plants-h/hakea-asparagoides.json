    "intro": "Hakea asparagoides, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces spikes of small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it resilient to coastal conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife. Hakea asparagoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
