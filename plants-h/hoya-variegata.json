    "intro": "Hoya variegata, commonly known as the variegated wax plant, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that often display striking patterns of white, yellow, and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Hoya variegata is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its slow growth and ability to develop aerial roots when grown in hanging baskets."
