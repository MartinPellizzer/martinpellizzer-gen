    "intro": "Hieracium washingtonense, commonly known as Washington's hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a member of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and forest edges. It has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, seed-filled flowers that are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
