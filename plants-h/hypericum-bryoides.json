    "intro": "Hypericum bryoides, commonly known as the mossy St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has creeping stems that form dense mats, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions. Hypericum bryoides is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in herbal medicine."
