It is characterized by its basal rosette of gray-green, hairy leaves and its ability to thrive in rocky, alpine environments. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically arranged in a single, terminal head. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is known for its adaptability to harsh, high-altitude conditions. Hieracium nevadense plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and provides nectar for pollinators."
