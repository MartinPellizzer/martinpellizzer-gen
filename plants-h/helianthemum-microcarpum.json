    "intro": "Helianthemum microcarpum, commonly known as the dwarf rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, evergreen leaves that are densely packed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in spring, which are typically borne on short, hairy stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. Its compact form and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
