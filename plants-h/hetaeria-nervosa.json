    "intro": "Hetaeria nervosa, commonly known as the slender lily, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands and marshes of eastern North America. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often tinged with red at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers with a subtle fragrance, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help it spread vegetatively and thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Hetaeria nervosa is an important component of wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various pollinators and aquatic organisms."
