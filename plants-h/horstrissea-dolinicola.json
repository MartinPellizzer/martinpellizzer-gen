    "intro": "Horstrissea dolinicola, commonly known as the Madagascar starflower, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the rainforests of Madagascar. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, star-shaped white flowers. The plant has thick, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its humid, shaded habitat. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation."
