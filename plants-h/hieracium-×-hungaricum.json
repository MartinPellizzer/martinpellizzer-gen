    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 hungaricum, commonly known as the Hungarian hawkweed, is a hybrid species within the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its hairy stems and yellow composite flowers that resemble those of other hawkweeds. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
