It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems covered in spines. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a striking visual element to its appearance. Its spines are more pronounced in this variety compared to the typical form, offering additional protection against herbivores. This succulent is well adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems."
