It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped foliage. The leaves are fleshy, triangular, and often have a waxy texture with translucent windows, which aid in photosynthesis. It produces small, yellow flowers on slender stalks during the summer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
