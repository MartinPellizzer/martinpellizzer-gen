    "intro": "Hypericum tosaense f. insulare, commonly known as the Tosa Hypericum, is a rare and endemic plant native to the islands of the Seto Inland Sea in Japan. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically features small, rounded leaves and produces clusters of orange-red berries that are a distinctive feature of the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas with sandy or rocky soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
