It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It has hairy, elongated leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
