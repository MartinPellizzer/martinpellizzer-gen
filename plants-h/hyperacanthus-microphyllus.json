    "intro": "Hyperacanthus microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leafed spikeweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features a dense, bushy growth habit with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces clusters of small, white to greenish flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming thick mats that help stabilize soil in moist environments. Due to its preference for wet conditions, it is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds."
