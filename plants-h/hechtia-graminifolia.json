    "intro": "Hechtia graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy hechtia, is a member of the Bromeliaceae family and is native to Mexico. It is a perennial herb with rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces striking, showy inflorescences that are typically orange or red in color, which attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. It thrives in shaded, humid environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
