    "intro": "Herminium kalimpongense, commonly known as the Kalimpong lady's tresses, is a rare orchid species native to the Himalayan regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, grass-like foliage and a floral spike that bears numerous small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in a loose, truss-like formation. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It has a tuberous root system that helps it survive in its cool, humid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
