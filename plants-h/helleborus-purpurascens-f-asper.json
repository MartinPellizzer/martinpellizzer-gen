    "intro": "Helleborus purpurascens f. asper, commonly known as the rough-leaved hellebore, is a variant of the purple hellebore, characterized by its textured, waxy leaves. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and is known for its dark, glossy foliage and striking, bell-shaped flowers that range from deep purple to black. The leaves are typically rough to the touch, giving the plant its 'asper' designation, which means rough in Latin. It is a perennial evergreen that thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant contains toxic compounds, making it important to handle with care."
