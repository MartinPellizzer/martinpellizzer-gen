    "intro": "Heteropterys rufula f. glabrata, commonly known as the smoothleaf heteropterys, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced pubescence compared to the typical form. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. The plant features elongated, lanceolate leaves with a smooth texture, and its flowers are typically clustered in inflorescences. It produces capsule fruits containing numerous small seeds, which are dispersed by wind. This variant is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological traits and potential ecological adaptations."
