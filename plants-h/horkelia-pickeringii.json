It is a member of the Boraginaceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
