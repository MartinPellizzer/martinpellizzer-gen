    "intro": "Hugonia obtusifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved hugonia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It features lance-shaped leaves that are often broad at the base, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, white or pale green flowers that are clustered in umbels, typically blooming in the summer months. Its root system is tuberous, which allows it to store nutrients and survive in varying environmental conditions. Hugonia obtusifolia is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
