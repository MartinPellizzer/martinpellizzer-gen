    "intro": "Hemionitis cucullans, commonly known as the hooded liverwort, is a small, non-vascular plant belonging to the family Porellaceae. It is characterized by its rosette-like growth pattern and the presence of a distinctive hood-like structure over the sporophyte. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rock crevices or forest floors. Its leaves are usually dense and closely packed, forming a compact mat. Hemionitis cucullans is often found in temperate regions and is considered an indicator of undisturbed, humid habitats."
