It features a basal rosette of linear, glaucous leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. Its reproductive structures are enclosed within a cup-like hypanthium, a characteristic feature of the genus Hymenostigma. The species is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
