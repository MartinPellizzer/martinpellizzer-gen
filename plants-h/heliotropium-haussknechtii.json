    "intro": "Heliotropium haussknechtii, commonly known as the desert heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, adapted to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually purple or pink, which bloom in clusters at the ends of its branches. Its leaves are often narrow and succulent, helping to reduce water loss. Heliotropium haussknechtii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its resilience to drought."
