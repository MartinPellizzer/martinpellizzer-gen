    "intro": "Helianthemum lavandulifolium, commonly known as the lavenderleaf sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial native to the rocky coastal areas of southern Europe. It features small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has aromatic, narrow leaves that resemble those of lavender, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to drought-tolerant plant collections."
