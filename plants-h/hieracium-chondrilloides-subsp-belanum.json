    "intro": "Hieracium chondrilloides subsp. belanum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering heads. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, preferring well-drained soils. Its yellow flowers are clustered in dense, flat-topped inflorescences, and it is often found at elevations above 1,500 meters. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
