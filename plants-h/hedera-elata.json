    "intro": "Hedera elata, commonly known as the American ivy, is a species of evergreen climbing plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves that are typically lobed or notched. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera elata thrives in shady, moist environments and is often found growing on trees and rocks. Its rapid growth and ability to climb make it both a popular ornamental plant and an invasive species in certain regions."
