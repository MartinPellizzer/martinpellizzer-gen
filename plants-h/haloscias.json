These plants are typically found in coastal areas and saline environments, showcasing their adaptability to harsh conditions. They are characterized by their striking blue or purple flower heads, which are often surrounded by spiky, leaf-like bracts. Haloscias species have succulent leaves and stems, which help them retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. Their unique morphology and ecological niche make them an interesting subject for botanical study."
