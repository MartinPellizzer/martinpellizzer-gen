    "intro": "Hieracium lanatum, commonly known as the downy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine white hairs. Its flowers are yellow and daisy-like, with a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium lanatum is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance."
