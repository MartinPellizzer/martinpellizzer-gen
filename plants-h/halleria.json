    "intro": "Halleria, commonly known as the \"Cape rose\" or \"red hibiscus,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to southern Africa, with a few found in Madagascar and the Comoros. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often with smooth, grayish bark and simple, alternate leaves. Halleria species are characterized by their showy, five-petaled flowers that range from pink to red, often with a yellow or orange center. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens for their vibrant blooms."
