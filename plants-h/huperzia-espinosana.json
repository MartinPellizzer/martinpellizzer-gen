It is characterized by its erect, sparsely branched stems and small, ovate leaves with a distinctive spiny margin. Native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Ecuador and Peru, it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is often found growing on rocky substrates or in moist, forested areas. Its unique morphology and habitat make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
