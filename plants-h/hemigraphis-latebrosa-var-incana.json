    "intro": "Hemigraphis latebrosa var. incana, commonly known as silver millefoil, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features opposite, ovate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage rather than its flowers."
