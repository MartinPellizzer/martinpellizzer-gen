    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and basal leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh environmental conditions. Hieracium glaciale is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra, playing a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
