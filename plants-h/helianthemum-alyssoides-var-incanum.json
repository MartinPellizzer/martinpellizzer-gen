    "intro": "Helianthemum alyssoides var. incanum, commonly known as the silver sandmat, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to southern Europe. It features small, fleshy, blue-green leaves covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically short-lived but numerous. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
