    "intro": "Haylockia pusilla var. aurea, commonly known as the golden dwarf haylockia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It features delicate, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green, with a striking golden hue along the edges. The plant produces tiny, clustered flowers that are usually yellow or orange, adding a subtle yet vibrant touch to its appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
