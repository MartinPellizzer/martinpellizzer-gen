It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and the plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium plessidicum is often found in open habitats and can sometimes form dense colonies."
