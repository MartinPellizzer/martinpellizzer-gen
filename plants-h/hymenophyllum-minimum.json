    "intro": "Hymenophyllum minimum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shield fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a short, thick rhizome and small, scale-like leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rock crevices, where it can retain moisture. Hymenophyllum minimum is often found in tropical and subtropical regions, where it plays a role in the understory vegetation of humid forests."
