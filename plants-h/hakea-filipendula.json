    "intro": "Hakea filipendula, commonly known as the silver-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silvery-blue foliage and cylindrical, woody fruiting structures. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its adaptations to arid environments include reduced leaf size and deep root systems for water storage. Hakea filipendula is often used in coastal and dryland landscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
