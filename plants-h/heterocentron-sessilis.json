    "intro": "Heterocentron sessilis, commonly known as the sessile water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are broad and heart-shaped, with a waxy surface to repel water. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive asymmetrical structure that is unique among water lilies. The plant has a short, thick stem that anchors it to the substrate, and its roots help stabilize the surrounding aquatic environment. It plays an important role in providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
