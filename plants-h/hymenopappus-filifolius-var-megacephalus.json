    "intro": "Hymenopappus filifolius var. megacephalus, commonly known as the giant desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has woody stems and hairy, lance-shaped leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Its fruit is a capsule that releases tufted seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. This species is adapted to extreme drought conditions and thrives in well-drained soils."
