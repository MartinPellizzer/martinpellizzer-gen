    "intro": "Hedera acuta, commonly known as the sharp-lobed ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to eastern Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with sharply toothed margins, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera acuta thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Its adaptability makes it a common sight in gardens and natural woodlands."
