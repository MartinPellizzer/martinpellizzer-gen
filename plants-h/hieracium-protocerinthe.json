    "intro": "Hieracium protocerinthe, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiny, upright stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has lance-shaped leaves with serrated edges and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Due to its prickly foliage, it is often avoided by grazing animals, which helps it persist in certain habitats."
