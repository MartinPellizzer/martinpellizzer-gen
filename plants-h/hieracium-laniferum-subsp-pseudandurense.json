It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in grasslands and rocky soils. It produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread across suitable habitats. The plant is relatively hardy and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
