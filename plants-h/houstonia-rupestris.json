    "intro": "Houstonia rupestris, commonly known as the rock bluebell, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in rocky, dry habitats such as sandstone outcrops and open woodlands. The plant produces clusters of small, sky-blue to violet flowers during the spring season. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a fibrous root system adapted to poor soil conditions. Houstonia rupestris is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
