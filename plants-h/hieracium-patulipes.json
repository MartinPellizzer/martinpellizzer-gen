    "intro": "Hieracium patulipes, commonly known as the broadleaf hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with rough, hairy surfaces, and its flowers are yellow with ray florets. It is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
