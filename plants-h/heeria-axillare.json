    "intro": "Heeria axillare, commonly known as the creeping heeria, is a small, evergreen shrub native to southern Africa. It features dense, compact growth with small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heeria axillare is well-suited for rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit and drought tolerance. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage and delicate floral display."
