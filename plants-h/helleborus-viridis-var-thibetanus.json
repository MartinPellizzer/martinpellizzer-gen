    "intro": "Helleborus viridis var. thibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan green hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, green, and yellow, typically blooming in late winter or early spring. It prefers well-drained, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
