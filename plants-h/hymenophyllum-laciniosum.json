    "intro": "Hymenophyllum laciniosum, commonly known as the lace fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that give it a lacy appearance. The plant typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid, shaded environments. Its spores are produced on the underside of the fronds in clusters called sori. Hymenophyllum laciniosum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in terrariums or as a houseplant."
