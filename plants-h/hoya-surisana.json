    "intro": "Hoya surisana, commonly known as the \"Coral Hoya,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, oval-shaped leaves that are often variegated with shades of white and green. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Hoya surisana is an epiphytic plant, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without being parasitic. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
