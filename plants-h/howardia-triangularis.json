    "intro": "Howardia triangularis, commonly known as the triangular euphorbia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It features a distinctive, branching stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
