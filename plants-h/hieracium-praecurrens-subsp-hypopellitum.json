    "intro": "Hieracium praecurrens subsp. hypopellitum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. It has lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
