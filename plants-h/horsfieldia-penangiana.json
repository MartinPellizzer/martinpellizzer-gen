    "intro": "Horsfieldia penangiana, commonly known as the Penang orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the tropical rainforests of Peninsular Malaysia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its natural habitat. Its leaves are long and strap-like, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments with high rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat destruction, it is considered a vulnerable species."
