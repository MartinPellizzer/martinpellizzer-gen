    "intro": "Helicia parasitica, commonly known as the parasitic helicia, is a flowering plant species native to Southeast Asia. It is a hemiparasitic shrub that derives some of its nutrients from its host plants through specialized root structures called haustoria. The plant has small, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruits are capsule-like structures containing small, hard seeds. Helicia parasitica plays a role in the ecological dynamics of its habitat by influencing the growth and distribution of its host species."
