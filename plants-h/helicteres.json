    "intro": "Helicteres, commonly known as the \"bottlebrush\" plants, are a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. They are characterized by their distinctive inflorescences, which resemble a bottlebrush due to their dense clusters of stamen. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. The leaves are typically alternate and palmately lobed, while the flowers are usually yellow or orange in color. Helicteres species often grow as shrubs or small trees, and some are cultivated for their ornamental value."
