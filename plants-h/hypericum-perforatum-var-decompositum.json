    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. decompositum, commonly known as the fragrant st. john's wort. This variant is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers and the presence of translucent dots on its leaves, which are actually oil glands. It is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant contains hypericin and pseudohypericin, which are responsible for its medicinal properties. Its growth habit includes a spreading stem with opposite leaves, making it easily identifiable in its natural habitat."
