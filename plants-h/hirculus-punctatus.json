    "intro": "Hirculus punctatus, commonly known as the spotted hircus, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, which features a distinctive spotted pattern on its broad, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale pink, typically blooming during the spring and early summer months. Hirculus punctatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
