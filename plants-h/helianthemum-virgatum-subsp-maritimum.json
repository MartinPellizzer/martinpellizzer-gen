    "intro": "Helianthemum virgatum subsp. maritimum, commonly known as the sea holly, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of southern Europe. It features compact, mat-forming growth with silvery-gray foliage that reflects sunlight, aiding in heat resistance. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is highly tolerant of salt spray and coastal conditions. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
