It features small, densely packed yellow to orange flowers that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. The plant has silver-gray foliage with a fuzzy texture, and it thrives in full sun and well-drained soil. It is drought-tolerant and typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The flowers are composed of both ray and disk florets, giving it a daisy-like appearance."
