    "intro": "Hieracium pachyphylloides, commonly known as the thick-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of thick, waxy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers arranged in a dense, flat-topped cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Its foliage and floral structure are adapted to reduce water loss and maximize sunlight absorption in its native environment."
