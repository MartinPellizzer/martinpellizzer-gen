It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species with similar morphological traits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
