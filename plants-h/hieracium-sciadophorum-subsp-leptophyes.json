    "intro": "Hieracium sciadophorum subsp. leptophyes, commonly known as the slenderleaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head at the end of each stem. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it is characterized by its low-growing habit and distinctive leaf morphology. This subspecies is part of the larger Hieracium genus, which includes many other hawkweed species with similar ecological and botanical traits."
