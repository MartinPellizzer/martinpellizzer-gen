    "intro": "Hydrolea decurrens, commonly known as the creeping hydrolea, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a low-growing herb with succulent stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often blooming in summer. Its leaves are fleshy and arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. Hydrolea decurrens is often used in rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
