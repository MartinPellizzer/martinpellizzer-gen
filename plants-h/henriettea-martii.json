    "intro": "Henriettea martii, commonly known as the cloud forest orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude cloud forests of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant blooms that often display a mix of white, pink, and purple hues. The plant thrives in cool, humid environments with abundant mist, which is essential for its growth and development. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, adapted to capture maximum light in its shaded habitat. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Henriettea martii is considered a threatened species in its native range."
