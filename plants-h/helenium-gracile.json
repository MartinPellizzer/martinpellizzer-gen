    "intro": "Helenium gracile, commonly known as the slender sneezeweed, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, yellow-orange ray flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils in prairies and wetlands. It produces small, spiky seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread. Helenium gracile is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
