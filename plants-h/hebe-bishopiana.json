    "intro": "Hebe bishopiana, commonly known as the Bishop's hebe, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and dense foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, typically blooming in spring and summer. Hebe bishopiana thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its evergreen nature and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
