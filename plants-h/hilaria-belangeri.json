    "intro": "Hilaria belangeri, commonly known as the blue grama, is a perennial grass native to the central and southern United States. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and tufted growth habit, which makes it visually striking in native landscapes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping. Hilaria belangeri plays an important role in stabilizing soils and supporting local wildlife in its native habitats."
