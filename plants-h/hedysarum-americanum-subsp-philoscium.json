    "intro": "Hedysarum americanum subsp. philoscium, commonly known as American milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in open woodlands and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features trifoliate leaves with stipules and produces yellow pea-like flowers in late spring. Its pods are linear and contain several seeds, and it has a fibrous root system that helps stabilize soil. As a member of the Fabaceae family, it plays a role in nitrogen fixation, enriching the soil with nutrients."
