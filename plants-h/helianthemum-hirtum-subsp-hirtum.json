    "intro": "Helianthemum hirtum subsp. hirtum, commonly known as the hairy rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense, wiry stems covered in fine, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, showy yellow flowers in early spring, typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a similar hairy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained, sunny soils and is often found in rocky or limestone habitats."
