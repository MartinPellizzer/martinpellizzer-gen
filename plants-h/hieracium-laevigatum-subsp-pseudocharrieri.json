    "intro": "Hieracium laevigatum subsp. pseudocharrieri, commonly known as the smooth hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has a creeping growth habit with rhizomes, allowing it to spread vegetatively. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain environments."
