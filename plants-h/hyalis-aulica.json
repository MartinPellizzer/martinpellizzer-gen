    "intro": "Hyalis aulica, commonly known as the mountain hyalis, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. The plant features slender, erect stems with small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine pubescence. Its flowers are white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and bloom in late spring to early summer. Hyalis aulica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or alpine settings."
