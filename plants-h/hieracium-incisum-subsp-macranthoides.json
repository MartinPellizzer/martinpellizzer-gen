    "intro": "Hieracium incisum subsp. macranthoides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves. The plant produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and other open habitats. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in some regions."
