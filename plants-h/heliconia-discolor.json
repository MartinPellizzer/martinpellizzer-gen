    "intro": "Heliconia discolor, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, vivid red bracts that enclose its inflorescence, which consists of numerous small, yellowish flowers. The plant is a member of the Heliconiaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. Its leaves are large, lance-shaped, and often have a waxy texture, contributing to its visual appeal. Heliconia discolor thrives in humid, warm climates and requires well-drained soil to flourish."
