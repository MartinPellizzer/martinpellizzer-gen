    "intro": "Hieracium anthracostylum, commonly known as the black-stemmed hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are arranged in a composite head. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
