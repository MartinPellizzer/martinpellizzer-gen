    "intro": "Hydrilla verticillata var. tenuis, commonly known as narrow-leaf hydrilla, is a submerged aquatic plant native to Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it is often found in freshwater habitats such as lakes and ponds. It is an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats. Its botanical features make it highly adaptable to various water conditions, contributing to its ecological impact."
