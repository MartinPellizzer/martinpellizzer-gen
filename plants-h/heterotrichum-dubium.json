It is a small, acrocarpous liverwort that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. The plant has a thalloid structure with a dorsiventral leafy shoot system, and its leaves are usually elongated and arranged in a spiral pattern.

Heterotrichum dubium is often found in temperate regions and plays a role in soil stabilization and nutrient cycling in its ecosystem."
