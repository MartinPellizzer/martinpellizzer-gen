    "intro": "Helleriella, commonly known as the silverleaf nightshade, is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It is characterized by its small, often hairy leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to purple. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments, preferring well-drained soils. Helleriella species are often found in regions of southern Africa, where they thrive in dry, rocky habitats. Due to their toxic properties, these plants are generally avoided by livestock and humans alike."
