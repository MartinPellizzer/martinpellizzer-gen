    "intro": "Hickenia scalae, commonly known as the mountain hickenia, is a perennial shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, leathery foliage that is typically gray-green in color. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in terminal spikes, which bloom during the summer months. Hickenia scalae is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
