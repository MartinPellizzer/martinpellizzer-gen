It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy coating, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
