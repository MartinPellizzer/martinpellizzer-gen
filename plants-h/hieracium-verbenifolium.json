It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Hieracium verbenifolium typically grows in meadows and grasslands, thriving in well-drained soils."
