    "intro": "Hieracium atratum var. dolichaetum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in moist meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. It produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive if not managed properly."
