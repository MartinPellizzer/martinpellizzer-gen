    "intro": "Hieracium fraudans, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and leaves that are often glandular, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Hieracium fraudans is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native flora due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
