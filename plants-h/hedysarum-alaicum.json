    "intro": "Hedysarum alaicum, commonly known as the Alpine vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, and it has trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum alaicum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for soil enrichment in harsh environments. Its resilience to cold and poor soil conditions makes it an important component of alpine ecosystems."
