    "intro": "Habenaria dentata var. parageniculata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in wet, shaded environments such as marshes and forest floors. The plant features slender, erect stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are small and pale green or white, with three sepals and three petals, and are arranged in a loose spike. This orchid is known for its ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in association with other orchid species in its habitat."
