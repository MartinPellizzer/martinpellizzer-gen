    "intro": "Hieracium calothyrsum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragweed, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, woodlands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer, are surrounded by overlapping, leaf-like bracts. Hieracium calothyrsum is often found in colonies, forming dense mats that can outcompete other vegetation."
