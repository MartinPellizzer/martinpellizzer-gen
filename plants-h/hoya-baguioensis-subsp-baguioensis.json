It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant is a member of the Apocynaceae family and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This subspecies is relatively rare and is often found in humid, shaded environments in its native habitat."
