    "intro": "Hedera resinosa, commonly known as the resinous ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often slightly waxy and have a distinctive, resinous scent. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are not particularly showy, followed by black, berry-like fruits. Hedera resinosa thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Its unique chemical composition, including the presence of resins, makes it of interest in both horticulture and ethnobotanical studies."
