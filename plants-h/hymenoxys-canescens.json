    "intro": "Hymenoxys canescens, commonly known as the white sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers bloom in spring, and the plant produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hymenoxys canescens is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes."
