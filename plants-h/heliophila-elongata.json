    "intro": "Heliophila elongata, commonly known as the longleaf heliophila, is a herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant features slender, elongated leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats, which help stabilize aquatic environments. Heliophila elongata is valued for its role in water filtration and as a habitat for various aquatic organisms."
