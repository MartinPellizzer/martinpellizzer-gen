    "intro": "Hamaria, commonly known as the \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Hamaria tenuifolia, which is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plants are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. They often grow in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to their toxic properties, they are not typically cultivated for ornamental purposes."
