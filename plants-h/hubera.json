    "intro": "Hubera, commonly known as the golden bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silky hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. Hubera thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting blooms and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
