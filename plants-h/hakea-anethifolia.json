    "intro": "Hakea anethifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, narrow, and often bluish-green leaves that resemble those of anise, giving it its common name. The plant produces distinctive cylindrical flower spikes that are typically pink to red in color, appearing in spring. Hakea anethifolia is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant once established. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing nectar for native birds and insects."
