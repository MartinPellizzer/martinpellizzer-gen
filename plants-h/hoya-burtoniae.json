    "intro": "Hoya burtoniae, commonly known as the Burtons hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Convulvulaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand and Malaysia, where it grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic plant. The plant is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. It is valued in horticulture for its attractive foliage and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening. Hoya burtoniae thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
