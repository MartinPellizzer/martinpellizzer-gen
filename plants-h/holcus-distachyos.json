    "intro": "Holcus distachyos, commonly known as the common bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its fine, tufted blades and grows in dense, low mats, often in moist or shaded environments. The plant has narrow, parallel-veined leaves and produces small, two-flowered spikelets that are typically green or reddish in color. It is commonly found in lawns, meadows, and along riverbanks, where it contributes to soil stabilization. Holcus distachyos is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in various soil conditions."
