    "intro": "Hakea montana, commonly known as the mountain hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and clusters of small, needle-like leaves. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea montana is adapted to sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal gardens. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
