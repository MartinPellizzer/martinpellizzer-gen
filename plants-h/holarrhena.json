    "intro": "Holarrhena, commonly known as the Indian frankincense or the African angel's trumpet, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Holarrhena antiflamma and Holarrhena holotricha, which are native to Africa and southern Asia. These plants are characterized by their showy, often yellow or orange flowers and their distinctive, often branched, woody stems. The leaves are typically palmately lobed, and the plants can grow as shrubs or small trees. Holarrhena species are valued for their ornamental appeal and have traditional uses in medicine and as sources of resin."
