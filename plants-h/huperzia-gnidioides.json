    "intro": "Huperzia gnidioides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered growth habit and its distinctive, linear leaves that are often adorned with small, rounded teeth along the margins. Native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, this plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forests or on rocky outcrops. Its sporangia are clustered in strobila, which are borne on the upper surface of the leaves, a feature typical of many ferns. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
