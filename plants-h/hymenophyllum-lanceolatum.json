    "intro": "Hymenophyllum lanceolatum, commonly known as the lanceleaf filmy fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a fine, translucent layer of hair, giving it a filmy appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices, where it thrives in high humidity. Its spores are released from specialized structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum lanceolatum is an epiphytic or lithophytic species, meaning it can grow on other plants or rocks without being parasitic."
