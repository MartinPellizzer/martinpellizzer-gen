    "intro": "Hydnophytum grandifolium, commonly known as the giant stiltroot, is a climbing hemiparasitic plant native to Southeast Asia. It possesses specialized roots that form symbiotic relationships with fungi, enabling it to absorb nutrients from host plants. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its unique growth habit involves attaching itself to other vegetation for support and nutrient acquisition. Hydnophytum grandifolium is often found in moist, shaded forest environments."
