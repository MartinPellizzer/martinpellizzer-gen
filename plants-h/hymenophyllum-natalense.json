    "intro": "Hymenophyllum natalense, commonly known as Natal mistletoe, is a small epiphytic fern native to southern Africa. It typically grows on trees, especially in moist, shaded environments. The plant has delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, hair-like structures called trichomes. It produces spores in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. This species is notable for its ability to thrive in humid, tropical conditions and its role in the ecological balance of its native habitats."
