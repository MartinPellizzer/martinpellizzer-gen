    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella var. plurifloccum, commonly known as the hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant is characterized by its dense, fluffy seed heads that give it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
