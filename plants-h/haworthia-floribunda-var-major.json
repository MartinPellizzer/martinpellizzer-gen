    "intro": "Haworthia floribunda var. major, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves with distinctive white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces tall, branching inflorescences with small, tubular white or pale pink flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden displays."
