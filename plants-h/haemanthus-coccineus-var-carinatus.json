    "intro": "Haemanthus coccineus var. carinatus, commonly known as the red-hot poker or torch lily, is a striking perennial plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, spiky inflorescences that bear bright red or orange tubular flowers, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its unique appearance and long-lasting blooms make it a standout in both cultivated and natural settings."
