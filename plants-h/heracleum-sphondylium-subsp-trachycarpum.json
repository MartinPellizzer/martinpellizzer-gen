    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. trachycarpum, commonly known as the rough cow parsley, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the carrot family (Apiaceae) and is characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. The leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The flowers are small and white, arranged in a flat-topped cluster, and the plant produces small, ribbed fruits. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
