    "intro": "Habenorkis citrinabenis, commonly known as the yellow-flowered orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellow petals and sepals, which often feature intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in tropical rainforests, where it thrives in the shade of the canopy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The orchid's root system is adapted to absorb nutrients from the forest floor, making it a resilient species in its natural habitat."
