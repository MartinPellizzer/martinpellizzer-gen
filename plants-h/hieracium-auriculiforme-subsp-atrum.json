    "intro": "Hieracium auriculiforme subsp. atrum, commonly known as the black hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 60 cm. It produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
