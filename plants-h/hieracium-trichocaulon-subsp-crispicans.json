    "intro": "Hieracium trichocaulon subsp. crispicans, commonly known as the crinkled hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which are typically covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
