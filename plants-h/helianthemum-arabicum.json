    "intro": "Helianthemum arabicum, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are usually gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helianthemum arabicum is well adapted to rocky and sandy soils, making it a hardy plant in coastal and dry environments."
