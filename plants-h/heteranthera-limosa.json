    "intro": "Heteranthera limosa, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in wetland environments. The plant produces small, pink to purple flowers arranged in dense spikes, which bloom from summer to fall. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize soil in aquatic habitats. Heteranthera limosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting aquatic life."
