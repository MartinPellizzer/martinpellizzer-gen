    "intro": "Hieracium hypophalacrum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are bright yellow with a distinctive central disc. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
