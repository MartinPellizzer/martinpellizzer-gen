    "intro": "Hoya baguioensis subsp. hernaezii, commonly known as the Hernaez hoya, is a rare and striking member of the Asclepiadaceae family, native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, often blooming during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is a sought-after plant among collectors and enthusiasts."
