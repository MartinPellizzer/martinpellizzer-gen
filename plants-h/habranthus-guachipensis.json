    "intro": "Habranthus guachipensis, commonly known as the Guachip\u00e9 grass, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white to pale blue flowers. It thrives in high-altitude environments and is adapted to the cool, moist conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
