    "intro": "Hieracium alpinum subsp. folioliferum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves that are often lobed or toothed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, typically at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
