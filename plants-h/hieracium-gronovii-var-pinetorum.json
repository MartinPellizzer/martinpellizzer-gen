    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii var. pinetorum, commonly known as the pine forest hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to northern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed sites such as pine forests and clearings, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters during the summer months. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and is often found in association with other early successional plant species. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays a role in maintaining biodiversity in forested and transitional ecosystems."
