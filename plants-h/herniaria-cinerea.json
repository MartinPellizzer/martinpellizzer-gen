    "intro": "Herniaria cinerea, commonly known as silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its root system is extensive and often forms dense mats, helping to stabilize soil in rocky or sandy habitats. Herniaria cinerea is known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and is often found in coastal or arid environments."
