    "intro": "Hieracium euthytrichum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is an invasive species in some regions, often outcompeting native flora due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
