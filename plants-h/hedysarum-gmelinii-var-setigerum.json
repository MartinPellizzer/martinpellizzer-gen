    "intro": "Hedysarum gmelinii var. setigerum, commonly known as the Siberian vetch, is a perennial legume native to the cold climates of eastern Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers in late spring. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows and forest edges. Its root system is well-developed, allowing it to thrive in poor soils. It is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
