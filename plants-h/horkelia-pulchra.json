    "intro": "Horkelia pulchra, commonly known as the showy horkelia, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the sunflower family (Asteraceae) and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky habitats, such as slopes and cliffs, and thrives in full sun. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, seed-filled bracts that aid in wind pollination. Horkelia pulchra is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem."
