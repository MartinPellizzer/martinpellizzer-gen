    "intro": "Hippocrepis unisiliquosa subsp. armena, commonly known as the Armenian rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically produces a single, elongated siliqua (pod) that contains the seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
