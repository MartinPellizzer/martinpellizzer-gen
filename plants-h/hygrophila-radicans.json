    "intro": "Hygrophila radicans, commonly known as the water wisteria, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow water and moist soil, often found in marshy areas and along riverbanks. The plant has long, slender stems that root at the nodes and can form dense underwater vegetation. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and slightly hairy, with a bright green color. Hygrophila radicans is popular in aquariums due to its ability to oxygenate water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
