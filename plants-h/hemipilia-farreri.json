    "intro": "Hemipilia farreri, commonly known as the pink orchid, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories or rocky crevices. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a subtle fragrance that attracts specific pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hemipilia farreri is considered a species of conservation concern."
