    "intro": "Herminium spirale, commonly known as the spiral orchid, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its spiral arrangement of leaves, which gives it its common name. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Herminium spirale is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
