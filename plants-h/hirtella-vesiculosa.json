    "intro": "Hirtella vesiculosa, commonly known as the bubbleleaf hirtella, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its rounded, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a small, three-lobed capsule that splits open to release seeds. Hirtella vesiculosa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
