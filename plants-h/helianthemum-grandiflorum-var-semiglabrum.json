    "intro": "Helianthemum grandiflorum var. semiglabrum, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has greyish-green, fuzzy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
