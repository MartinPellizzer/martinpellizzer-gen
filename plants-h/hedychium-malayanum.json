It is a herbaceous perennial that produces striking, fragrant, yellow-orange flowers with a strong, spicy aroma. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. The flowers are not only ornamental but also attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
