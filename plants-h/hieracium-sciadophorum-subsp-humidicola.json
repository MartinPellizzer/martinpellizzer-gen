    "intro": "Hieracium sciadophorum subsp. humidicola, commonly known as the wetland hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in moist, often nutrient-poor soils. It has a fibrous root system and is often found in marshes and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
