    "intro": "Hieracium pallidum subsp. vulcanicum, commonly known as the volcanic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the volcanic regions of Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as rocky slopes and grasslands. The plant features bright yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, with slender, hairy stems and basal leaves. It has a fibrous root system and is adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Its distribution is largely restricted to areas with volcanic activity, reflecting its specialized ecological requirements."
