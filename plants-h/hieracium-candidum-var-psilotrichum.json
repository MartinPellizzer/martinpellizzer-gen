    "intro": "Hieracium candidum var. psilotrichum, commonly known as the white hawk's-beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its white petals are surrounded by a dense ring of yellow-orange disk flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
