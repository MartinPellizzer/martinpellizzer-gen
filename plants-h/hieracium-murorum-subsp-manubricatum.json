    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. manubricatum, commonly known as the rough mouse-ear hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its subspecies status highlights subtle morphological differences from the main species, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
