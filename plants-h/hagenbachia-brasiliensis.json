    "intro": "Hagenbachia brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian fern, is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is native to the humid forests of Brazil. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows on rocks or tree trunks in shaded, moist environments. The plant has intricate, lace-like fronds that are often covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in its humid habitat. It produces small, spore-bearing structures called soruses on the underside of its fronds. Hagenbachia brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
