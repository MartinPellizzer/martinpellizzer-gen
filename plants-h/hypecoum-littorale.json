    "intro": "Hypecoum littorale, commonly known as the sea holly, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple flowers and spiny, leaf-like bracts that surround the blooms. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils along the shorelines, thriving in saline and well-drained environments. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Hypecoum littorale is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and nectar for pollinators."
