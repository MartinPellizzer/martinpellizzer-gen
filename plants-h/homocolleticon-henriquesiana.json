    "intro": "Homocolleticon henriquesiana, commonly known as the Henriques' homocolletis, is a species of moth in the family Tischeriidae. It is characterized by its small size and distinctive wing patterns, which often feature intricate markings. The plant it is associated with is typically a flowering plant, though it is more accurately described as a host plant for its larvae. The larvae feed on the leaves of specific host plants, contributing to the ecological dynamics of its habitat. This species is of interest to entomologists due to its unique biological traits and limited distribution."
