    "intro": "Haplopappus zanartui, commonly known as the Zanartu's pappus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of northern Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and wind-dispersed seeds. The plant features a low-growing, mat-forming structure with silvery-gray foliage adapted to withstand harsh desert conditions. Its small, yellowish flowers bloom in spring, contributing to its ecological role in stabilizing sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
