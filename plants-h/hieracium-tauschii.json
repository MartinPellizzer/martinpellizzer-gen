It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and roadsides. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the summer, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively. Hieracium tauschii is known for its ornamental value and has been introduced to other regions as a garden plant."
