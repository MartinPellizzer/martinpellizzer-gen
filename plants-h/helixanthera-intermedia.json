    "intro": "Helixanthera intermedia, commonly known as the pink-flowered rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact growth habit and striking pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, thriving in high-altitude environments. Its flowers are borne on slender stems and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Helixanthera intermedia is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
