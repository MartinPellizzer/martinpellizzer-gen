It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with small, four-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. Hesperis salsuginea is often used in rock gardens due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
