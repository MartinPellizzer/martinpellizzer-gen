    "intro": "Hymenachne boiviniana, commonly known as the Boivin's sedge, is a species of flowering plant in the grass family Poaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spikelet-based inflorescences. Native to tropical and subtropical regions, this plant typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats. It has a rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread vegetatively. The plant's small, wind-pollinated flowers are often clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes."
