    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum, commonly known as the golden tongue orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive golden-yellow flowers with a prominent, tongue-like lip that is often speckled with darker markings. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils and cool, moist environments. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, and it is often found in small, scattered populations due to its limited distribution. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in many areas, making conservation efforts crucial for its survival."
