    "intro": "Hyparrhenia claytonii, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that often display a reddish or bronze coloration, especially during the dry season. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute flowers, typical of the Poaceae family. Hyparrhenia claytonii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savannas and open woodland areas. It plays a role in local ecosystems and has been used traditionally for thatching and other indigenous purposes."
