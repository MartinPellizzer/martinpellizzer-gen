    "intro": "Haplopappus foliosus subsp. foliosus, commonly known as the leafy pappus, is a perennial flowering plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, linear leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces achenes with a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
