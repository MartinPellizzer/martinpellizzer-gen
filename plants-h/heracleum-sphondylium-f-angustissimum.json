    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. angustissimum, commonly known as narrowleaf cowparsnip, is a botanical variant of the common cowparsnip. It is a biennial plant belonging to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its slender, angular stems and finely divided leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in umbels, which develop into small, round fruits. It is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. Its narrow leaves and reduced stature distinguish it from the more robust form of the species."
