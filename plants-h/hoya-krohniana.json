    "intro": "Hoya krohniana, commonly known as the \"Krohn's WAX plant,\" is a species of flowering plant in the family Asclepiadaceae. It is native to Southeast Asia and is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and waxy, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya krohniana is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. It is also known for its ability to produce aerial roots, which help it climb and attach to surfaces in its natural habitat."
