    "intro": "Haemodorum basalticum, commonly known as the basalt lily, is a striking perennial herb native to the wet tropical rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green, strap-like leaves and vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often near streams or in rocky crevices. Its flowers are tubular and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects, playing a role in pollination. The plant's unique appearance and habitat make it a notable species in its ecological community."
