    "intro": "Hypolepis tenuifolia var. hirsuta, commonly known as the hairy sword fern, is a variant of the sword fern species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its finely divided, serrated fronds that are covered in soft, hairy structures, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forests and stream banks, where it thrives in high humidity. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies, making it a common ornamental plant in shaded gardens. The fronds are evergreen, providing year-round foliage, and the plant is relatively low maintenance once established."
