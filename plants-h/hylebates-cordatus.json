    "intro": "Hylebates cordatus, commonly known as the red-eyed tree frog, is a species of tree frog native to Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant green body with striking orange and blue markings on its hands and feet. The plant-like appearance of the frog, with its leaf-shaped skin, helps it blend into its forest habitat. It is typically found in the canopy of tropical rainforests, where it relies on moisture and abundant vegetation. The frog's diet consists mainly of small insects, which it catches with its sticky tongue."
