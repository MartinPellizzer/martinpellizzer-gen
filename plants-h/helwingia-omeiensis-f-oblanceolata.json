    "intro": "Helwingia omeiensis f. oblanceolata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed helwingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the Saxifragaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red on the underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by orange-red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in shaded, moist environments and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
