    "intro": "Haplanthus, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their striking, velvety leaves and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Haplanthus species are typically herbaceous, with a compact growth habit that makes them popular as indoor houseplants. They thrive in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, often requiring moderate watering to prevent root rot. The genus includes several species, each with unique floral patterns and foliage textures."
