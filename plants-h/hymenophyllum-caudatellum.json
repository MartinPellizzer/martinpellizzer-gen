    "intro": "Hymenophyllum caudatellum, commonly known as the long-tailed fern, is a species of moss-like fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided leaves that resemble moss, though it is not a true moss. This plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on rocks or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its fronds are typically green to reddish in color and may have a slightly curled or twisted appearance. Hymenophyllum caudatellum is known for its unique morphology and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
