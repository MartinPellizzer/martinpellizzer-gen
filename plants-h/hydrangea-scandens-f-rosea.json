    "intro": "Hydrangea scandens f. rosea, commonly known as the rose-flowered climbing hydrangea, is a cultivar of the hydrangea plant characterized by its distinctive pink to red flower clusters. It is a vigorous climber that produces large, showy bracts that resemble flowers, which are actually modified leaves. The plant thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its blooms appear in late spring to early summer and can last for several weeks. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to cover trellises or walls with cascading color."
