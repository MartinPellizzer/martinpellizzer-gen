    "intro": "Halgania bebrana, commonly known as the desert milkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and pairs of opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or greenish in color, adapted to attract specific pollinators. Its milky sap, which is toxic to some animals, serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Halgania bebrana plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
