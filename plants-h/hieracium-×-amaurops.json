    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 amaurops, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a composite plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering heads that produce yellow or reddish-orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces seeds in small, dry fruits called achenes. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a wide range of morphological variations."
