    "intro": "Hieracium peleterianum var. tenuiscapum, commonly known as the slender-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
