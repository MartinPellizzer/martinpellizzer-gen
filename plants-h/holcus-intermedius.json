    "intro": "Holcus intermedius, commonly known as rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas such as meadows, ditches, and stream banks. The plant has slender, upright stems that can reach heights of up to 1 meter, and its leaves are narrow with a rough texture. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, two-ranked spikelets. Holcus intermedius is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates."
