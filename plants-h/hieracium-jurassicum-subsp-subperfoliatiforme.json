It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. It has a distinctive leaf morphology with subperfoliate basal leaves that partially encircle the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
