It features small, densely packed yellow flowers that resemble goldenrod, blooming in late summer and autumn. The plant has narrow, silvery-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is well-suited for rock gardens and dry, well-drained soils due to its drought tolerance. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
