    "intro": "Hieracium densicapillum subsp. niphobioides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its subspecies niphobioides is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter stature compared to other members of the species. This plant plays a role in stabilizing alpine soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its native habitat."
