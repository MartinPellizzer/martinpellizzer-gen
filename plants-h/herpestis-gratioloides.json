It belongs to the family Xyridaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are clustered in spike-like inflorescences and bloom in early summer. Herpestis gratioloides is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
