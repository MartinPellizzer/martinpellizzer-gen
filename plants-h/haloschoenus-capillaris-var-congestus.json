    "intro": "Haloschoenus capillaris var. congestus, commonly known as the tufted saltmarsh grass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of Australia. It thrives in saline and brackish wetlands, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its flowering stems produce small, spikelet-based inflorescences that are adapted to withstand coastal conditions. This variant is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
