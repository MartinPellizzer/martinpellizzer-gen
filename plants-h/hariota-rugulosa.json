    "intro": "Hariota rugulosa, commonly known as the roughleaf dayflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Commelinaceae and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or moist environments such as swamps and marshes. Its flowers, which range in color from white to pink, bloom in the morning and close by midday. Hariota rugulosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in saturated soils."
