    "intro": "Hieracium fruticiniforme, commonly known as the shrubby hawkweed, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and grasslands. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation."
