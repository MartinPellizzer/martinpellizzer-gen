    "intro": "Heliconia juruana, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is part of the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with bright red bracts that are often used in floral arrangements. Its leaves are large, broad, and have a waxy texture, which helps it thrive in humid environments. Heliconia juruana is also an important plant for pollinators, particularly hummingbirds, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
