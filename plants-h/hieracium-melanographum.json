    "intro": "Hieracium melanographum, commonly known as the black-stained hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically basal, rough, and covered in fine hairs, often with a dark green coloration. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
