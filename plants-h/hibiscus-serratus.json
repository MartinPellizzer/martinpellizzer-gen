    "intro": "Hibiscus serratus, commonly known as the serrated hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically range in color from white to pink or red. The leaves are serrated, giving the plant its common name, and they are often heart-shaped or ovate in form. Hibiscus serratus thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can be found in gardens and natural habitats across its native range."
