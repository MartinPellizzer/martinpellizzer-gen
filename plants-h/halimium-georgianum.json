    "intro": "Halimium georgianum, commonly known as the Georgian rockrose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has succulent, fleshy leaves that help it conserve water in its arid or rocky habitat. It is often found in limestone soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Halimium georgianum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
