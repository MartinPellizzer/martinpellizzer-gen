    "intro": "Hulsea vestita subsp. gabrielensis, commonly known as the Gabriel's hulsea, is a perennial herb native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves that are densely covered with white, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a terminal cluster, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and cloud forests. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
