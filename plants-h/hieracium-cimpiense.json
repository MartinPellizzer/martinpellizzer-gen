    "intro": "Hieracium cimpiense, commonly known as the Cimpiense hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are basal, rough, and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium cimpiense is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitat."
