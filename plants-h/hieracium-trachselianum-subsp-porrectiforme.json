    "intro": "Hieracium trachselianum subsp. porrectiforme, commonly known as the Alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. It has a fibrous root system and produces seeds in small, fluffy achenes. Due to its habitat specificity, it is often found in mountainous areas with cool, moist conditions."
