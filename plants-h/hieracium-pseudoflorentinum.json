    "intro": "Hieracium pseudoflorentinum, commonly known as the false yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow to orange composite flowers in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
