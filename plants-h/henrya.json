    "intro": "Henrya, commonly known as the rock heather, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ericaceae. These plants are native to the mountainous regions of Japan and are characterized by their low-growing, mat-forming habit. Henrya species typically feature dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white, pink, and red. The leaves are usually evergreen, leathery, and arranged in a compact, cushion-like structure. They thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and are often found in rocky or shaded environments."
