    "intro": "Herpyza, commonly known as the false dandelion, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. It consists of several species that are native to various regions in the Americas. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs. They produce small, yellow flowers that are clustered in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. Herpyza species are often found in dry, disturbed soils and are sometimes considered weeds in agricultural settings."
