    "intro": "Hieracium crocatum subsp. lespinassei, commonly known as the Corsican hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It has small, lance-shaped leaves and produces numerous ray florets that attract pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
