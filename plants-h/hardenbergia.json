    "intro": "Hardenbergia, commonly known as blue oat grass, is a perennial flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and striking blue or purple flower spikes. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hardenbergia thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil also makes it beneficial for soil enrichment."
