    "intro": "Helianthemum polyanthum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, hairy foliage that gives it its \"hirsutum\" designation, meaning \"hairy\" in Latin. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring and early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy addition to xeriscaped gardens."
