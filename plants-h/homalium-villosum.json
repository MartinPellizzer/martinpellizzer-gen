    "intro": "Homalium villosum, commonly known as the silky huito, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by orange or red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
