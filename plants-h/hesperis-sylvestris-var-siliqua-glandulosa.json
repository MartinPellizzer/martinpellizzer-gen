    "intro": "Hesperis sylvestris var. siliqua-glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular-siliquae sweet rocket, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the sweet rocket plant. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a distinct glandular texture that distinguishes it from other varieties. This plant prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
