    "intro": "Hymenophyllum buchtienii, commonly known as the Buchtien's spiky moss, is a small, epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, needle-like leaves that are typically less than 1 cm in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are produced in small, clustered structures called sori, which are located on the underside of the leaves. This species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in moist, shaded forest habitats."
