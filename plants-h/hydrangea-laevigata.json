    "intro": "Hydrangea laevigata, commonly known as the smooth hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, rounded clusters of white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has serrated, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and turn reddish in the fall. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ability to change flower color based on soil pH adds to its ornamental appeal."
