    "intro": "Hieracium marmoricola, commonly known as the marble weed, is a flowering plant species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are usually lobed and have a rough texture, while its flowers consist of a central disk surrounded by ray florets. Hieracium marmoricola is often considered a weed but can serve as a host plant for certain insects."
