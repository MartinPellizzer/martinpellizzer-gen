    "intro": "Hydrolea scorpioides, commonly known as the snake's head or scorpion's tail, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It features a sprawling growth habit with wiry stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Hydrolea scorpioides thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks."
