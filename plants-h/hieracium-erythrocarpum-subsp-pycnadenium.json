    "intro": "Hieracium erythrocarpum subsp. pycnadenium, commonly known as the red-fruited hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broadly lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers. The plant's most distinctive feature is its reddish, fleshy, and often clustered fruits, which are unique among the Hieracium species. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
