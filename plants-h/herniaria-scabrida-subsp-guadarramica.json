    "intro": "Herniaria scabrida subsp. guadarramica, commonly known as the Guadarramica sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial herb native to southern Europe. It typically thrives in dry, calcareous soils and is often found in rocky or gravelly habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are usually narrow, hairy, and adapted to reduce water loss, reflecting its drought-tolerant nature. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly rough, scabrous texture, which gives it its specific epithet."
