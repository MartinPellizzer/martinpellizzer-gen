    "intro": "Habenaria ituriensis, commonly known as the Ituri orchid, is a species of orchid native to the rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves and intricate, often fragrant floral structures. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, displaying a range of colors from white to pale yellow. Due to its habitat in remote and threatened ecosystems, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
