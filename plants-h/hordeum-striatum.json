    "intro": "Hordeum striatum, commonly known as the stripe barley, is a species of grass native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves with distinct stripes. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hordeum striatum is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in semi-arid environments. It has been historically used in traditional agriculture and has ecological significance in supporting pollinators."
