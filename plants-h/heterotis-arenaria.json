    "intro": "Heterotis arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Africa. It is a small, annual herb that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces clusters of small, blue or purple flowers that bloom in summer. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Heterotis arenaria is often found in disturbed habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal."
