    "intro": "Hyphear, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a rare and elusive plant with unique botanical features. It belongs to the family Hypheaceae and is characterized by its translucent, waxy leaves that emit a faint bioluminescent glow at night. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom only under specific environmental conditions, such as high humidity and low light. Its root system is highly specialized, allowing it to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter in shaded forest floors. Due to its rarity and delicate nature, Hyphear is considered a conservation priority in its native habitats."
