    "intro": "Hedysarum carnosulum, commonly known as the woolly vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often glandular stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by cylindrical, pod-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or rocky habitats. Hedysarum carnosulum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
