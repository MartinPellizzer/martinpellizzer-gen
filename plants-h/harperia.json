    "intro": "Harperia, commonly known as the common harperia, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants typically have alternate, simple leaves and produce clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, yellow, or green. Harperia species are often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. They are valued in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in partially shaded conditions."
