    "intro": "Heliamphora heterodoxa f. heterodoxa, commonly known as the heterodoxa pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often red-tinged pitcher-shaped leaves that serve as traps for insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, nutrient-poor environments, where it absorbs nutrients from captured prey. Its pitchers are typically filled with a digestive fluid that breaks down the insects' bodies. This species is notable for its adaptability to specific microclimates and its role in the unique ecosystems of the tepuis."
