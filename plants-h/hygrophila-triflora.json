It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and wetlands. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, blue to purple flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, making it visually striking. Hygrophila triflora is often used in water gardens and as a decorative plant in aquariums due to its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
