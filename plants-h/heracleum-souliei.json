It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
