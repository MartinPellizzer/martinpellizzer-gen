    "intro": "Hymenophyllum subfirmum, commonly known as the firm moss or narrow-leaved hymenophyllum, is a fern that belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate fronds that are typically less than 5 centimeters in length. The plant has a unique structure with a central midrib and a dense, overlapping arrangement of leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized indusium."
