    "intro": "Hieracium sparsum subsp. sparsum, commonly known as the slender hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in a cluster at the end of each stem. It is characterized by its finely divided leaves and the absence of a central stem. The species is known for its ability to spread through both vegetative growth and seed dispersal."
