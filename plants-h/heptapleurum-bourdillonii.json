    "intro": "Heptapleurum bourdillonii, commonly known as the African nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though the plant can cause skin irritation due to its stinging hairs."
