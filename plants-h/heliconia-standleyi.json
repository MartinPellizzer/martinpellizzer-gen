    "intro": "Heliconia standleyi, commonly known as the red heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces long, pendulous inflorescences with bright red or orange hues, which serve as an attraction for pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. Its leaves are broad and lance-shaped, often with a waxy texture that helps it thrive in humid environments. Heliconia standleyi is also valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens and as a cut flower in floral arrangements."
