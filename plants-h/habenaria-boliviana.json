    "intro": "Habenaria boliviana, commonly known as the Bolivian marsh orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that typically grows in wet, marshy habitats, often near rivers or in swampy areas. The plant produces delicate, greenish-white flowers with three sepals and three petals, characteristic of many orchid species. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered a rare and threatened species in its native range."
