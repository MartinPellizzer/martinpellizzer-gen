It is a low-growing shrub with succulent, fleshy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring and summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact form and vibrant floral display."
