    "intro": "Holodiscus discolor var. delnortensis, commonly known as the western snowberry, is a variant of the snowberry plant native to the western United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories. The plant features small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries that persist through the winter. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a distinctive white underside, contributing to its ornamental value. The berries are toxic to humans and livestock, making it important to handle with care."
