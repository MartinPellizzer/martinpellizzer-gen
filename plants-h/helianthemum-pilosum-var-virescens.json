    "intro": "Helianthemum pilosum var. virescens, commonly known as the green-flowered sandthrift, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with woody stems and small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom in spring and early summer. Its succulent leaves and drought-tolerant nature make it well adapted to rocky and sandy soils. It is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
