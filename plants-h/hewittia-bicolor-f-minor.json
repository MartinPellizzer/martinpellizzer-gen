    "intro": "Hewittia bicolor f. minor, commonly known as the lesser bluebell, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Its foliage consists of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
