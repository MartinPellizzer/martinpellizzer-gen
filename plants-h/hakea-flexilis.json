    "intro": "Hakea flexilis, commonly known as the slender hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical stems and narrow, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in spring and attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. Hakea flexilis is adapted to dry, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. Its structure and flowering habits make it an important component of local ecosystems."
