    "intro": "Hieracium asemum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium asemum is often considered a weed due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
