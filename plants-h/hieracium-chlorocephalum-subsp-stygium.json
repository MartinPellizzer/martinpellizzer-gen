    "intro": "Hieracium chlorocephalum subsp. stygium, commonly known as the green-headed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow disc flowers with bright orange ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. It is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in some areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the hawkweed group, with variations in leaf morphology and flower color distinguishing it from closely related subspecies."
