It features rosettes of fleshy, narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, white, star-shaped flowers on short stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
