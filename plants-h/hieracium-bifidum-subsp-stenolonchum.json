    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. stenolonchum, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. The plant features a basal rosette of narrowly lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single, terminal head of small, yellow florets. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrow, elongated stems and reduced leaf lobes compared to other hawkweed species."
