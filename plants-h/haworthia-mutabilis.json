    "intro": "Haworthia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asphodelaceae family and is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves. The leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a whitish bloom, which helps reduce water loss. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers on tall, slender stems during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
