    "intro": "Hypericum gracile, commonly known as slender St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain seeds. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
