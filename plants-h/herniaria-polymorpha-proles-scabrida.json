    "intro": "Herniaria polymorpha proles scabrida, commonly known as the scabrous bladderwort, is a small, low-growing plant native to coastal areas of Europe and North Africa. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a fine, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found in dune environments and coastal meadows. Its unique adaptations allow it to survive in harsh, coastal conditions with limited water availability."
