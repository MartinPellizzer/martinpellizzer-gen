    "intro": "Hieracium rigidistolonum, commonly known as the rigid-stoloniferous hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium rigidistolonum is known for its creeping growth habit, with stolons that help it spread across the ground."
