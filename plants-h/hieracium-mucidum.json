It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered heads, and its leaves are typically lance-shaped with rough textures. It is characterized by a strong, unpleasant odor, which is thought to deter herbivores. Hieracium mucidum is also known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions."
