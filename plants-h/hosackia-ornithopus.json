    "intro": "Hosackia ornithopus, commonly known as the prairie smoke, is a flowering plant native to North America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, feathery plumes that resemble smoke. The plant typically grows in open prairies and dry sandy soils, thriving in full sun. Its flowers bloom in early summer, producing small, pale purple to white blooms that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hosackia ornithopus is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in native plant restoration projects."
