    "intro": "Hieracium dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single terminal inflorescence, which is usually divided into two branches, giving it its common name. It thrives in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The species is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and ability to propagate through both seeds and rhizomes."
