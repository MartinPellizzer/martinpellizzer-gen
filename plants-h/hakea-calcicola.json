    "intro": "Hakea calcicola, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of Western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. Hakea calcicola is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for coastal gardens. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
