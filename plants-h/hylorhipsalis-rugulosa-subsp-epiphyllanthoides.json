    "intro": "Hylorhipsalis rugulosa subsp. epiphyllanthoides, commonly known as the epiphyllanthoides hylorhipsalis, is a rare and unusual member of the Acanthaceae family. It is an epiphytic plant, typically growing on the surfaces of other plants rather than in soil. The plant features small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its humid, shaded habitat. It produces small, tubular flowers that are usually white or pale pink, arranged in clusters. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a delicate and less commonly cultivated species."
