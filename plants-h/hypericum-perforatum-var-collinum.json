    "intro": "Hypericum perforatum var. collinum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a variant of the common St. John's wort. It is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, characterized by its opposite, narrow, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in summer. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along roadsides. Its leaves are notable for having translucent dots, a feature that distinguishes it from other Hypericum species."
