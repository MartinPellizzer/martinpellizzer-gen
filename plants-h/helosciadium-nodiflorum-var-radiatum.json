    "intro": "Helosciadium nodiflorum var. radiatum, commonly known as the Radiate Hellebore, is a rare and ornamental plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, velvety leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of waxy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers with a distinctive radiate appearance, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
