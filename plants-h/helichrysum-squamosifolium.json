    "intro": "Helichrysum squamosifolium, commonly known as the golden marguerite or coastal helichrysum, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble daisies, surrounded by narrow, gray-green leaves. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often found in coastal and sandy soils. Its foliage is covered in fine, scale-like hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Helichrysum squamosifolium is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
