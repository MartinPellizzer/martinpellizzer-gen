    "intro": "Hesperis nivalis, commonly known as the snowdrop, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding flowers that bloom in early spring, often before the leaves appear. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale yellow, with three petals and three sepals, forming a bell-like shape. Hesperis nivalis thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and woodland settings."
