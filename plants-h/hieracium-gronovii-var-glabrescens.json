    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth meadow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped, basal, and often covered with fine hairs, while the stems are usually glabrous, giving it its varietal name. The flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by petal-like rays, and it produces small, achene-like seeds that are dispersed by wind."
