    "intro": "Hymenophyllum rufofibrillosum, commonly known as the red-fibrous shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a dense, fibrous rhizome system that helps it anchor to tree trunks and absorb moisture from the air. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are covered by a protective indusium. This species thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests."
