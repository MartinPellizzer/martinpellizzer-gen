    "intro": "Hymenoxys jamesii, commonly known as the desert dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing, herbaceous perennial that thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant features basal leaves that are typically woolly and gray-green in color, adapted to reduce water loss. Its flowers are yellow and resemble those of a dandelion, with a single layer of petals. Hymenoxys jamesii is well-suited to desert conditions, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
