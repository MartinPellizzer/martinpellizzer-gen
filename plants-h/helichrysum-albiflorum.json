It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces fluffy, seed-filled cones that are adapted for wind dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its drought tolerance and ornamental value make it a popular choice in horticulture."
