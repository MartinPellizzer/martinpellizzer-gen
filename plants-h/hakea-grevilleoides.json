    "intro": "Hakea grevilleoides, commonly known as the Greville's hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features rigid, cylindrical stems covered in dense, fibrous bark. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to dry environments and is often found in heathlands and sandplains."
