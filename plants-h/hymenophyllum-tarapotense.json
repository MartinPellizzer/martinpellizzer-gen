    "intro": "Hymenophyllum tarapotense, commonly known as the Tarapotense filmy fern, is a small epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, leathery, and often hairy fronds, which are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spores are released from the tiny, stalked, and often clustered sorus structures on the underside of its leaves. Hymenophyllum tarapotense is notable for its intricate leaf venation and its ability to tolerate low light conditions."
