    "intro": "Hakea erinacea var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It features dense, cylindrical leaves that are typically blue-green in color, with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces showy, red or pink inflorescences that are composed of numerous small flowers arranged in spikes. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems to access groundwater. This variety is often used in native landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
