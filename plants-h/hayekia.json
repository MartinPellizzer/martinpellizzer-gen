    "intro": "Hayekia, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant has narrow, gray-green leaves that help reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. Hayekia produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its hardy nature makes it a popular choice for xeriscaping in drought-prone landscapes."
