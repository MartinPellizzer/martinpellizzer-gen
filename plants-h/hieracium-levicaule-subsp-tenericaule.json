    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. tenericaule, commonly known as the soft-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and alternate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its soft, fleshy leaves and relatively small, yellowish flowers that bloom in summer. It typically grows in open habitats such as meadows and grasslands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
