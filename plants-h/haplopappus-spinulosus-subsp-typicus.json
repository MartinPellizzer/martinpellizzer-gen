    "intro": "Haplopappus spinulosus subsp. typicus, commonly known as the spiny pappus, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth habit and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, followed by bristly, hair-like pappus structures that aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine, spinose hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Haplopappus spinulosus subsp. typicus is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient, dry conditions."
