    "intro": "Hydrastis jezoensis, commonly known as the Jezo yellow root, is a perennial herb native to the Korean Peninsula and parts of eastern Russia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its yellow rhizomes, which are rich in alkaloids. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately compound, with serrated edges, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early summer. Due to its medicinal properties, it has been historically used in traditional medicine for its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects."
