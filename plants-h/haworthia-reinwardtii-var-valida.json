It features a rosette of fleshy, dark green leaves with distinctive white or light green markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces small, pale green flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light. Due to its unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening and rock gardens."
