    "intro": "Hemionitis galeottii, commonly known as the rock fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered fronds that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. This unique coating helps the plant retain moisture in its harsh, dry environment. The plant thrives in rocky crevices and is adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, Hemionitis galeottii is considered a vulnerable species."
