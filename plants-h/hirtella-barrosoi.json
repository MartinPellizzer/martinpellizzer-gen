    "intro": "Hirtella barrosoi, commonly known as the Brazilian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical conditions. The plant is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety appearance. It produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, and its fruit is a small, capsule-like structure containing multiple seeds. Hirtella barrosoi is often found in shaded, understory environments within its native habitat."
