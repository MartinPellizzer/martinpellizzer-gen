    "intro": "Helianthemum nummularium var. obscurum, commonly known as the dark sandwort, is a low-growing evergreen perennial that thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. It features small, rounded, silver-gray leaves that are densely packed, giving it a compact appearance. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers in early summer, which are typically borne on short stalks. It is native to southern Europe and is often found in dry, sunny habitats such as cliffs and limestone soils. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
