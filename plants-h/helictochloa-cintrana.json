It typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant has narrow, blue-green leaves that are often rolled or folded, giving it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Helictochloa cintrana is adapted to arid conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native range."
