    "intro": "Hieracium picenorum subsp. picenorum, commonly known as the Piceno hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow flowering heads and basal rosette of leaves. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. It has finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, daisy-like flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in certain regions."
