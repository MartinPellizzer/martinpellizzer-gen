These plants are characterized by their showy, bell-shaped flowers that come in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and white. Heterophragma species are typically herbaceous perennials, often found in moist, shaded environments in their native habitats. They produce small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous tiny seeds. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
