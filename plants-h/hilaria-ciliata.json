    "intro": "Hilaria ciliata, commonly known as silky grama, is a perennial grass native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its fine, silver-gray foliage and tufted growth habit, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hilaria ciliata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native grasslands and shrublands. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in disturbed areas."
