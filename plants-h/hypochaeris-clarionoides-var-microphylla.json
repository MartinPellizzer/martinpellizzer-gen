    "intro": "Hypochaeris clarionoides var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved common sowthistle, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with hairy stems and alternate leaves that are lance-shaped and often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family, which are visited by various pollinators. It is native to temperate regions of the Americas and is often found in disturbed soils, roadsides, and open fields. Due to its rapid growth and adaptability, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
