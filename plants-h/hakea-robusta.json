It is characterized by its dense, woody structure and thick, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in summer, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea robusta is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and coastal areas. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and resilience to drought."
