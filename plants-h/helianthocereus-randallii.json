    "intro": "Helianthocereus randallii, commonly known as the Randall's night-blooming cactus, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its spiny stems and nocturnal blooming habit. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that open at night, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths and bats. Its structure includes areoles, which are specialized structures from which spines, flowers, and branches emerge. Helianthocereus randallii is adapted to arid environments, with thick, fleshy stems that store water and reduce transpiration."
