    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile f. plantagineum, commonly known as the variable rockrose, is a succulent shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features fleshy, often blue-green leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a popular choice for low-maintenance landscaping."
