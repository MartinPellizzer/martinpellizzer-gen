    "intro": "Hibiscus unidens, commonly known as the single-tooth hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its striking, single-toothed petals that give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its flowers are large, showy, and usually appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus unidens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and wetlands."
