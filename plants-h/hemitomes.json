    "intro": "Hemitomes, commonly known as false dandelions, are flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. They are characterized by their basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and bright yellow composite flowers. These plants typically grow in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. Hemitomes have small, wind-dispersed seeds that allow them to colonize new areas easily. Their botanical structure reflects adaptations to thrive in various environmental conditions."
