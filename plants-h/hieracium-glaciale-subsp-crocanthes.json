    "intro": "Hieracium glaciale subsp. crocanthes, commonly known as the glacier hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typical of the dandelion family. It thrives in cold, rocky environments and is adapted to withstand harsh alpine conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
