    "intro": "Hohenbergia loredanoana, commonly known as the Loredanoana bromeliad, is a striking plant native to the humid forests of Brazil. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a central cup to collect rainwater. The plant produces vibrant, long-lasting inflorescences that range in color from red to orange, often blooming in late summer or early autumn. Its foliage is thick and textured, with a waxy coating that helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Hohenbergia loredanoana is well-suited for indoor cultivation, requiring bright, indirect light and well-draining soil."
