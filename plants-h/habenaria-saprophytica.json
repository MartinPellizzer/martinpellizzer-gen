    "intro": "Habenaria saprophytica, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its elongated, leafless stems and striking white or pale purple flowers. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree branches or in damp forest floors. Its unique ability to absorb nutrients from decaying organic matter through its roots makes it a saprophytic species. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
