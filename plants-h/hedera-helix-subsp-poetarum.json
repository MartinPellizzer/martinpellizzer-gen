    "intro": "Hedera helix subsp. poetarum, commonly known as the poet's ivy, is a climbing evergreen vine native to southern Europe. It features dark green, glossy leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a distinctive notched or lobed margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by dark blue berries, which are edible but should be consumed in moderation. It thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and ability to climb surfaces. This subspecies is closely related to common ivy but is distinguished by its unique leaf shape and growth habits."
