    "intro": "Harpochilus, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that often grow in clusters on stems that emerge from rock crevices. The plants are native to the southern United States, particularly Texas, and are adapted to arid and rocky environments. Harpochilus species typically have narrow, grass-like leaves and produce showy, often fragrant blooms in shades of yellow, orange, and red. These plants are valued for their ornamental appeal and are sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
