    "intro": "Hedysarum buxbaumii, commonly known as the Buxbaum's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow pea-like flowers. The plant is adapted to dry environments, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing forage for wildlife in its native habitat."
