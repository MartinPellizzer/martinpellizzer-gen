    "intro": "Hieracium drosocalyx, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its flowers are yellow with purple markings, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium drosocalyx is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its invasive tendencies."
