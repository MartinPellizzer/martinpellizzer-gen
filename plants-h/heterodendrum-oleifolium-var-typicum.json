    "intro": "Heterodendrum oleifolium var. typicum, commonly known as the typical oilleaf heterodendrum, is a rare and specialized plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique foliage, featuring broad, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, oily hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters along the stems. Its oil-rich leaves have been of interest to botanists and ethnobotanists due to their potential ecological and medicinal properties. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
