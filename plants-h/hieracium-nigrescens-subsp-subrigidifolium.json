    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens subsp. subrigidifolium, commonly known as the rigid-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It features basal rosettes of stiff, dark green, hairy leaves that are often glandular and subrigid. The plant produces yellow flowers in a single terminal head, which is surrounded by bracts. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it distinguishable from other hawkweed species due to its robust foliage and specific floral structure."
