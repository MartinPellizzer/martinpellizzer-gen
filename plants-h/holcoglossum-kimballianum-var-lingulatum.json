    "intro": "Holcoglossum kimballianum var. lingulatum, commonly known as the Kimball's holcoglossum, is a rare and endangered orchid species native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dark green, strap-like leaves and produces striking, pale yellow to greenish-white flowers with a distinctive, elongated lip. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments at high elevations, often growing on rock faces or in forest undergrowth. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is critically endangered and requires urgent conservation efforts."
