    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hirsuta var. moschata, commonly known as the fragrant marsh pennywort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It features heart-shaped, hairy leaves that are often floating or submerged, adapting to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. The plant produces small, white flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves emit a mild, pleasant fragrance, especially when crushed, which is a distinguishing characteristic. It plays a role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
