    "intro": "Hirculus litangensis, commonly known as the Litang goat-antler plant, is a rare and unique species native to the high-altitude regions of Sichuan, China. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy, and often branched stems that resemble the antlers of a goat. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-white in color, and it has a short flowering period during the summer months. Hirculus litangensis is adapted to cold, arid environments and thrives in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered an endangered species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
