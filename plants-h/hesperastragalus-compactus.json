It is a member of the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, erect growth habit. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typically visited by pollinators such as bees. Its leaves are compound, with small, narrow leaflets, and it has a deep root system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Hesperastragalus compactus is often found in sagebrush steppe and other dry, rocky habitats."
