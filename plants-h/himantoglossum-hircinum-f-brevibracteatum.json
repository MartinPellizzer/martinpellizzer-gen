    "intro": "Himantoglossum hircinum f. brevibracteatum, commonly known as the short-bracted hare's-foot clover, is a rare and distinctive plant species native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its unique, spurred flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter bracts compared to the typical form, which are often less than 1 mm in length. It thrives in calcareous grasslands and open habitats, often growing in sunny, well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in many regions."
