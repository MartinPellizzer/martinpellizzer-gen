    "intro": "Hypericum dyeri, commonly known as the dwarf St. John's wort, is a low-growing shrub native to the western United States. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves and produces red or orange berries that are edible but not particularly flavorful. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hypericum dyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators."
