    "intro": "Hyoscyamus coelesyriacus, commonly known as the Syrian henbane, is a herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and large, violet or purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a rough texture and emits a strong, unpleasant odor. It contains tropane alkaloids, which make it toxic to humans and animals. Due to its poisonous properties, it is often avoided in gardens and requires careful handling."
