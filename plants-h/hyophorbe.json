    "intro": "Hyophorbe, commonly known as the tree hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to Madagascar and are characterized by their showy, often colorful flowers that resemble those of hibiscus. Hyophorbes are typically shrubs or small trees, with thick, woody stems and large, palmate leaves. They thrive in tropical and subtropical climates, often growing in coastal areas or on limestone soils. The flowers are usually borne in clusters and can be white, pink, or red, making them popular in ornamental horticulture."
