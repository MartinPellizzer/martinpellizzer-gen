It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and yellow disk flowers that are typically surrounded by pale yellow to orange ray florets. This subspecies is native to Europe and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, wind-dispersed seeds, which contribute to its ability to spread in open habitats. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Hieracium genus, with a preference for temperate climates."
