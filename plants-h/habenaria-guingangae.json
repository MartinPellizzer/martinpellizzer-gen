    "intro": "Habenaria guingangae, commonly known as the Guingang orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountainous regions. Its leaves are broad and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
