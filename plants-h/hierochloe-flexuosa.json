    "intro": "Hierochloe flexuosa, commonly known as bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and fine, wiry leaves that often curve in a zigzag pattern. This plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of slender, spike-like clusters of small, two-lobed spikelets. Hierochloe flexuosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local wildlife."
