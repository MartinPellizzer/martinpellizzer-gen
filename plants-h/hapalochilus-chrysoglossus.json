    "intro": "Hapalochilus chrysoglossus, commonly known as the golden-tongued orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Australia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow petals and a distinctive, elongated lip that gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils in open habitats. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
