    "intro": "Hamamelis communis, commonly known as the common witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter, making it a unique addition to the fall landscape. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that turn red in the fall, adding to its ornamental value. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin strips. Hamamelis communis is also valued for its medicinal properties, with extracts used in traditional remedies for skin and respiratory conditions."
