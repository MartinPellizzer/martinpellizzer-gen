It features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a waxy texture and a prominent midrib. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as a decorative houseplant. Its foliage is prized for its aesthetic appeal and air-purifying qualities."
