    "intro": "Helianthus crinitus, commonly known as the curlytop sunflower, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, showy yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces feathery, white to pale green bracts beneath the flower head, which give it its common name. Helianthus crinitus is often found in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes many other sunflowers and daisies."
