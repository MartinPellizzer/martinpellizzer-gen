    "intro": "Hieracium calodon subsp. psammophilum, commonly known as the sandhill hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to sandy and coastal environments in Europe. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as dunes, grasslands, and heathlands. The plant has basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in clusters at the end of its stems. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils. Its subspecific name, *psammophilum*, refers to its affinity for sandy soils."
