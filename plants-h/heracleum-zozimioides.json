    "intro": "Heracleum zozimioides, commonly known as the giant hogweed, is a tall, herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features large, umbrella-like compound leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, and it produces clusters of small, white flowers in late summer. The plant contains phototoxic sap that can cause severe skin irritation when exposed to sunlight. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils along riverbanks and roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
