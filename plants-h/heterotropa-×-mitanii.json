It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and showy, pale yellow to greenish flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, allowing it to spread easily in new areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential weed in agricultural settings."
