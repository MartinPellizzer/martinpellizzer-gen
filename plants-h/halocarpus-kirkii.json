    "intro": "Halocarpus kirkii, commonly known as the kauri pine, is a coniferous tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown bark and needle-like leaves that are typically 2\u20134 cm long. The tree produces cones that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or well-drained soils. Halocarpus kirkii is an important component of New Zealand's native forests and has cultural significance to the M\u0101ori people."
