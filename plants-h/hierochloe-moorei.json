    "intro": "Hierochloe moorei, commonly known as Moore's bluegrass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its fine, blue-green foliage and forms dense, low-growing mats. The plant typically thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to high-altitude environments. Its flowering stems bear small, spike-like inflorescences with slender, blue-green bracts. Hierochloe moorei plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine and subalpine ecosystems."
