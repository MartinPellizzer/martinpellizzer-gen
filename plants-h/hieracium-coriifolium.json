    "intro": "Hieracium coriifolium, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are hairy and serrated, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium coriifolium is often considered a weed but plays a role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
