    "intro": "Heracleum redolens, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to North America. It features a robust, hollow stem covered in fine hairs and large, umbrella-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in a compound umbel, which are followed by fluffy, white seeds. It is often found in moist meadows, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Due to its irritant sap, it is important to handle the plant with care."
