The plant has opposite, narrow leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and native garden landscapes."
