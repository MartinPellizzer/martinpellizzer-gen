    "intro": "Haplophyllum vermiculare var. cyrenaicum, commonly known as the Cyrenaic sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and features small, fleshy, greenish-blue leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces tiny, white or pale yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or xeriscapes."
