    "intro": "Hirtella silicea, commonly known as the siliceous hirtella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Myrtaceae. It is native to the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil, where it thrives in humid, tropical climates. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a slightly rough texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, woody fruits. Hirtella silicea is often found in shaded understory environments within its native habitat."
