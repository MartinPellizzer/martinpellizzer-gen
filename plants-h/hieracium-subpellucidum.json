It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features serrated, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and woodland edges. Its scientific name reflects the translucent, waxy appearance of its leaves, which are a distinctive botanical trait."
