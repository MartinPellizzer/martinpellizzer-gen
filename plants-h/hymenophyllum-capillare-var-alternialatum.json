    "intro": "Hymenophyllum capillare var. alternialatum, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, delicate fern that belongs to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, silky-hair-like fronds that give it a distinctive, almost metallic appearance. This variety is typically found growing on shaded, moist rock surfaces or tree trunks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its leaves are thin and leathery, with a unique structure that allows it to retain moisture in humid environments. The plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is prized for its ability to thrive in shaded, humid conditions."
