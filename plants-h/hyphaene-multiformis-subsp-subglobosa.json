It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers, which are followed by elongated, fibrous fruits. Its trunk is thick and covered in a fibrous, spongy material, which is often used in traditional crafts. This subspecies is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and important component of its native ecosystems."
