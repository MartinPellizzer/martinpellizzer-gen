    "intro": "Helothrix paludosa, commonly known as the marsh helothrix, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in temperate regions. It typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are usually greenish-white in color, arranged in clusters at the base of the plant. Helothrix paludosa plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
