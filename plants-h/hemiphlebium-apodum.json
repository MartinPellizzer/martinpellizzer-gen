    "intro": "Hemiphlebium apodum, commonly known as the lady's mantle, is a perennial plant belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its fern-like foliage, with lance-shaped, leathery leaves that are often covered in a whitish, waxy coating. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically found on the underside of the leaves. Hemiphlebium apodum thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its unique appearance and ability to thrive in specific conditions make it a valued addition to both natural and cultivated landscapes."
