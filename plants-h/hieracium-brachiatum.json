    "intro": "Hieracium brachiatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it has dark green, broadly lance-shaped leaves. It produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn, and it is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
