It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with rough textures, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium macrolygodes is known for its aggressive growth and can become invasive in certain regions."
