It has a delicate, translucent body with a central column surrounded by numerous tentacles. The organism is typically found attached to rocky substrates in shallow tidal zones. Its feeding mechanism involves using its tentacles to capture small planktonic organisms. The species plays an important role in marine ecosystems as both predator and prey."
