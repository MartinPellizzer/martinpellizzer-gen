    "intro": "Hymenolepis cynopus, commonly known as the common cycad, is a gymnosperm that belongs to the order Cycadales. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of fiber. Hymenolepis cynopus is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates and is often found in coastal areas."
