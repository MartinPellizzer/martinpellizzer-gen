    "intro": "Hygrophila tyttha, commonly known as water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to tropical regions. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, with its stems often floating on the water surface. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, blue or purple flowers that attract pollinators. It is often used in water gardens and for ornamental purposes due to its aesthetic appeal. Hygrophila tyttha is also valued for its ability to help purify water and provide habitat for aquatic life."
