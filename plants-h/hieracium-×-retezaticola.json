    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 retezaticola, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium auripunctatum and Hieracium piloselloides, exhibiting traits from both parent species. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows, across Europe. It produces yellow daisy-like flowers with ray florets and is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. Due to its hybrid nature, it shows genetic variability and can be challenging to classify botanically."
