    "intro": "Hyptis argyrophylla var. pedunculata, commonly known as silverleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its silvery-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale blue, arranged in dense clusters at the ends of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
