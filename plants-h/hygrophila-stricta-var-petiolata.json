    "intro": "Hygrophila stricta var. petiolata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf water hyssop, is a semi-aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features elongated, narrow leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive whorled arrangement. The plant produces small, blue to purple flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in shallow water environments and is often found in wetlands, ponds, and along the edges of rivers. Its rapid growth makes it a popular choice for water gardeners and pond landscapes."
