    "intro": "Huperzia rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed clubmoss, is a species of fern ally native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing, herbaceous habit and its distinctive, spirally arranged leaves. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical formations called strobila. Huperzia rufescens typically thrives in shaded, moist environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its rhizome system is well-developed, allowing it to spread and colonize various substrates effectively."
