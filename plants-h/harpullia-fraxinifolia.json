    "intro": "Harpullia fraxinifolia, commonly known as the golden apple or white sapote, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and large, palmately lobed leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers that give way to yellow-orange fruits resembling small apples. The fruit has a thin, leathery skin and a sweet, creamy pulp with a nutty flavor. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruit, though its cultivation is limited due to its specific climatic requirements."
