It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. This subspecies is distinguished by its slender stem and reduced leaf size compared to other hawkweed species."
