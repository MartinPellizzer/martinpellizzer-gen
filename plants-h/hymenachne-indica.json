    "intro": "Hymenachne indica, commonly known as the Indian flat sedge, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in wetland environments such as marshes, swamps, and along riverbanks. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats. Hymenachne indica is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various wildlife species."
