    "intro": "Helichrysum diffusum, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant produces papery, dry flower heads that remain intact for a long time, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum diffusum is also valued for its ornamental use and is sometimes used in floral arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
