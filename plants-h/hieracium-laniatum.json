    "intro": "Hieracium laniatum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in dense, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance and help reduce water loss. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators like bees and butterflies."
