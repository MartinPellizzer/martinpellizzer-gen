    "intro": "Hypericum caprifolium subsp. naudinianum, commonly known as the Naudin's St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are alternate, oval, and often covered in fine hairs. It belongs to the family Hypericaceae and is characterized by its medicinal properties, though it is less commonly used than other Hypericum species. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different floral structure and habitat preferences compared to the main species."
