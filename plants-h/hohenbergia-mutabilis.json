    "intro": "Hohenbergia mutabilis, commonly known as the variable hohenbergia, is a striking bromeliad native to Brazil. It is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that change hues throughout the year, often displaying shades of red, orange, and yellow. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving them a fuzzy texture. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This species is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
