    "intro": "Hieracium bidentatum, commonly known as the two-toothed hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and yellow ray flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has small, glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, which help reduce water loss. Hieracium bidentatum is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
