    "intro": "Hemicarpha micrantha var. minor, commonly known as the small-flowered hemicarpha, is a perennial grass species native to parts of Africa. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas, often in regions with a Mediterranean climate. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with spikelets. Its flowering period usually occurs during the warmer months, and it is adapted to withstand drought conditions. The species is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphological features and ecological adaptations."
