    "intro": "Heterotrichum schanginii, commonly known as the Schangin's moss, is a small, acrocarpous moss belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is characterized by its closely appressed, dark green to brownish gametophyte with a short, stout stem. The leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a distinct costa that extends to the apex, and they often have a thick, papery texture. This moss is typically found in dry, shaded environments such as rock crevices and soil surfaces in temperate regions. It is noted for its ability to tolerate desiccation, making it a common species in xeric habitats."
