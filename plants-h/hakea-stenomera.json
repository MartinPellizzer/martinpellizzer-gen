    "intro": "Hakea stenomera, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to Western Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in summer, which are clustered in dense, cylindrical spikes. Hakea stenomera is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
