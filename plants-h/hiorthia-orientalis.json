It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. Hiorthia orientalis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its botanical structure reflects adaptations to its harsh native environment, making it a notable species in botanical studies."
