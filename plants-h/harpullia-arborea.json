    "intro": "Harpullia arborea, commonly known as the broad-leafed harpullia, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, glossy, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits containing a single seed. Harpullia arborea is often found in lowland rainforests and is valued for its hardy nature and ornamental appeal. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
