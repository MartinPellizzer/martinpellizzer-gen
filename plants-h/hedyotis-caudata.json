    "intro": "Hedyotis caudata, commonly known as the trailing strobilanthes, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis caudata is often cultivated as a ground cover due to its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded conditions."
