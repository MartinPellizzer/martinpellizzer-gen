    "intro": "Helonias breviscapa, commonly known as the short-stemmed marsh orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, sandy soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant features a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and flies. Helonias breviscapa is a member of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique adaptation to aquatic environments."
