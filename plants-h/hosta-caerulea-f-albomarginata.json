    "intro": "Hosta caerulea f. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-edged blue hosta, is a cultivar of the hosta plant characterized by its striking foliage. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and exhibit a deep blue-green color with distinct white margins that contrast beautifully with the central green. This plant is native to East Asia and thrives in shady, moist environments, making it ideal for woodland gardens. It produces small, fragrant flowers in late summer, though its ornamental value primarily comes from its foliage. The plant is relatively low maintenance and resistant to pests, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a reliable shade plant."
