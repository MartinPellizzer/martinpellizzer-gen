    "intro": "Habenaria panigrahiana, commonly known as the Panigrahiana orchid, is a species native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of India and Nepal. It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often in undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil. The orchid's botanical features make it a unique subject for horticultural study and conservation efforts."
