    "intro": "Hemitomes spicatum, commonly known as the spikeless grass, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. The plant has slender, tufted stems that bear small, spike-like inflorescences, which are characteristic of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a soft texture, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects. Hemitomes spicatum is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and support biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
