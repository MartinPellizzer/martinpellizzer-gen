    "intro": "Habenaria hieronymi, commonly known as the Hieronymus' orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and delicate, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for nutrient absorption from the soil. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
