    "intro": "Hieracium petrofundii, commonly known as the rock hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Hieracium petrofundii is often found in high-altitude meadows and is considered a rare and specialized species."
