    "intro": "Heliophila arenaria var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth sand heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to sandy soils in coastal and dune environments. It is characterized by its small, hairy leaves that become smooth as the plant matures, and its clusters of pink or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The species is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy, well-drained soils. It plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems and providing habitat for small insects and birds. Its ornamental value has also led to its cultivation in gardens with similar environmental conditions."
