    "intro": "Hieracium placerophyllum, commonly known as the golden hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
