    "intro": "Heuchera villosa var. villosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf alumroot, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It features basal rosettes of softly hairy, ovate leaves that range in color from silver to deep burgundy. The plant produces upright, branched clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and ability to naturalize make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
