    "intro": "Habenaria crocodilium, commonly known as the crocodile orchid, is a tropical orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, elongated flowers that resemble a crocodile's head, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are usually greenish-yellow with dark markings, and it produces a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators. The orchid has a complex root system and requires specific conditions to thrive in cultivation."
