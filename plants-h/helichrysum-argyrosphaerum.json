It is characterized by its dense, spherical clusters of yellow flowers that resemble small globes, hence its common name. The plant has narrow, silvery-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The flowers are long-lasting and often used in floral arrangements due to their preserved color and shape."
