    "intro": "Haplodiscus humilis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically features prostrate or decumbent stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are usually blue or violet in color, often with a white throat. Its leaves are ovate to lanceolate, with a hairy surface, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Haplodiscus humilis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
