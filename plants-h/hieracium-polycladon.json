    "intro": "Hieracium polycladon, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and woodland edges, preferring moist and well-drained soils. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. The flowers are yellow and appear in late spring to early summer, contributing to its role in supporting pollinators."
