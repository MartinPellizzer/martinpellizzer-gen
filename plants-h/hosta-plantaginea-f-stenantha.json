    "intro": "Hosta plantaginea f. stenantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaf plantain hosta, is a cultivar of the hosta plant characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves. It originates from the broader species Hosta plantaginea, which is native to East Asia. The foliage of this variety is typically dark green with a subtle silvery sheen, and it tends to have a more upright growth habit compared to other hosta varieties. It is well-suited for shaded gardens and requires well-draining soil to thrive. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and adaptability to moist, woodland conditions."
