    "intro": "Hormopetalum, commonly known as the fairy lantern or candle bush, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Proteaceae. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its unique, lantern-like flower heads that resemble small candles. The flowers are typically bright yellow or orange, and they are surrounded by a cup-like structure called a hypanthium. Hormopetalum species are often found in coastal and mountainous regions, thriving in well-drained soils. These plants are popular in gardens for their ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators."
