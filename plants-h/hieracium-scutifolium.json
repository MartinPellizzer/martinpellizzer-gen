    "intro": "Hieracium scutifolium, commonly known as the shield-leaf hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 50 centimeters. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a distinctive shield-like shape, and it produces yellow flowers in clusters. Hieracium scutifolium is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth habit."
