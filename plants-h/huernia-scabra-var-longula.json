    "intro": "Huernia scabra var. longula, commonly known as the horned ice plant, is a succulent species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its unique, ribbed, cylindrical stems that resemble horns, which help it store water in arid environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, which minimize water loss and protect it from herbivores. This species is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
