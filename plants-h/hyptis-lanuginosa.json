    "intro": "Hyptis lanuginosa, commonly known as velvetleaf hyptis, is a perennial herb native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its soft, hairy foliage and clusters of small, pale blue or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Hyptis lanuginosa is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid climates."
