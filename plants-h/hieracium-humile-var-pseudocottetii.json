    "intro": "Hieracium humile var. pseudocottetii, commonly known as the dwarf hawkweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically features basal rosettes of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its small size and adaptability, it is considered a common weed in certain regions."
