    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 amphibolum, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Hieracium auripigmentum and Hieracium piloselloides, resulting in a plant with intermediate characteristics. The species typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are often shorter than the central disk, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits genetic variability and can be challenging to classify botanically."
