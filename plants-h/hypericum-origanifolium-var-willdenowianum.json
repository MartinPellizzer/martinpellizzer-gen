    "intro": "Hypericum origanifolium var. willdenowianum, commonly known as the willdenow's St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typical of the Hypericaceae family. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture and a strong, aromatic scent. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. This variant is distinguished by its slightly larger leaves and more robust growth compared to the typical form of Hypericum origanifolium."
