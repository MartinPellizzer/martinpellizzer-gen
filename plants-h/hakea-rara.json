    "intro": "Hakea rara, commonly known as the rare hakea, is a shrub native to the south-western region of Western Australia. It is characterized by its woody structure and dense, needle-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant produces striking, urn-shaped flower spikes that range in color from yellow to red, depending on the species. Hakea rara is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with deep root systems that allow it to survive in dry conditions. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
