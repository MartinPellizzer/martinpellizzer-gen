    "intro": "Heterocondylus jaraguensis, commonly known as the Jaragua sedge, is a member of the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and rhizomatous growth habit. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly found in the humid lowland areas of the Dominican Republic. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy regions. Its leaves are linear and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its tropical habitat. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets, which are small and inconspicuous, typical of many sedges."
