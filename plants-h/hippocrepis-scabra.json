    "intro": "Hippocrepis scabra, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with characteristic cruciform flowers. The plant is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The rough hawksbeard is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is considered a hardy, low-maintenance plant in gardens."
