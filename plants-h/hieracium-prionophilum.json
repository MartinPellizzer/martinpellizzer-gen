    "intro": "Hieracium prionophilum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer months, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The leaves are lance-shaped with hairy surfaces, and the plant is often found in clusters."
