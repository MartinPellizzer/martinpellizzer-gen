    "intro": "Hieracium hyperephanum, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows to a height of up to 1.5 meters, featuring basal leaves that are lance-shaped and hairy. Its flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer, producing small seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium hyperephanum is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, and it can form dense stands that may outcompete native vegetation."
