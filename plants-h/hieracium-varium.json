    "intro": "Hieracium varium, commonly known as the variable hawkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat, disk-like cluster. Hieracium varium is known for its variability in leaf and flower morphology, which contributes to its common name."
