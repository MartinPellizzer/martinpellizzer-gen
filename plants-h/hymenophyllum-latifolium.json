    "intro": "Hymenophyllum latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaf filmy fern, is a delicate epiphytic fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its thin, translucent, and often curling fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sorangia, are borne on the underside of the fronds and are adapted for dispersal by wind. The species is notable for its intricate leaf structure and is often found in moist, shaded habitats across Southeast Asia and the Pacific."
