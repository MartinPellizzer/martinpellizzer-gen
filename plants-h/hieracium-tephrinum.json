    "intro": "Hieracium tephrinum, commonly known as the tephritic hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and a cluster of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. It has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in dry conditions. The plant is often found in open habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
