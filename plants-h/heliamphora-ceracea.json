    "intro": "Heliamphora ceracea, commonly known as the pitcher plant, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant's unique morphology includes a narrow neck and a wide, funnel-like opening that helps in capturing prey. It thrives in nutrient-poor, acidic soils and requires high humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Heliamphora ceracea plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to the local biodiversity."
