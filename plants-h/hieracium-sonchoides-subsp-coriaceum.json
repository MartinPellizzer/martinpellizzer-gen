    "intro": "Hieracium sonchoides subsp. coriaceum, commonly known as the woolly hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, hairy stems and basal rosettes of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The flowers are yellow, with ray florets and a central disk, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. The subspecies coriaceum is distinguished by its thick, leathery leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments."
