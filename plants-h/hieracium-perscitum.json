    "intro": "Hieracium perscitum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and basal rosette of leaves. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Hieracium perscitum is an invasive species in some areas, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
