    "intro": "Heliophila ephemera, commonly known as the transient sunflower, is a delicate annual herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. Heliophila ephemera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its short life cycle and ephemeral blooming period, it is a symbol of fleeting beauty in the botanical world."
