    "intro": "Haageocereus deflexispinus, commonly known as the twisted spine cactus, is a species native to Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its dense, spiny stems that often curve downward. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators. Its fleshy stems store water, allowing it to survive in arid environments. The plant's unique morphology makes it a striking addition to desert gardens."
