    "intro": "Hylogeton ursinum, commonly known as the bear's ear plant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of thick, fleshy, and hairy leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in early summer. Hylogeton ursinum thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
