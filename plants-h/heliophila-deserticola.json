    "intro": "Heliophila deserticola, commonly known as the desert heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes plants like carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its umbellate inflorescence. The plant has small, delicate white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adapted to attract pollinators in hot environments. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in a fine layer of hairs to reduce water loss. Heliophila deserticola is well-suited to sandy soils and can thrive in low-nutrient conditions."
