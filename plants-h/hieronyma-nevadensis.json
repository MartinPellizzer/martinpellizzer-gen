    "intro": "Hieronyma nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and Nevada, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are typically elliptical and have a leathery texture. It produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by small, round fruits. Hieronyma nevadensis is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
