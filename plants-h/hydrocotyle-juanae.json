It is a low-growing herb with a rosette of broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and rocky crevices. Hydrocotyle juanae is often found in wetland habitats and is adapted to tolerate periodic flooding."
