    "intro": "Hyptis asperrima, commonly known as rough hyptis, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or perennial herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are covered in stiff hairs, giving it a rough texture, and it produces showy inflorescences that attract pollinators. Hyptis asperrima is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
