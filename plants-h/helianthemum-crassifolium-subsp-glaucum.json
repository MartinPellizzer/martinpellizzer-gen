    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium subsp. glaucum, commonly known as the glaucous rock rose, is a low-growing, evergreen shrub native to southern Europe. It features dense, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a waxy, bluish-gray coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for drought-tolerant landscaping."
