    "intro": "Henckelia bakoensis var. tenuior, commonly known as the slender henckelia, is a rare and endemic plant species found primarily in the rainforests of Cameroon. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes a wide variety of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from habitat loss and climate change."
