    "intro": "Herniaria paniculata, commonly known as the sand pearl or sea sandwort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal cliffs, where it tolerates salt spray and strong winds. The plant features small, bright green, succulent-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of tiny white or pink flowers arranged in panicles. Herniaria paniculata is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and prevent erosion in harsh coastal environments."
