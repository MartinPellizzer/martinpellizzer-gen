    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. anolasium, commonly known as the Florentine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow-orange composite flowers in the summer. The plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in grasslands and disturbed soils. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it somewhat invasive in certain areas. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural practices."
