    "intro": "Hieracium eupristum, commonly known as the showy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its bright yellow flowers are surrounded by pale green bracts, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium eupristum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands."
