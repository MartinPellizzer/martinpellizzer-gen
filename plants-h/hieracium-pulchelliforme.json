It is characterized by its bright yellow daisy-like flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe, it is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. It is a perennial herb that can form dense colonies in suitable habitats."
