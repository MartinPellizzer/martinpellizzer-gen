    "intro": "Hapalorchis lineata var. brevicaulis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved water lily, is a aquatic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It features broad, floating leaves that are typically dark green with a waxy surface, aiding in water retention. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom at the water's surface, often in clusters. Its roots anchor it to the substrate, while its rhizomes spread horizontally to form dense colonies. This species is adapted to still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing aquatic ecosystems."
