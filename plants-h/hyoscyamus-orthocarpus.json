    "intro": "Hyoscyamus orthocarpus, commonly known as the greater thornapple, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its spiny stems and lobed leaves. The plant produces showy, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in summer, followed by orange or red berries. Hyoscyamus orthocarpus is known for containing tropane alkaloids, which have historically been used in medicine and as a source of hallucinogenic compounds. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and potentially toxic to livestock and humans."
