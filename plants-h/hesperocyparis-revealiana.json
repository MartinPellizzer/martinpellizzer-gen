    "intro": "Hesperocyparis revealiana, commonly known as the Revelian incense cedar, is a rare and endangered conifer native to the coastal regions of Oregon and California. It is characterized by its slender, pyramidal shape and scale-like leaves that are blue-green in color. The plant produces small, cone-like structures that contain wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal scrub and forest habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered one of the most critically endangered conifers in North America."
