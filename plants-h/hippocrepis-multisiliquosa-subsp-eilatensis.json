    "intro": "Hippocrepis multisiliquosa subsp. eilatensis, commonly known as the Eilat horseshoe vetch, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly found in Israel and Jordan. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, creeping stems and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant has palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its root system is adapted to thrive in arid and rocky environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing nectar for pollinators. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
