    "intro": "Henriettea hotteana, commonly known as the Hotte's henriettea, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Melanthiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters, with slender stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they emit a subtle fragrance that attracts pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Henriettea hotteana is considered an endangered species in its natural range."
