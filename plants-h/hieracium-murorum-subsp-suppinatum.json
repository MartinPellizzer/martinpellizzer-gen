    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. suppinatum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring moist and well-drained conditions. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are usually hairy and have a rough texture. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disk surrounded by ray florets, and it produces small, dry achenes as its seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and persistence."
