It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom from late spring to early summer. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions."
