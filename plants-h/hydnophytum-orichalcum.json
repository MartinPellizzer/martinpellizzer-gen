    "intro": "Hydnophytum orichalcum, commonly known as the golden mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from its host through specialized structures called haustoria. It is native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia and is often found growing on the branches of dipterocarp trees. The plant has small, elliptical leaves and produces yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a small, fleshy capsule that contains several seeds, which are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its habitat."
