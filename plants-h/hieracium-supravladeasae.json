    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium supravladeasae, commonly known as the Montseny hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to the Montseny massif in Catalonia, Spain. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowering stems are erect and bear small yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its mountainous habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered and is a subject of conservation efforts."
