    "intro": "Heteropetalum, commonly known as the mountain mahogany, is a genus of flowering plants in the rose family. It consists of shrubs and small trees native to North America, particularly in the western United States and parts of Canada. The plants typically have compound leaves with alternate arrangement and small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or white in color. The fruit is a follicle containing one or two seeds, and the genus is characterized by its aromatic foliage and drought-resistant properties. Heteropetalum species are valued for their ornamental value and ecological importance in arid and semi-arid environments."
