    "intro": "Hoffmannia steyermarkii, commonly known as the Steyermark's hoffmannia, is a species of flowering plant native to the highlands of Central America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in areas with high altitudes and cool temperatures. Its leaves are usually palmate, with three to five lobes, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hoffmannia steyermarkii is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
