It is characterized by its striking, crimson-colored bracts that surround its inflorescence, which resembles a spiral. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered within the bracts, and it thrives in warm, humid environments. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. The leaves are large, elongated, and have a waxy texture, contributing to its aesthetic appeal."
