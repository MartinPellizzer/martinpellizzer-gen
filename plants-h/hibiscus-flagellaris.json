    "intro": "Hibiscus flagellaris, commonly known as the creeping hibiscus, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warm seasons. Its foliage consists of heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. Hibiscus flagellaris is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adaptable to a variety of soil types."
