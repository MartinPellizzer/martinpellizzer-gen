    "intro": "Howardia sessilifolia, commonly known as the purple ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the humid forests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flowers that range in color from deep purple to almost black, giving it its common name. The plant has a short, stout stem and produces few, showy blooms that are often clustered at the base. Its leaves are narrow and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
