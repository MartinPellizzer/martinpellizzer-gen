It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble single flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers with ray florets, and its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette. It is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it can spread aggressively through rhizomes. Hieracium porrectum is also known for its medicinal properties, though it can be toxic in large quantities."
