    "intro": "Heteroblemma decurrens, commonly known as the creeping marshplant, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments. It features a prostrate growth habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pale green flowers arranged in spikes, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, often with a slightly hairy texture. Heteroblemma decurrens plays a role in stabilizing soil in wetland ecosystems and is often found in association with other aquatic and semi-aquatic plants."
