    "intro": "Hedysarum spirale, commonly known as the spiral vetch, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in open woodlands and grassy areas. The plant features slender, twining stems and small, pea-like flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. Its leaves are trifoliate, composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. Hedysarum spirale is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
