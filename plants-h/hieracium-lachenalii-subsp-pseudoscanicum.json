    "intro": "Hieracium lachenalii subsp. pseudoscanicum, commonly known as the false scandinavian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate leaves and yellowish flower heads. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and rocky slopes. It produces small, composite flowers that are visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in its native range."
