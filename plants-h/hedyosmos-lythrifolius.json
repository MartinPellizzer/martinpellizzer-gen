    "intro": "Hedyosmos lythrifolius, commonly known as the red-stemmed hedyosmos, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, reddish stems and small, clustered leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in spikes, typically blooming in late summer. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that split open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Hedyosmos lythrifolius is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments."
