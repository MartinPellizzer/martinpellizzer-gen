    "intro": "Hoya parasitica var. hendersonii, commonly known as the Henderson's wax plant, is a unique species within the Asclepiadaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on its host for nutrients while still performing some photosynthesis. The plant produces thick, fleshy stems and waxy, often fragrant leaves that help it retain moisture in its native habitat. It is native to Southeast Asia and is typically found growing on trees or shrubs. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive star-shaped appearance that attracts pollinators like moths and bees."
