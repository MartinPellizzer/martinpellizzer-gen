    "intro": "Heliamphora collina, commonly known as the Pitcher Plant of the Andes, is a carnivorous plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela. It is characterized by its unique, pitcher-shaped leaves that secrete a digestive fluid to trap and digest insects. The plant thrives in high-altitude, humid environments with poor soil conditions. Its pitchers are typically green or reddish in color and can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. Heliamphora collina plays an important ecological role in its habitat by controlling insect populations and contributing to nutrient cycling."
