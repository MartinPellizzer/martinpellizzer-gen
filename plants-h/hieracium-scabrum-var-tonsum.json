It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rough, hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and garden settings."
