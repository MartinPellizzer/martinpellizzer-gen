It is native to various regions of Africa, southern Europe, and the Middle East, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage and showy yellow flowers. The leaves are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a silvery appearance, while the flowers are small and clustered in a composite head. Homognaphalium species are often found in dry, rocky, or sandy soils and are adapted to arid environments. These plants are sometimes used in horticulture for their ornamental value and drought tolerance."
