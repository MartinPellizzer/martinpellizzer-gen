    "intro": "Hedypnois polymorpha subsp. cretica, commonly known as the Cretan hedypnois, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Crete. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its aromatic foliage and umbellate inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in dry and sunny habitats. Its leaves are finely divided and emit a strong, spicy scent when crushed. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
