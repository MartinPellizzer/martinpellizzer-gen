It is characterized by its compound leaves with a distinctive reticulate venation pattern. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by hard, woody pods that contain seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
