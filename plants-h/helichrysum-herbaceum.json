    "intro": "Helichrysum herbaceum, commonly known as the everlasting daisy, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to produce long-lasting, golden-yellow flowers that retain their color even after drying. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and borders. Helichrysum herbaceum is also valued in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties."
