    "intro": "Habenaria supplicans, commonly known as the sacred ghost orchid, is a rare and enigmatic orchid species native to the tropical regions of South and Central America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, ghost-like flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often clustered at the base of the plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
