    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium subsp. verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered cowparsnip, is a member of the Apiaceae family characterized by its tall, branched stems and large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into fluffy, white seeds. It is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in wetlands, where it can form dense stands. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a potentially harmful plant to handle without protective gear."
