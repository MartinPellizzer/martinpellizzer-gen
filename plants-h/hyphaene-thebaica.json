It has compound leaves that are long and feather-like, and its trunk is covered in a fibrous, spongy material. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into edible dates. Its roots are adapted to thrive in arid environments, making it well-suited for desert conditions. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appearance and its ability to provide shade and shelter."
