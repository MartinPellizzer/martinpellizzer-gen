    "intro": "Hordeum pyramidatum, commonly known as the mountain barley or pyramid grass, is a perennial grass native to the mountainous regions of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, wind-pollinated flowers, which are typically green or pale yellow in color. Hordeum pyramidatum thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
