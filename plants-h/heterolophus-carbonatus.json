    "intro": "Heterolophus carbonatus, commonly known as the blackleaf dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer, followed by fluffy, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland habitats. Due to its unique appearance and ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
