    "intro": "Humularia flabelliformis, commonly known as the fan-leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, fan-shaped fronds that can reach up to 2 meters in length. The plant has a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread along the forest floor. Its leaves are compound, with numerous small, serrated leaflets arranged in a feather-like pattern. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests."
