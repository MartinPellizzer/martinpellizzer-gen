    "intro": "Helianthemum salicifolium subsp. trifoliatum, commonly known as the three-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub with small, evergreen leaves that are often trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three parts. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous areas. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
