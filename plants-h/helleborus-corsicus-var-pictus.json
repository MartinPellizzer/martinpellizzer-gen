    "intro": "Helleborus corsicus var. pictus, commonly known as the Corsican hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves with distinctive white or pale markings, which give it its varietal name \"pictus,\" meaning \"painted.\" The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, dark purple to black flowers during late winter to early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is often cultivated for both aesthetic and traditional uses."
