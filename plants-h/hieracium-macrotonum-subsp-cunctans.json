    "intro": "Hieracium macrotonum subsp. cunctans, commonly known as the delayed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and eastern Europe. It typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with stems that are hairy and often reddish in color. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence and bloom from June to August. The subspecies is distinguished by its delayed flowering and shorter, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
