    "intro": "Hieracium chlorifolium subsp. fulcratiforme, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical structure supports its role as a pioneer species in ecological succession."
