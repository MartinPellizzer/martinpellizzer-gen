    "intro": "Hemigymnia malabarica, commonly known as the Malabar banyan, is a tropical tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Moraceae and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive aerial roots. The plant exhibits hemiepiphytic growth, meaning it starts life as an epiphyte on other plants before establishing its own roots in the soil. It produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruit is a syncarpous, three-lobed structure containing one or two seeds. This species plays an important ecological role in its habitat, providing shelter and food for various wildlife species."
