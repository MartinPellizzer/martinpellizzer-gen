    "intro": "Humboltia fuegi, commonly known as the Magellan's tree or the Chilean rosewood, is a flowering plant native to southern Chile and Argentina. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is characterized by its large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant has a woody stem and produces small, round, red fruits that contain one or two seeds. Humboltia fuegi is valued for its dense, dark wood, which has been historically used in furniture and musical instruments. However, due to overharvesting, it is now considered a vulnerable species."
