    "intro": "Hekorima dichotoma, commonly known as the forked bush, is a shrub native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its branching structure, with stems that split into two at the base, giving it its scientific name. The plant has small, narrow leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in hot, dry environments. It produces clusters of white or pale yellow flowers during the rainy season, which attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. Hekorima dichotoma is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
