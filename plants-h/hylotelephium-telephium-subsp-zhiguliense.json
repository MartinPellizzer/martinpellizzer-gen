    "intro": "Hylotelephium telephium subsp. zhiguliense, commonly known as the Zhiguli stonecrop, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of China. It features fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically green with a reddish tinge, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces showy clusters of pink or red flowers in the summer, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
