It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are typically arranged in a flat-topped cluster. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its hairy foliage and robust growth, it is somewhat invasive in certain regions."
