    "intro": "Helwingia zhejiangensis, commonly known as the Zhejiang helwingia, is a rare evergreen shrub native to China. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and showy, red bracts that resemble flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as mountain forests, and is adapted to cool, humid climates. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and requires protection to ensure its survival."
