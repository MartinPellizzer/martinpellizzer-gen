    "intro": "Hieracium sonchoides subsp. mairei, commonly known as the Maire's hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. The plant features basal rosettes of leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head, which are surrounded by phyllaries. It has a taproot system and is often found in temperate climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flower heads and more compact growth habit compared to other Hieracium species."
