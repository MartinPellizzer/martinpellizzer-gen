    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobocconei, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas and disturbed soils, exhibiting a robust growth habit with hairy stems and broad, lance-shaped leaves. Its yellow flowers bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
