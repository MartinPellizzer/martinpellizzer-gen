    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. erigerontinum, commonly known as the erect hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads made up of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring hairy stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped with serrated edges. Its showy yellow flowers appear in late spring to early summer, and it thrives in disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
