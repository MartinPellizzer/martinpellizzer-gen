    "intro": "Hoya flexuosa, commonly known as the hanging hoya or the wax plant, is a tropical vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its waxy, ovate leaves that are typically green with a slight variegation. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, which bloom during the summer months. Hoya flexuosa is a climbing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular among indoor gardeners for its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
