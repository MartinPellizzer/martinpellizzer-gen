    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hakea calchilena, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, woody spikes of small white or pale pink flowers, which appear in spring. Hakea calchilena is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. It plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and nectar for native wildlife."
