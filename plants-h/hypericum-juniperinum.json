It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The plant has oval-shaped, dark green leaves that are slightly hairy beneath. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its medicinal properties have been studied for their potential anti-inflammatory and antidepressant effects."
