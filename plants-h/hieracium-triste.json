    "intro": "Hieracium triste, commonly known as the weeping hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has hairy, alternate leaves that are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it can outcompete native vegetation if not managed carefully."
