    "intro": "Hieracium pseudosemisilvaticum, commonly known as the false wood sorrel, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and is characterized by its small, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland areas and has a creeping growth habit. It produces achenes as its seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Due to its delicate appearance, it is often mistaken for other similar species within the Hieracium genus."
