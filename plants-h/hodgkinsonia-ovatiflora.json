    "intro": "Hodgkinsonia ovatiflora, commonly known as the broad-leaved Hodgkinsonia, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, ovate leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, blooming during the wet season. Hodgkinsonia ovatiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a threatened species in the wild."
