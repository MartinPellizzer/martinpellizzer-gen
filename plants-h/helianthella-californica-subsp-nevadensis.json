    "intro": "Helianthella californica subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Nevada helianthella, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as meadows and slopes, and is well adapted to arid environments. It produces small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, and its leaves are narrow and hairy, providing a drought-resistant structure. This subspecies is often found in California and Nevada, where it contributes to local biodiversity and ecological stability."
