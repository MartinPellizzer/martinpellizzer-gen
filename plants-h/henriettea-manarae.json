    "intro": "Henriettea manarae, commonly known as the Manarae's henriettea, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and succulent-like leaves. The plant exhibits a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky substrates. Its flowers are typically yellow or greenish-yellow, with a unique structure that resembles a cupule. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Henriettea manarae is considered a species of conservation concern."
