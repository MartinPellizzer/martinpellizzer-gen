It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and stems that bear yellow to orange flowers. The leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers are arranged in dense, compact clusters. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and grasslands. This subspecies is notable for its distinctive leaf morphology and is often found in calcareous soils."
