    "intro": "Helianthemum alyssoides, commonly known as the rock rose or alpine rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically clustered in racemes along the stems. The plant has hirsute, glandular leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in water retention in its arid habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure. Helianthemum alyssoides is often used in rock gardens and alpine landscapes due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
