    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. pervirens, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and meadows, across temperate regions of Europe. It has finely divided leaves and produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. Due to its invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
