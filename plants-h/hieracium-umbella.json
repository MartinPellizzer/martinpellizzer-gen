    "intro": "Hieracium umbella, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow flowers that bloom in a flat-topped cluster, known as an umbel. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and leaves that are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges. Hieracium umbella is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
