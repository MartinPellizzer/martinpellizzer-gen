    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracesium pichleri subsp. pseudadamovicii, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, demonstrating a strong adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Its subspecies status reflects subtle morphological and genetic distinctions from other Hieracium species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
