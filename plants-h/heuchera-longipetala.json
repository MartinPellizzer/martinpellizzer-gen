    "intro": "Heuchera longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, often variegated leaves that display a range of colors from deep purples to bright greens. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in early to mid-summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Heuchera longipetala is also valued for its ornamental foliage and its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
