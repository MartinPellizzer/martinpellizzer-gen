    "intro": "Hedysarum songaricum var. urumqiense, commonly known as the Urumqi milkvetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to central Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in steppe and semi-desert environments. Due to its ability to fix nitrogen, it plays a role in soil enrichment and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
