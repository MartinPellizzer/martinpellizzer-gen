    "intro": "Hemiperis simplex, commonly known as the lesser candleplant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves that remain throughout the year, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Hemiperis simplex is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
