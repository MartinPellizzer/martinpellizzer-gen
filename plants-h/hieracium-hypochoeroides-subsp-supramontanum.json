    "intro": "Hieracium hypochoeroides subsp. supramontanum, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that attract pollinators. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the stems are erect and often branched. This subspecies is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, making it a resilient member of alpine flora."
