    "intro": "Hebeclinium beneolens, commonly known as the silver leaf hebe, is a rare and delicate plant native to the high-altitude regions of New Zealand. It features narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of violet and blue, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
