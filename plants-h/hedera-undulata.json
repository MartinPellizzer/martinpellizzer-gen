It features dark green, wavy-edged leaves that are typically heart-shaped or ovate in form. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by bright red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera undulata thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental landscaping. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for vertical gardening and ground cover."
