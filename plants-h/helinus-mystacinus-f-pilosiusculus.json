    "intro": "Helinus mystacinus f. pilosiusculus, commonly known as the silky helinus, is a rare and unique fern species native to specific regions of New Zealand. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silky-textured fronds that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures are small and clustered, contributing to its limited distribution. Due to its habitat specificity and rarity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
