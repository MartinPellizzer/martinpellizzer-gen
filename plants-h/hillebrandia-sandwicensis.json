    "intro": "Hillebrandia sandwicensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ghost flower, is a rare and unique plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a member of the orchid family and is characterized by its small, pale greenish-white flowers that bloom at night. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on other plants without being parasitic, typically on trees in the rainforest canopy. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor, which attracts specific pollinators like flies. Due to habitat loss and introduced species, it is critically endangered and listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act."
