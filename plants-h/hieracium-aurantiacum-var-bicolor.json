    "intro": "Hieracium aurantiacum var. bicolor, commonly known as the two-colored hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and hairy, while the flowers display a striking combination of orange and yellow hues. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
