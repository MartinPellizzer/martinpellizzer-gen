    "intro": "Hieracium anfracticeps, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant features hairy, upright stems and basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine pubescence. Its flowers are yellow and arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It is often considered a weed but can play a role in soil stabilization and habitat for small invertebrates."
