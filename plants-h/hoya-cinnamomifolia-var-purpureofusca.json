It features thick, waxy leaves that are typically deep green with a purple or reddish underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. This variety is popular among succulent and tropical plant enthusiasts for its aesthetic appeal and ease of care."
