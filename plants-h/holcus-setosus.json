    "intro": "Holcus setosus, commonly known as the hairy bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as meadows and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet, which is usually upright and bears small, spike-like flowers. Holcus setosus is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and support local biodiversity."
