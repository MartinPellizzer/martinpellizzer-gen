    "intro": "Helichrysum \u00d7 selago var. acutum, commonly known as the sharp leaf everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and dense clusters of small, yellow-orange flower heads. The plant produces bracteate involucres that are often mistaken for flowers, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its foliage consists of narrow, linear to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting blooms."
