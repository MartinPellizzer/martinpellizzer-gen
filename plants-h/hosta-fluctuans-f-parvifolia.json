    "intro": "Hosta fluctuans f. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf fluctuating hosta, is a compact, ornamental plant native to Japan. It features heart-shaped leaves that are smaller and more delicate compared to typical hosta varieties, with a smooth, waxy texture. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale blue flowers on slender stems, adding visual interest in late summer. Its foliage exhibits a striking color change, ranging from chartreuse in spring to deep green in summer. This cultivar is well-suited for shaded gardens and is prized for its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
