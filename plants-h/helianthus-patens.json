It is a herbaceous perennial that produces yellow ray flowers and brown disk flowers, typical of the Asteraceae family. The plant has slender, trailing stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Helianthus patens typically blooms from late spring to early fall, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
