    "intro": "Helenium nudiflorum var. purpureum, commonly known as the purple swamp lily, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its striking purple to pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in wet, swampy habitats and has narrow, grass-like leaves. Its botanical name reflects its naked flower buds, which are visible before the flowers open. The plant is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in moist environments."
