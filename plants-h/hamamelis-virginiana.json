    "intro": "Hamamelis virginiana, commonly known as the common witch-hazel, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late autumn or early winter. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that turn reddish in the fall, adding to its seasonal appeal. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, often peeling in thin layers. Hamamelis virginiana is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
