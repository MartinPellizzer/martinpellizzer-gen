    "intro": "Hieracium pauradenium, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands, wastelands, and disturbed soils. The plant features a basal rosette of spiny, gray-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and are arranged in a dense, cylindrical head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It is often considered a weed but has ecological value in supporting pollinators."
