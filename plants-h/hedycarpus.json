    "intro": "Hedycarpus, commonly known as the velvetleaf or sacred lotus, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae. These plants are characterized by their large, showy spathes that enclose the inflorescence, often with a distinctive, waxy texture. Hedycarpus species are native to Southeast Asia, particularly the Himalayas and tropical regions of India. They typically grow as herbaceous perennials or shrubs, with some species developing into trees. The genus is notable for its ornamental value and ecological significance in moist, shaded habitats."
