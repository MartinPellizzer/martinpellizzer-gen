    "intro": "Helichrysum isolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom in winter. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its fibrous roots help prevent soil erosion, and it is often used in traditional medicine. The plant's common name reflects its long-lasting, dried flower heads that retain their color and form."
