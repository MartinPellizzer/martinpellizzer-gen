    "intro": "Hieracium niederleinii var. subcatamarcense, commonly known as the subcatamarcense hawkweed, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions in South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
