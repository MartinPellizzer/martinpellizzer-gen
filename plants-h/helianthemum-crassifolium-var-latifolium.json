    "intro": "Helianthemum crassifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in sunny, well-drained environments. The plant features fleshy, dark green leaves that are broader than those of the typical variety, and it produces showy yellow flowers in the spring. Its succulent nature helps it survive in arid conditions, and it is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant. The species is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in horticultural settings."
