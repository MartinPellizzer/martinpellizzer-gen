It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellowish to orange flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its elliptical, hairy pappus and the shape of its involucral bracts. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides.
