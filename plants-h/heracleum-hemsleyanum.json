    "intro": "Heracleum hemsleyanum, commonly known as the Chinese cow parsnip, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its large, compound leaves and tall, branched flowering stems. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
