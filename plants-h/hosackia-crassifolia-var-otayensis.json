    "intro": "Hosackia crassifolia var. otayensis, commonly known as the Otay mountain milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of Southern California and Baja California. It is a perennial herb characterized by its robust, hairy stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to full sun, making it a common sight in desert and chaparral habitats. Due to its limited range and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
