    "intro": "Habenaria pilosa var. kabompoensis, commonly known as the Kabompo hairy orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It features a rhizomatous growth habit with dense, hairy leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces showy, greenish-yellow to brownish flowers arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, typically in forest understories. Its unique morphology and restricted distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
