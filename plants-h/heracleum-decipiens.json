    "intro": "Heracleum decipiens, commonly known as the deceptive hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescences. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall, with hollow, ridged stems and large, pinnately compound leaves. Its flowers are small and greenish-yellow, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces small, dry fruits known as schizocarps. The plant contains phototoxic compounds, making it potentially harmful to humans and animals if skin is exposed to sunlight after contact."
