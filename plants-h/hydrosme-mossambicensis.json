    "intro": "Hydrosme mossambicensis, commonly known as the Mozambique water moss, is a rare aquatic moss found in freshwater habitats across sub-Saharan Africa. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters, often growing on submerged rocks or logs. The plant has a dense, tufted growth form with filamentous leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
