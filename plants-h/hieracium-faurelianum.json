    "intro": "Hieracium faurelianum, commonly known as the Faurelian hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow to orange flowers and basal rosettes of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. Native to Europe and parts of western Asia, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant is perennial and often found in meadows, pastures, and along stream banks. Its fibrous root system and rapid growth make it a competitive species in its native habitat."
