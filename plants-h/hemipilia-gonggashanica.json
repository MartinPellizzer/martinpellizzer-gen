    "intro": "Hemipilia gonggashanica, commonly known as the Gongga Mountain hemipilia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in forest understories at high altitudes. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a rosette pattern, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
