    "intro": "Hieracium actinotum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are hairy and often covered in fine white pubescence. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are usually shorter than the central disk florets. Hieracium actinotum is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites, and it can form dense colonies due to its rhizomatous growth habit."
