    "intro": "Hakea aneura, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring. These flowers are followed by woody, cone-like fruits that contain seeds. Hakea aneura is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient plant in harsh conditions."
