    "intro": "Hieracium orbiculare, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rough, hairy texture, and the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium orbiculare is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
