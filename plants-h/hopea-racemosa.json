It belongs to the Dipterocarpaceae family and is characterized by its dense, heavy wood that is highly valued for its strength and durability. The plant has compound leaves with alternate arrangement, and its flowers are typically small and clustered in racemes. It produces small, winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal by wind.
