It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
