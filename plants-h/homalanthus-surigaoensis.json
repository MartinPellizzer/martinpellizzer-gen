It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
