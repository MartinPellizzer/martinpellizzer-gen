    "intro": "Hermione angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf Hermione, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features slender, upright stems with lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, blooming in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
