    "intro": "Hakea involucrata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces cylindrical, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting nectar-feeding birds and insects. Its woody stems and dense foliage make it well adapted to dry, sandy soils. Hakea involucrata is often used in landscaping due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
