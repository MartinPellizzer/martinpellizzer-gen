    "intro": "Hierochloe dahurica, commonly known as Siberian grass or mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in alpine and subarctic regions, often forming dense mats on rocky or barren soils. The plant has slender, wiry stems and small, needle-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It produces slender, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Hierochloe dahurica is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for small animals and insects."
