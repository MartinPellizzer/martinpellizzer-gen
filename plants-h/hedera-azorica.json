It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves and rapid growth habit. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments and is often found growing on cliffs and rocky outcrops. Its adaptability to coastal conditions makes it a unique example of plant life in the Azores.
