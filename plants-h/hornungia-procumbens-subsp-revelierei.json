    "intro": "Hornungia procumbens subsp. revelierei, commonly known as the Reveliere's hornungia, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of pale pink to white flowers. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution and specialized environment, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
