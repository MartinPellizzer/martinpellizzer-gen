It is a perennial herb characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, clustered yellow flowers. The plant produces a distinctive pappus, which is a feathery structure that aids in seed dispersal. It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic study."
