    "intro": "Hydrangea scandens subsp. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Ryukyu hydrangea, is a flowering plant native to the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its climbing habit and large, showy inflorescences. The flowers, which can be blue, pink, or white, depend on soil pH, a trait common among hydrangeas. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into white or pink berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening."
