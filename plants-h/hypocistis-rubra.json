    "intro": "Hypocistis rubra, commonly known as the red-edged leafminer, is a species of moth in the family Gracillariidae. It is characterized by its small size and distinctive red edges on its wings. The larvae of this species feed on the leaves of various plants, primarily those in the genus Prunus, such as cherries and plums. The plant's botanical significance lies in its role as a host for these larvae, influencing local ecosystems. Its life cycle is closely tied to the seasonal growth patterns of its host plants."
