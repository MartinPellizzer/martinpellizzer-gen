    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. acrophyes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often growing on rocky or gravelly soils. It has adapted to cold climates with a short growing season and is often found in mountainous areas. Its subspecies status reflects genetic differentiation from other forms of Hieracium niphobium."
