It is native to southern Africa and is characterized by its grass-like leaves and clusters of small, star-shaped flowers. Hypoxis species are often found in rocky or sandy soils and are adapted to dry, arid environments. The plants are perennial and typically grow in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands. They are also popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ease of cultivation."
