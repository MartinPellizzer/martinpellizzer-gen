    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subconjungens, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, while its flowers are arranged in a single head at the tip of each stem. The subspecies subconjungens is distinguished by its shorter flower stems and more compact growth habit compared to other forms of Hieracium murorum."
