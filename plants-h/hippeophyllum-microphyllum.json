    "intro": "Hippeophyllum microphyllum, commonly known as the small-leaved evergreen, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, leathery leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by distinctive red or orange berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
