    "intro": "Hakea mollis, commonly known as the silver wattle, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, silver-gray leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Hakea mollis is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for dry gardens. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract native pollinators."
