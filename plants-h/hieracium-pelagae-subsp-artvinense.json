    "intro": "Hieracium pelagae subsp. artvinense, commonly known as the Artvin hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Turkey. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its daisy-like yellow flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered with fine, white hairs, which help reduce water loss. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to its harsh habitat."
