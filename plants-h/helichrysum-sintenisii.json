It is characterized by its dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny suns. The plant produces papery, wind-dispersed seeds, which aid in its propagation across arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suitable for dry climates. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a decorative plant in floral arrangements."
