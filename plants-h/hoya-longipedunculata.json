    "intro": "Hoya longipedunculata, commonly known as the Long-stemmed Wax Plant, is a species of epiphytic flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are often variegated with shades of green, white, and pink. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink, emerging from long, pendant-like peduncles. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya longipedunculata is popular among succulent enthusiasts for its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
