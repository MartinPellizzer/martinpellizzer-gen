    "intro": "Helianthus lehmannii, commonly known as Lehmann's sunflower, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and arid environments. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers, which are characteristic of the sunflower genus. Its leaves are generally lance-shaped and covered in a fine layer of hairs, aiding in water retention. Lehmann's sunflower is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
