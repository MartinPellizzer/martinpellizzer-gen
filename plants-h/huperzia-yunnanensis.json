    "intro": "Huperzia yunnanensis, commonly known as Yunnan clubmoss, is a species of lycophyte native to China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, scale-like leaves arranged in whorls around the stem. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest environments, often forming dense mats on rocky or soil substrates. It produces spore-bearing cones at the tips of its stems, which are clustered in spherical structures. Huperzia yunnanensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
