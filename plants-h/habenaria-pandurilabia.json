    "intro": "Habenaria pandurilabia, commonly known as the pandurilabia orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest floors or mountainous regions. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though its primary botanical interest lies in its floral structure and pollination mechanisms. The species is notable for its unique labellum, which plays a crucial role in attracting specific pollinators."
