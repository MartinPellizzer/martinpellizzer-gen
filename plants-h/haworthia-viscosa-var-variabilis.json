It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with white or yellowish markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for rock gardens and indoor collections."
