    "intro": "Habenaria montis-wilhelminae, commonly known as the Wilhelmine's Orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the mountainous regions of Central Africa. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom during the wet season. The plant has a complex root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It is often found in shaded, moist habitats such as forests and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
