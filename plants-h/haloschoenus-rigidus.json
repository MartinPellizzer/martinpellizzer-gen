    "intro": "Haloschoenus rigidus, commonly known as the rigid spike-rush, is a perennial grass-like plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its stiff, upright stems and narrow, grass-like leaves, which are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. This plant is often found in wetland habitats, including marshes and swampy areas, where it thrives in moist to water-saturated soils. Haloschoenus rigidus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
