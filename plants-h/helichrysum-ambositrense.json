    "intro": "Helichrysum ambositrense, commonly known as the yellow everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, daisy-like flowers that remain intact even after blooming. The plant produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind, aiding in its propagation. Its leaves are narrow and gray-green, often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Helichrysum ambositrense is often used in dried floral arrangements due to its long-lasting, vibrant color."
