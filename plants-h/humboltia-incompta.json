    "intro": "Humboltia incompta, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has a woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are adapted to conserve water in dry environments. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Humboltia incompta is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to desert and semi-arid habitats."
