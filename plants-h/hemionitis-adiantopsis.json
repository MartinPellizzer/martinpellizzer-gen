    "intro": "Hemionitis adiantopsis, commonly known as the water fern, is a rare and delicate aquatic plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It thrives in shallow, freshwater environments with high light exposure and moderate water movement. The plant has finely divided, feather-like fronds that are typically submerged, with some leaves extending just above the water surface. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the fern family. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, Hemionitis adiantopsis is considered endangered and is often found in protected natural reserves."
