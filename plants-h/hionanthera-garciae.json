    "intro": "Hionanthera garciae, commonly known as the Garcia's hionanthera, is a rare flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Colombia. It belongs to the Melastomataceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hionanthera garciae is considered a critically endangered species."
