    "intro": "Hieracium pertactum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and fibrous root system. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with dark green, hairy leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain regions."
