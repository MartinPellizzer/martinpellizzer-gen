    "intro": "Heynea trijuga f. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy three-angled sumac, is a shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in fine pubescence, giving it a distinctive hairy appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in catkins, followed by red, berry-like drupes. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
