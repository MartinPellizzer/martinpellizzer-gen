    "intro": "Helianthemum \u00d7 pseudodianicum, commonly known as the hybrid rockrose, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in spring, typically in clusters at the ends of its branched stems. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in well-drained, sandy or rocky soils and is drought-tolerant once established. This species is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
