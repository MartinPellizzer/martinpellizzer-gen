    "intro": "Hypericum philonotis, commonly known as the narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Hypericaceae. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in mountainous regions. It is native to parts of Europe and western Asia, and it has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. Its name is derived from the Greek words \"hyperion\" meaning \"above the sun\" and \"kynos\" meaning \"dog,\" possibly referring to its growth habit or appearance."
