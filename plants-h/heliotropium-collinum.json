    "intro": "Heliotropium collinum, commonly known as the mountain heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the Americas. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in dry, disturbed soils and rocky habitats. The plant features opposite, hairy leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to purple. Its flowers open in the morning and close in the evening, a behavior known as nyctinasty. Heliotropium collinum is often found in arid regions and is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient environments."
