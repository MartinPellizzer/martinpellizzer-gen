    "intro": "Helichrysum arenarium var. ponticum, commonly known as the sand everlasting or golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and its ability to thrive in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after the leaves have dried, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is drought-tolerant and often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to other regions for horticultural purposes."
