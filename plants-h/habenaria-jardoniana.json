    "intro": "[WRONG START] Habenaria jargoniana, commonly known as the Jard\u00f3n's orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in rocky or forested areas. Its flowers are usually short-lived, blooming during the cooler months of the year. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
