    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. calodes, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. The plant thrives in rocky and open habitats, often at high altitudes where conditions are harsh. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, more compact growth form compared to other members of the Hieracium genus."
