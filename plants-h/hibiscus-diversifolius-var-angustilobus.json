    "intro": "Hibiscus diversifolius var. angustilobus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as swamps and marshes, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. It produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small, black seeds. Hibiscus diversifolius var. angustilobus is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
