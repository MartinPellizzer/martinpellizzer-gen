    "intro": "Hedyosmum toxicum, commonly known as the poisonwood tree, is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its dense, aromatic foliage and small, white flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its bark and leaves, which can cause severe health issues if ingested. It is often found in moist, shaded areas of rainforests and is valued for its medicinal properties in traditional practices. However, due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is not commonly cultivated."
