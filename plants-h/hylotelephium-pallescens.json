    "intro": "Hylotelephium pallescens, commonly known as the silver rose or ghost flower, is a perennial succulent native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, gray-green leaves that form a dense rosette. The plant produces clusters of small, pink to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Hylotelelephium pallescens is also valued for its cold hardiness and ability to bloom reliably in USDA zones 5 through 8."
