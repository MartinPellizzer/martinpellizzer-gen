It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in rocky or calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
