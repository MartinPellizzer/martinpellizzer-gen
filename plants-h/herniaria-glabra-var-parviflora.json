    "intro": "Herniaria glabra var. parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to dry, sandy soils in coastal and inland areas. It belongs to the family Crambeae and is characterized by its small, rounded leaves and tiny, clustered flowers. The plant is often found in disturbed or nutrient-poor environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its unique morphology includes bladder-like structures that may aid in water retention. This variety is notable for its ability to colonize harsh habitats, contributing to soil stabilization and ecological diversity."
