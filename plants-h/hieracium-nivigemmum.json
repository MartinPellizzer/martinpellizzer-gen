    "intro": "Hieracium nivigemmum, commonly known as the snow gem dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single bloom. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, often covered in a white, woolly covering that gives it its common name. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
