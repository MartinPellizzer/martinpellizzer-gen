    "intro": "Hieracium murrianum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow-orange composite flowers. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. It has a fibrous root system and produces numerous small, seed-like achenes that are dispersed by wind. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
