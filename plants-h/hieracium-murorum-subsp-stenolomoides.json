It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lanceolate, with a rough, hairy texture, and its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat, disc-like cluster. It is often found in areas with poor to moderate soil, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
