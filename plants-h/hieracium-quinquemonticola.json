    "intro": "Hieracium quinquemonticola, commonly known as the five-mountain hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. It produces small, yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Hieracium quinquemonticola is known for its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its arid environment."
