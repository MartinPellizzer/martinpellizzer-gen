    "intro": "Hylebia montana, commonly known as the mountain hylebia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central and South America. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or well-drained soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, while its flowers are small and clustered in dense, spherical heads. Hylebia montana is known for its resilience to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to survive."
