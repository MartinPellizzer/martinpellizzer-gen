    "intro": "Holosteum glutinosum, commonly known as sticky false nettle, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky areas. The plant has opposite, ovate leaves with a sticky, glandular surface that gives it its common name. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits that are dispersed by wind. Holosteum glutinosum is valued in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
