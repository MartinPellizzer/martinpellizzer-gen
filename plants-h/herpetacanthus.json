    "intro": "Herpetacanthus, commonly known as the horned violets, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Violaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive, horn-like structures on their leaves, which give them their common name. They are native to tropical regions of Africa and are often found in moist, shaded environments. Herpetacanthus species typically produce small, showy flowers in shades of purple or violet. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
