    "intro": "Humulus americanus, commonly known as hops, is a flowering plant native to North America. It is characterized by its vigorous climbing growth habit and its distinctive cone-like flowers, which are used in brewing beer. The plant contains resins and essential oils that contribute to its aromatic and bitter properties. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a rough texture, while its stems are fibrous and covered in fine hairs. Humulus americanus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
