    "intro": "Heterotheca latifolia var. arkansana, commonly known as the Arkansas aster, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its showy, violet-blue flower heads that bloom in late summer to early fall. The plant typically grows in moist soils along stream banks and wet meadows, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. This variety is notable for its ecological value, providing nectar for pollinators and serving as a host plant for certain butterfly species."
