    "intro": "Hydrocotyle capitata, commonly known as the water pennywort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wetlands. The plant has a rosette of glossy, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface, with smaller leaves submerged beneath. It produces small, white or yellowish flowers that bloom above the water, often in late summer. Hydrocotyle capitata is often used in water gardens and is valued for its ornamental appearance and ability to help control algae growth."
