    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chilensis, commonly known as the Chilean water shield, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves, which are typically rounded and have a waxy surface. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its small white flowers are usually borne on short stalks and bloom in the summer months. Hydrocotyle chilensis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
