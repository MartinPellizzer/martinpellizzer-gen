    "intro": "Hippocrepis scabra var. rupestris, commonly known as the rough scabious, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in coastal areas and along cliffs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue or purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually rough and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. It is valued in gardens for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
