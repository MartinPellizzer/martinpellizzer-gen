It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes plants such as philodendrons and peace lilies. The plant has a climbing habit, with aerial roots that help it attach to supports as it grows. Its flowers are small and clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, which is enclosed by a modified leaf called a spathe. The plant is native to Southeast Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
