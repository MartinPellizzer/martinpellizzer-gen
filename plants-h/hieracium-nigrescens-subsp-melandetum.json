It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its dark purple to black central flower head, which contrasts with its yellow or orange ray florets. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its leaves are lanceolate and hairy, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. It is often found in alpine and subalpine regions, where it thrives in cooler, moist environments."
