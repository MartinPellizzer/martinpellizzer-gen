    "intro": "Habenaria aranifera, commonly known as the spider orchid, is a species of orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and its striking, spider-like flowers that are typically white or pale pink. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a dense spike, which can resemble a spider's web. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forests or along stream banks. The orchid is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for horticultural purposes."
