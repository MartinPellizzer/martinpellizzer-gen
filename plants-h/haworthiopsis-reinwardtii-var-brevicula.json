    "intro": "Haworthiopsis reinwardtii var. brevicula, commonly known as the miniature Haworthia, is a compact, slow-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features dense rosettes of thick, fleshy, blue-green leaves with white to pale yellow markings. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water. Due to its unique appearance and low maintenance, it is a popular choice for indoor and rock garden settings."
