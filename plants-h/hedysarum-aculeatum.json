It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, hairy pods that contain several elliptical seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry grasslands and rocky habitats. Hedysarum aculeatum is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it useful in soil enrichment and ecological restoration projects."
