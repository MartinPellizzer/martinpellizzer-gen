    "intro": "Haplopappus breviradiatus, commonly known as the short-rayed pappus, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its small, yellowish flowers are followed by a unique, fluffy pappus that aids in seed dispersal. The botanical features of Haplopappus breviradiatus make it well adapted to its harsh, dry habitat."
