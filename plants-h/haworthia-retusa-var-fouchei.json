    "intro": "Haworthia retusa var. fouchei, commonly known as the Fouche's Haworthia, is a compact, evergreen succulent native to South Africa. It features a rosette of thick, fleshy leaves that are typically pale green with distinct white or yellow markings. The leaves are densely packed and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its low maintenance and unique appearance."
