    "intro": "Hieracium polycharactum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom in summer, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
