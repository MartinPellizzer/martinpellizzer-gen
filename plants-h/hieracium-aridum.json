    "intro": "Hieracium aridum, commonly known as the desert hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, showing adaptations to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in a composite head, characteristic of the Asteraceae family. Its leaves are usually narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss through transpiration. Hieracium aridum is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and shrublands, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
