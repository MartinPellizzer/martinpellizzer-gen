    "intro": "Hypoestes clinopodia, commonly known as the \"Snowflake\" or \"Cape Myrtle,\" is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, compact foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly hairy texture. Hypoestes clinopodia is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils."
