    "intro": "Hydrocotyle uliginosa, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or grow submerged. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the summer months. It thrives in shallow, still waters and is often found in marshes, ponds, and along the edges of streams. Hydrocotyle uliginosa plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration."
