    "intro": "Hieracium glaucinum subsp. furcillatum, commonly known as the silver hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its silver-gray leaves and yellow flower heads, which consist of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring temperate climates. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental appearance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in natural habitats."
