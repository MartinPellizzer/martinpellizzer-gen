    "intro": "Hoya sigillatis subsp. sigillatis, commonly known as the \"Wax Plant\" or \"Porcelain Flower,\" is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are typically dark green with a glossy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are usually white or pale pink, often with a subtle fragrance. It is a popular houseplant due to its low maintenance and ability to thrive in indirect light. Hoya sigillatis subsp. sigillatis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and air-purifying qualities."
