    "intro": "Helleborine pallida, commonly known as the white helleborine, is a species of orchid native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb with a rhizomatous root system and produces showy, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, often unpleasant odor. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and rocky areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and arranged in a basal rosette, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. Helleborine pallida is known for its ability to thrive in low-light conditions and is often found in association with other woodland flora."
