    "intro": "Humboltia tribuloides, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring woody stems and thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Humboltia tribuloides is well-suited to drought conditions and plays a role in stabilizing desert soils."
