    "intro": "Haplopappus heterophyllus, commonly known as the desert sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its low, sprawling growth habit and gray-green foliage adapted to arid environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually alternate and linear, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Haplopappus heterophyllus is often found in sandy or gravelly soils, thriving in full sun and demonstrating drought tolerance."
