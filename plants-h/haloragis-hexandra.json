It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and sandy habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink or white. It is often found in dunes and along the edges of saltwater lakes. Its ability to thrive in saline environments makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
