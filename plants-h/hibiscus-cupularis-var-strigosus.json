    "intro": "Hibiscus cupularis var. strigosus, commonly known as the roughleaf hibiscus, is a perennial shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in summer. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, cup-shaped seed pods that split open to release seeds. Hibiscus cupularis var. strigosus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
