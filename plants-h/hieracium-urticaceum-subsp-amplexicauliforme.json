    "intro": "Hieracium urticaceum subsp. amplexicauliforme, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal leaves that often wrap around the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
