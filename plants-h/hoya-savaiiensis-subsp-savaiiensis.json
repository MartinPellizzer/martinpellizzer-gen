    "intro": "Hoya savaiiensis subsp. savaiiensis, commonly known as the Savaii hoya, is a species of flowering plant in the family Apocynaceae. It is native to the island of Savai'i in Samoa, where it grows as an epiphytic or lithophytic plant. The plant is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found on trees or rocky surfaces. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
