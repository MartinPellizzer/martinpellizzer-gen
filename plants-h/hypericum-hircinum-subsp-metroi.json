    "intro": "Hypericum hircinum subsp. metroi, commonly known as the Alpine St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer, which are followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and herbal traditions."
