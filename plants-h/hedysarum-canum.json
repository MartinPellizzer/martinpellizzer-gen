    "intro": "Hedysarum canum, commonly known as the white vetch, is a perennial leguminous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces slender, cylindrical pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Hedysarum canum plays a role in nitrogen fixation, making it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural settings."
