It is native to parts of Europe and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. It has hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The species is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a weed in some regions."
