It is characterized by its dense, golden-yellow inflorescences that resemble small cups, which are highly ornamental. The plant typically grows in coastal regions and is adapted to sandy, well-drained soils. It produces small, papery bracts that surround the tiny, tubular flowers, giving it a unique appearance. The species is often cultivated for its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in full sun."
