    "intro": "Hieracium picroides subsp. subintermixtum, commonly known as the hybrid meadowhawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to central and southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its composite flower heads, which consist of yellow disc florets surrounded by pale yellow to brownish ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lanceolate, rough to the touch, and often have a slightly hairy texture. This subspecies is noted for its variability in flower color and leaf morphology, which contributes to its classification as a hybrid form."
