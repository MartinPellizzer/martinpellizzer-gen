It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves and flowering stems that bear yellow disk flowers with surrounding ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions. Its subspecies name, *oppositum*, refers to the opposite arrangement of its leaves."
