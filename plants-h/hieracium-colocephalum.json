    "intro": "Hieracium colocephalum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium colocephalum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
