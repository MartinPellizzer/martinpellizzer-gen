    "intro": "Hakea amplexans, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, often prickly foliage and distinctive, urn-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are typically narrow and sometimes clasping, giving it a unique appearance. Hakea amplexans plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
