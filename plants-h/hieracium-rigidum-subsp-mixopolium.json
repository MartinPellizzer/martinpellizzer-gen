    "intro": "Hieracium rigidum subsp. mixopolium, commonly known as the rigid hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and yellowish to reddish flowering heads. The plant features basal and cauline leaves that are typically lanceolate or linear, with rough, hairy surfaces. Its flowers are borne in compact, discoid inflorescences, and the plant is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed sites. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, outcompeting native vegetation."
