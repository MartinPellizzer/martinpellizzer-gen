    "intro": "Hieracium bifidum subsp. maculosum, commonly known as the spotted hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant produces yellow flowers with a central disc surrounded by ray florets, and its leaves are typically hairy and lobed. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
