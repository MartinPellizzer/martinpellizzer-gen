    "intro": "Hemionitis hookeriana, commonly known as the Hooker's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Hemionitidaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a rosette. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Its reproductive structures, known as sori, are located on the underside of its fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
