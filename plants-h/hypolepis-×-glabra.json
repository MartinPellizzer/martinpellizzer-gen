    "intro": "Hypolepis \u00d7 glabra, commonly known as the smooth shield fern, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hypolepis scolopendria and Hypolepis zeylanica. It is characterized by its broad, smooth, and leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sori on the underside of its leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Hypolepis \u00d7 glabra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
