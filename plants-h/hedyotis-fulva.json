    "intro": "Hedyotis fulva, commonly known as the yellow dot moss or yellow-eyed grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream sides. The plant features small, bright yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are linear with a slightly hairy texture. Hedyotis fulva has a rhizomatous root system that helps it spread and establish in suitable habitats. It is often found in temperate regions and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in wetland ecosystems."
