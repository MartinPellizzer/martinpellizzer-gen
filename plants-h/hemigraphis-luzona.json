It features opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, arranged in clusters at the leaf axils. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in shaded environments. Hemigraphis luzona is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
