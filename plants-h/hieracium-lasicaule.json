It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It produces yellow flowers with a central disk, and its leaves are usually lance-shaped and hairy. Hieracium lasicaule is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
