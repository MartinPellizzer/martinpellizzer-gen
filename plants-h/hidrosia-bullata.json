    "intro": "Hidrosia bullata, commonly known as the sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is characterized by its waxy, fleshy leaves and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, making it well adapted to coastal environments. Its flowers are typically pollinated by hummingbirds and bees, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hidrosia bullata is often used in ornamental gardening due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
