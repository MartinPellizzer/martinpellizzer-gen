    "intro": "Hieracium illyricum subsp. coriifolium, commonly known as the Illyrian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, coriaceous leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite inflorescences, which are typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in some regions."
