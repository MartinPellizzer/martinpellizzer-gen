    "intro": "Hieracium confusum, commonly known as the confused hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the dandelion family (Compositae). It is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems, often found in disturbed soils and open habitats. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 centimeters and produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia but has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive. Due to its variability in appearance, it is often confused with other hawkweed species, hence its common name."
