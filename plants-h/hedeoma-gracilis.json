    "intro": "Hedeoma gracilis, commonly known as slender hedeoma, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbrella-like inflorescences, a typical feature of the carrot family. Hedeoma gracilis typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for pollinators."
