    "intro": "Haplopappus saxatilis, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a flowering plant native to arid and rocky regions of the western United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh environmental conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. The pale yellow flowers appear in the spring and are followed by small, papery bracts that persist into the autumn."
