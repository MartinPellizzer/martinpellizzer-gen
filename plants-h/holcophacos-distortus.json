    "intro": "Holcophacos distortus, commonly known as the distorted holcophacos, is a rare and lesser-known plant species belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its unique, irregularly shaped leaves and small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in the late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
