    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. anisobasis, commonly known as mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, rosette-like leaves and yellow flowers. The subspecies anisobasis is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and smaller, more compact growth form compared to other subspecies. It typically thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. The plant is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain environments."
