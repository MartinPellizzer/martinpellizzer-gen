It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often on slopes and cliffs, where it thrives in well-drained conditions. The plant features basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences. It is part of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
