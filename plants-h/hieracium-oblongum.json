    "intro": "Hieracium oblongum, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features dark green, broadly ovate leaves with a hairy texture and produces yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a weed in some regions."
