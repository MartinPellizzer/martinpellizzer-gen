    "intro": "Humata microsora, commonly known as the dwarf humata, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Acanthaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and delicate, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems. Humata microsora thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable candidate for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
