    "intro": "Heteropogon fertilis, commonly known as the fertile hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often bear small, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in grasslands and along watercourses. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its common name. Heteropogon fertilis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticultural settings."
