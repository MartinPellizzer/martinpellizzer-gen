    "intro": "Heleophylax triquetrus, commonly known as the three-angled orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique triquetrous (three-angled) stems and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late spring. The plant prefers shaded, humid environments and is often found in montane forests. Its botanical significance lies in its specialized morphology and limited distribution. Due to habitat destruction, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
