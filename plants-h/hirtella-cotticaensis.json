    "intro": "Hirtella cotticaensis, commonly known as the Cotticaensian hirtella, is a species of flowering plant native to the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes well-known genera such as Eucalyptus and Syzygium. The plant is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, clustered in small inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to habitat loss, Hirtella cotticaensis is considered threatened and is a focus of conservation efforts in its native range."
