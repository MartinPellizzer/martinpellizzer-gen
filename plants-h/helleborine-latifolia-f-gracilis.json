    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia f. gracilis, commonly known as the slender broad-leaf helleborine, is a hybrid orchid species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and pale greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often considered a conservation concern."
