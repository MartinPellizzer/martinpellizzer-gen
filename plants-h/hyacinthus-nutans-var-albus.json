    "intro": "Hyacinthus nutans var. albus, commonly known as the white-flowered hyacinth, is a cultivar of the hyacinth plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces strap-like, grassy leaves and has a compact, bushy growth habit. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a cut flower. This variety is less common than the blue and purple-flowered forms but is prized for its elegant, pale blooms."
