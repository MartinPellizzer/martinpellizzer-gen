    "intro": "Hieracium jurassiciforme subsp. grandimontis, commonly known as the Jurassic Hill Hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its upright growth and basal rosette of leaves. It typically features yellow composite flowers arranged in a single, showy head, with ray florets that are often longer than the disk florets. The plant is native to alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. Its leaves are generally rough and covered in fine hairs, and the stems are often reddish or purple-hued. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing mountainous terrain and supporting pollinator populations."
