    "intro": "Hymenophyllum punctisorum, commonly known as the spotted hound's-tongue, is a small, epiphytic fern native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its spores are produced in tiny, clustered sporangia located on the undersides of the leaves. Hymenophyllum punctisorum is notable for its unique appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
