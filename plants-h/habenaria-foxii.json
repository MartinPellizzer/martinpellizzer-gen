    "intro": "Habenaria foxii, commonly known as the Fox's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, often on the forest floor or on tree trunks. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive lip that is often adorned with intricate patterns. Its root system is fibrous, allowing it to absorb nutrients from the surrounding soil efficiently. Habenaria foxii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
