    "intro": "Helleborine latifolia subsp. varians, commonly known as the broad-leaf helleborine, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves and produces showy, greenish-yellow flowers with a distinctive, intricate structure. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, this species thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant's rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine, though it is toxic and should not be ingested. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both horticultural and ecological study."
