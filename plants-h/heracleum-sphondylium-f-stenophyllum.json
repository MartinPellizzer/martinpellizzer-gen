    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves compared to the typical form, which helps distinguish it from other members of the Apiaceae family. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like inflorescences, typical of the carrot family. It thrives in moist, disturbed habitats such as meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves and stems are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
