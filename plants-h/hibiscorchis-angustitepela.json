    "intro": "Hibiscorchis angustitepela, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hibiscorchis, is a rare and unique orchid species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink or white. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by specific insect species, contributing to its ecological niche. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
