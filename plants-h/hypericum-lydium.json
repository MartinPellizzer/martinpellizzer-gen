    "intro": "Hypericum lydium, commonly known as the Lydian St. John's Wort, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically arranged in clusters along the stems. The plant has narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or dry landscapes. The species is notable for its historical use in traditional medicine, though its chemical composition remains less studied compared to other hypericum species."
