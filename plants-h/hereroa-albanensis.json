    "intro": "Hereroa albanensis, commonly known as the Albanian hereroa, is a unique flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Albania. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbel-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, showcasing its adaptation to harsh environments. Its leaves are finely divided and aromatic, while its small white or pale yellow flowers bloom in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Hereroa albanensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
