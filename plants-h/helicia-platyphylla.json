It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters. Helicia platyphylla is typically found in lowland tropical rainforests and is often a component of the understory vegetation. It has limited commercial use but is of interest in botanical studies due to its unique morphology and ecological role."
