    "intro": "Heliotropium galioides, commonly known as the marsh heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring slender, hairy stems and alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, violet or purple flowers arranged in clusters at the ends of its stems, which bloom from late spring to early fall. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils, making it a common sight in swampy areas. Heliotropium galioides is also known for its ability to tolerate periodic flooding, which contributes to its ecological significance in wetland ecosystems."
