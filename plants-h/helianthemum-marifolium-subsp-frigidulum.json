    "intro": "Helianthemum marifolium subsp. frigidulum, commonly known as the alpine sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features small, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid, high-altitude habitat. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers during the summer months, adding a splash of color to rocky and sandy soils. It is adapted to harsh environmental conditions, including strong winds and intense sunlight. This subspecies is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal in rocky gardens."
