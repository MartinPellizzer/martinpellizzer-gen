    "intro": "Hosackia guadalupensis, commonly known as the Guadalupe milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky habitats, such as limestone soils and open woodlands. The plant produces small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often clustered in racemes. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a deep taproot system that helps it survive in arid conditions. Hosackia guadalupensis is also valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and stabilizing soil in its native range."
