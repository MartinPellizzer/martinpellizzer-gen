    "intro": "Hybidium grandiflorum, commonly known as the large-flowered hybidium, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically displaying vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is known for its complex floral structure and specialized pollination mechanisms. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely cultivated outside its native range."
