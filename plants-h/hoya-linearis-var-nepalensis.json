    "intro": "Hoya linearis var. nepalensis, commonly known as the Nepal waxplant, is a flowering plant native to the Himalayan regions of Nepal and northern India. It is characterized by its long, linear leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom during the warmer months. It is a popular choice for indoor cultivation due to its air-purifying properties and low maintenance requirements. Hoya linearis var. nepalensis thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil, making it suitable for both novice and experienced gardeners."
