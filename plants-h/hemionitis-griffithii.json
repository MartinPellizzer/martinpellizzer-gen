    "intro": "Hemionitis griffithii, commonly known as the Indian water fern, is a small, aquatic fern native to parts of Asia. It thrives in wetland environments and is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant has a unique reproductive system, producing spores rather than seeds, which allows it to spread in moist habitats. Its rhizomes form a network that helps anchor it in water and absorb nutrients. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining water quality."
