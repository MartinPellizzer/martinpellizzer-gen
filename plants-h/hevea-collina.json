    "intro": "Hevea collina, commonly known as the Brazilian rubber tree, is a small evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green in color. The plant is known for its latex-producing properties, although it is less commercially significant than its relative, Hevea brasiliensis. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments and prefers well-drained soils. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with the plant relying on insect pollination for reproduction."
