    "intro": "Hipposeris acerifolia, commonly known as the mapleleaf tree, is a deciduous tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, spherical fruits that persist through winter. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age. Hipposeris acerifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its seasonal foliage changes."
