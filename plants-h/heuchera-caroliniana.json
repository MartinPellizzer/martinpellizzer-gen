It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped with a rich green to bronze coloration, often adorned with red or purple veins. The plant produces clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by seed capsules. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit contribute to its horticultural value."
