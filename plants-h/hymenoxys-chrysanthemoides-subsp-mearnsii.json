    "intro": "Hymenoxys chrysanthemoides subsp. mearnsii, commonly known as Mearns' hymenoxys, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are generally gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. It is often found in open woodlands and along rocky slopes, where it thrives in full sun."
