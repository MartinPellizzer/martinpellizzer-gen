    "intro": "Hymenophyllum aequabile, commonly known as the common filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is characterized by its delicate, translucent fronds that are often less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and creeping, and it typically grows on tree trunks or rocks in humid environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and are protected by a specialized covering called a hymenium. Hymenophyllum aequabile is well adapted to shaded, moist habitats and is often found in rainforests."
