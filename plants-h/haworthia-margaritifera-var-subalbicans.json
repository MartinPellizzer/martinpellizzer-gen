    "intro": "Haworthia margaritifera var. subalbicans, commonly known as the white-veined Haworthia, is a compact, low-growing succulent native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, triangular leaves that are typically green with white or pale markings. The leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. It produces small, star-shaped white or yellow flowers on slender stems during the warmer months. This variety is prized for its unique appearance and ease of care, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
