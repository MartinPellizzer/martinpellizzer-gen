    "intro": "Herniaria pearsonii, commonly known as the pearson's bladderwort, is a small flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compact, mat-forming growth habit and has tiny, clustered flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, bladder-like structures called pseudobulbs, which are used for storing water and nutrients. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal areas. Herniaria pearsonii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens."
