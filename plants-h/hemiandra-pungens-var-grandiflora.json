    "intro": "Hemiandra pungens var. grandiflora, commonly known as the large-flowered hemiandra, is a striking tropical plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a faint pink or red tint. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers are borne in clusters and bloom during the wet season, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its visual impact."
