    "intro": "Hesperastragalus elmeri, commonly known as Elmer's milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and pod-like fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to arid environments. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in the spring, and its roots have a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
