    "intro": "Heylandia leiocarpa, commonly known as the golden orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees and deriving moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a dense, waxy cuticle that helps retain moisture in its humid, shaded habitat. Heylandia leiocarpa is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in tropical gardens."
