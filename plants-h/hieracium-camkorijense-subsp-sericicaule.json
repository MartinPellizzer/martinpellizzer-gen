    "intro": "Hieracium camkorijense subsp. sericicaule, commonly known as the silky-hair hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves covered in fine, silky hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Its subspecific distinction is based on morphological differences, particularly in leaf and flower structure."
