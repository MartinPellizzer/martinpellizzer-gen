    "intro": "Hieracium eremnocephalum, commonly known as the mountain hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. Hieracium eremnocephalum is known for its ability to form dense colonies, which can sometimes become invasive in its native range."
