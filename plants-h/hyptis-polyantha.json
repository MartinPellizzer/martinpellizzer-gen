It belongs to the Lamiaceae family, which is characterized by square stems and aromatic leaves. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. Its small, tubular flowers are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hyptis polyantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
