    "intro": "Hieracium cymiflorum, commonly known as the clustered hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sunlight. Its leaves are basal, forming a rosette, and are usually covered in fine, white hairs. The showy yellow flowers bloom in late summer, contributing to the plant's role in pollinator support in its native ecosystems."
