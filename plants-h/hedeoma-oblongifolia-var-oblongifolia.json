It typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale blue to purple flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in arid environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
