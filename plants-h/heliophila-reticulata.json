    "intro": "Heliophila reticulata, commonly known as the net-veined heliophyte, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, delicate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive net-like venation pattern. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white to pale blue flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Heliophila reticulata thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in shallow water or along the edges of ponds and streams. It plays an important ecological role in supporting aquatic and semi-aquatic ecosystems."
