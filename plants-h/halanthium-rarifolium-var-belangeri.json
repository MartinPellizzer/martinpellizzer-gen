    "intro": "Halanthium rarifolium var. belangeri, commonly known as the Belanger's water clover, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its delicate, submerged leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, resembling the appearance of a clover. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and streams, where it anchors itself to the substrate with its rhizomes. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually submerged, contributing to its limited visibility. Due to its restricted habitat and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
