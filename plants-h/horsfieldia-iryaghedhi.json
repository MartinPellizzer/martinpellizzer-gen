    "intro": "Horsfieldia iryaghedhi, commonly known as the Bornean white orchid, is a tropical epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, branching stems and large, showy white flowers. The plant typically grows on trees, using them for support rather than deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are fragrant and bloom during the rainy season, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is often found in protected areas."
