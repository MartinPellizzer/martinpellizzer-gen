    "intro": "Hordeum vulgare var. interpallidum, commonly known as the intermediate barley, is a variant of barley characterized by its intermediate traits between two other varieties. It is a member of the grass family Poaceae and is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, with slender, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence is a spike, composed of spikelets that bear both lemma and palea structures. The seeds, or grains, are enclosed in these spikelets and are the primary product harvested for agricultural use."
