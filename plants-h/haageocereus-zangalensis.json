    "intro": "Haageocereus zangalensis, commonly known as the Zangalensis cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of southern Mexico. It is a columnar cactus characterized by its smooth, pale green stems and sparse, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically short-lived but attract pollinators such as bees and moths. It has adapted to thrive in hot, dry environments with minimal water requirements. Its structure and growth habits make it well-suited for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
