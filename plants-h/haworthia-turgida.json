    "intro": "Haworthia turgida, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, cylindrical leaves with white tubercles that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant produces clusters of small, white, star-shaped flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it ideal for arid environments. Haworthia turgida is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its compact size and attractive appearance."
