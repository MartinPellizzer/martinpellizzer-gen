    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. crepidifolium, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of broad, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowering stems bear clusters of small, yellowish-orange composite flowers, which are arranged in a typical daisy-like pattern. The subspecies is distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaf shape compared to other Hieracium species."
