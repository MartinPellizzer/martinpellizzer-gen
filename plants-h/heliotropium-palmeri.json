    "intro": "Heliotropium palmeri, commonly known as Palmer's heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a herbaceous annual with slender, branching stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to violet. The plant produces tiny, spherical fruits called utricles, which contain seeds dispersed by wind. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in sandy soils and along dry streambeds. Its growth habit and floral structure are typical of the heliotrope family, with adaptations for efficient water use and pollination."
