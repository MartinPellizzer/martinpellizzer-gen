    "intro": "Huperzia sagasteguiana, commonly known as the Sagastegui huperzia, is a species of moss-like plant belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its simple, branching structure and small, ovate leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of other plants without deriving nutrients from them. It is native to South America, particularly found in regions of Ecuador and Peru. Huperzia sagasteguiana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, moist conditions."
