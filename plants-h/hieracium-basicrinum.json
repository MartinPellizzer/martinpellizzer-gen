    "intro": "Hieracium basicrinum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its hairy, upright stems and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The leaves are lance-shaped and have a rough texture, contributing to its common name. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in open, sunny habitats."
