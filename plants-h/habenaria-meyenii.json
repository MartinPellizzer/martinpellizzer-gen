    "intro": "Habenaria meyenii, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear pale green or white flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the soil. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species in many regions."
