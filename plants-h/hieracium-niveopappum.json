    "intro": "Hieracium niveopappum, commonly known as the white pappus hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while the flowers are white or pale yellow. The plant produces a tufted, white pappus that aids in wind dispersal of its seeds."
