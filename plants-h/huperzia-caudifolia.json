    "intro": "Huperzia caudifolia, commonly known as the tail-leaf huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, elongated, and often branched fronds that resemble tails, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its sporangia are clustered in specialized structures called sori, which are usually located on the underside of the fronds. Huperzia caudifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
