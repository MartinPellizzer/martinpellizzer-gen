    "intro": "Hedera unifolia, commonly known as the single-leaf ivy, is a species of flowering plant in the family Araliaceae. It is a trailing or climbing evergreen vine characterized by its small, glossy, dark green leaves that are typically arrowhead-shaped. Native to the Mediterranean region, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found growing on walls, rocks, or trees. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by red berries, which are toxic to humans and animals. Hedera unifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to cover surfaces in gardens and landscapes."
