It features a basal rosette of lance-shaped, hairy leaves that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in cup-like clusters, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Huttum calyptratum is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats."
