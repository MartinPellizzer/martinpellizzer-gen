    "intro": "Hymenocallis americana f. dryanderi, commonly known as the Dryander's spider lily, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, white, spider-like flowers with a distinctive red or orange stripe along the inner petals. The plant features strap-like, grassy foliage and produces bulbous underground storage organs typical of the genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens.
