    "intro": "Hyparrhenia hirta var. villosa, commonly known as the hairy or woolly hyparrhenia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and savannas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used for erosion control and as a forage plant for livestock."
