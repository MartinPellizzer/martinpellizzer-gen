It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. It has small, linear leaves and produces numerous tiny florets arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
