    "intro": "Hydrangea bifida, commonly known as the cutleaf hydrangea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, showy inflorescences that can range in color from white to pink and blue, depending on soil pH. The plant features palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It thrives in partial shade and moist, well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for garden landscapes. Hydrangea bifida is also known for its ability to produce abundant fruit, which is edible but often considered ornamental rather than culinary."
