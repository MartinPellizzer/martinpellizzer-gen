It features dense, upright clumps of dark green, heart-shaped foliage that often has a reddish or bronze tinge. The plant produces small, showy flowers in clusters of red, pink, or white during the late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
