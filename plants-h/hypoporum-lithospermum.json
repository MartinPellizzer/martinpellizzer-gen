    "intro": "Hypoporum lithospermum, commonly known as rock pepper, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale blue to purple flowers, which are typically arranged in dense inflorescences. Its roots are rich in iridoid glycosides and have been used in traditional medicine for their potential anti-inflammatory properties. Hypoporum lithospermum thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
