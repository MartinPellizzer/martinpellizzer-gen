    "intro": "Hieracium umbrosum subsp. jaceoides, commonly known as the shadowy hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and meadows. It has a taproot system and can form dense colonies in suitable conditions. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and flowering pattern compared to other Hieracium species."
