It is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, yellowish-green composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically reaches a height of only a few centimeters, making it a subtle addition to meadows and grassy areas. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is often found in disturbed soils and thrives in moist, open habitats."
