It is characterized by its hairy, compact growth habit and small, yellowish to reddish flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine regions, thriving in rocky and well-drained soils. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is notable for its resilience to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas across Europe."
