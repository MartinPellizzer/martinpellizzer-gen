    "intro": "Heracleum sphondylium f. trisegmentatum, commonly known as the three-segmented cow parsnip, is a variant of the cow parsnip species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive three-segmented leaves and large, umbrella-shaped flower heads. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can reach heights of up to 2 meters. Its foliage is often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into oval, dry fruits. This form is notable for its morphological variation compared to the typical species."
