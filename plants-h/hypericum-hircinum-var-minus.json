    "intro": "Hypericum hircinum var. minus, commonly known as lesser St. John's wort, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has opposite, linear to oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and can be found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas. This variety is similar to the more common Hypericum hircinum but is distinguished by its smaller size and more compact growth habit."
