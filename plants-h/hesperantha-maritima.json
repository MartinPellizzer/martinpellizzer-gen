    "intro": "Hesperantha maritima, commonly known as the coastal hesperantha, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal areas, where it thrives in sandy or rocky soils. The plant produces striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is often found in coastal dunes or near the shoreline. Hesperantha maritima is well adapted to saline and windy environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
