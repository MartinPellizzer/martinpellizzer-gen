It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and yellow composite flowers, which are typical of the dandelion family. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and grassy areas. The plant produces achenes with pappi, which aid in wind dispersal of its seeds. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
