It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, daisy-like flowers. The plant typically grows in open grasslands and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Its flowers bloom in spring, producing a cluster of yellow disc florets surrounded by white to pale pink ray florets. Habenella densa is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive appearance and drought tolerance."
