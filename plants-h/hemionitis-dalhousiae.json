    "intro": "Hemionitis dalhousiae, commonly known as the Dalhousie's hemionitis, is a rare and delicate fern native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that give it a graceful appearance. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
