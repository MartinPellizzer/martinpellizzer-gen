    "intro": "Heynea trifoliolata, commonly known as the three-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, and are often hairy on the underside. The flowers are borne on peduncles and are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds."
