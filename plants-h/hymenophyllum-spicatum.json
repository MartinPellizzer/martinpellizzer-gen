    "intro": "Hymenophyllum spicatum, commonly known as the spiky shield fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to the wet tropical regions of Asia and Australia. It features delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a dense covering of tiny, scale-like structures called trichomes. The plant's rhizomes are often covered in a layer of moss-like tissue, which helps it retain moisture in its humid environment. It thrives in shaded, moist areas and is often found growing on tree trunks or rocks. Its unique appearance and specialized adaptations make it a distinctive member of the Hymenophyllaceae family."
