    "intro": "Hepatica angulosa, commonly known as the angular liverwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northeastern United States. It belongs to the family Pterobryaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, moss-like structures. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, and white, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are usually divided into three parts, giving it a liver-like appearance, which is reflected in its common name. Hepatica angulosa thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
