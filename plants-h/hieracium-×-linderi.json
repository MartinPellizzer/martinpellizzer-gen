    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 linderi, commonly known as the hybrid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Hieracium auripunctatum and Hieracium piloselloides, leading to a diverse range of morphological characteristics. The plant typically features bright yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, with slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is native to Europe and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth habits and floral morphology, making it an interesting subject for botanical study."
