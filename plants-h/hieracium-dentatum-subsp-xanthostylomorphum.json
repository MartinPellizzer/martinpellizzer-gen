    "intro": "Hieracium dentatum subsp. xanthostylomorphum, commonly known as the yellow-styled hairy hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and yellowish flower heads. The subspecies is distinguished by its yellow central disk in the flower head, which contrasts with the typical brown or reddish coloration of other Hieracium species. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant produces small, rayless flowers that are arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family."
