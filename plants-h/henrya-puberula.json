    "intro": "Henrya puberula, commonly known as the silver leaf henrya, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, silver-gray foliage with a soft, velvety texture due to its fine, pubescent hairs. The plant produces small, bell-shaped white flowers in early spring, adding a delicate floral display. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for alpine gardens."
