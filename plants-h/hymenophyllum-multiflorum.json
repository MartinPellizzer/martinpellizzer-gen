    "intro": "Hymenophyllum multiflorum, commonly known as the velvet fern, is a small, delicate fern native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its soft, moss-like fronds covered in fine, velvety hairs, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds and contain spores for propagation. Hymenophyllum multiflorum is valued for its ornamental appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
