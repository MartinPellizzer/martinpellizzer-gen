    "intro": "Hieracium repandulans, commonly known as the spreading hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are usually hairy and somewhat woody at the base. Hieracium repandulans is often considered a weed in agricultural areas due to its rapid growth and ability to spread aggressively."
