It features silver-gray, hairy leaves that are lance-shaped and often arranged oppositely on the stems. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple, arranged in dense, spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks. Its aromatic foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for wetland restoration and native gardens."
