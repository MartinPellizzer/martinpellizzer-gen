It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface, and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters. Its fruit is a three-lobed capsule that disperses seeds by wind. Hedyotis mutica is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
