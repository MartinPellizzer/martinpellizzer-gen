    "intro": "Haworthia venosa var. tessellata, commonly known as the Zebra Haworthia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compact rosette of fleshy, triangular leaves that are covered in white to grayish tubercles, giving it a distinctive zebra-like appearance. The leaves are typically a bluish-green color with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright, indirect light to maintain its vibrant appearance. This plant is relatively low-maintenance, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
