    "intro": "Helicia formosana f. subintegra, commonly known as the Formosan holly. It is a rare variant of the species native to Taiwan, characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and compact growth habit. The plant features elliptical leaves with a waxy texture and a deep green color, often with subtle variegation. It produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are attractive to birds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
