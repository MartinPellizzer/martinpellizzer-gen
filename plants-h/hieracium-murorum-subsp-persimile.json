    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. persimile, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with slender stems and a dense mat of foliage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found in meadows and along roadsides. Its subspecies status reflects slight morphological differences from the nominate form, particularly in leaf shape and flowering behavior."
