    "intro": "Hieracium adakense, commonly known as Adak hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to the Aleutian Islands and surrounding regions of the North Pacific. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in coastal and maritime environments, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. It is characterized by its small, dandelion-like composite flowers and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
