It features a rosette of heart-shaped, glossy, waxy leaves that are typically submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, which bloom in late summer. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it an effective aquatic plant for water gardeners and pond management."
