    "intro": "Helianthemum halimifolium var. crispatum, commonly known as the crinkled rock rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is characterized by its crinkled, wavy leaf margins, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
