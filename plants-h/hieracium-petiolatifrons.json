It is characterized by its rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces clusters of yellow flowers with ray florets. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant has a taproot system and is often found in disturbed soils. Its foliage is typically covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores."
