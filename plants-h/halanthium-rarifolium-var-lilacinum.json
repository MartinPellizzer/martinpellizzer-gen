    "intro": "Halanthium rarifolium var. lilacinum, commonly known as the lilac-flowered water starwort, is a rare aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems and small, delicate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces tiny, lilac-colored flowers that bloom in the summer months, adding a subtle aesthetic to its habitat. It thrives in still or slow-moving waters with moderate light exposure. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
