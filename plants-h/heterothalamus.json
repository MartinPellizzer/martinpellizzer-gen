    "intro": "Heterothalamus, commonly known as the \"false morel,\" is a type of fungus rather than a plant, so it does not have botanical aspects in the traditional sense. It belongs to the family Gyromitraceae and is characterized by its distinctive, irregular cap shape and spore-producing structure. The fungus contains toxic compounds, including gyromitrin, which can be harmful to humans and animals. It is typically found in forested areas, growing on decaying wood or soil. Despite its name, it is not related to true morels and is often confused with them due to similar appearance."
