    "intro": "Hieracium pseudobertramii, commonly known as the Pseudobertram's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of the western United States, particularly in California and Nevada. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
