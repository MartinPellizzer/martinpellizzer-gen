    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. oegocladomorphum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its prostrate growth habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. It typically thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions, impacting native vegetation."
