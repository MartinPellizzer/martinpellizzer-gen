    "intro": "Heptapleurum reinianum, commonly known as the African nettle, is a flowering plant native to tropical Africa. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters in height, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually hairy on the underside. The plant produces small greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, and its fruits are small, round berries that turn red when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The plant has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties, though it is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
