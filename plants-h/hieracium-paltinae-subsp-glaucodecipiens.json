    "intro": "Hieracium paltinae subsp. glaucodecipiens, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy, yellowish-green stems and basal rosettes of leaves. The flowers are typically yellow and form in clusters, often with a distinctive central disk. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This subspecies is notable for its glaucous (bluish-green) appearance, which helps it retain moisture in dry conditions."
