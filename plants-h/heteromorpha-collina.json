    "intro": "Heteromorpha collina, commonly known as the coastal sea holly, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and striking blue or purple flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong coastal winds. Its leaves are usually small, fleshy, and often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Heteromorpha collina is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is a symbol of coastal resilience."
