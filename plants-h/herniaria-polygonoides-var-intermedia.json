    "intro": "Herniaria polygonoides var. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate bladderwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant that thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is characterized by its small, fleshy, bladder-like structures called pseudobulbs, which are used for water storage. The plant produces tiny white or pale yellow flowers during the summer months, typically arranged in clusters at the base of the stems. Its leaves are linear and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in wet meadows and along the edges of ponds."
