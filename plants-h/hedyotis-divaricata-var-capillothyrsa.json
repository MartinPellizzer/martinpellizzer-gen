    "intro": "Hedyotis divaricata var. capillothyrsa, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed garden spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family, characterized by its small, opposite leaves and clusters of white or yellow flowers. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, often found in moist, shaded environments. Its stems are covered in fine, hairy pubescence, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Hedyotis. The flowers are followed by small, three-lobed capsules that contain numerous tiny seeds."
