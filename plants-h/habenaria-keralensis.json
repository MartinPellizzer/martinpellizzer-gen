    "intro": "Habenaria keralensis, commonly known as the Keralan orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces delicate, greenish-yellow flowers with three petals and a spurred lip, typical of many orchid species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
