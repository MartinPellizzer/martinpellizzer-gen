    "intro": "Hypericum dubium var. perforatum, commonly known as the common St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its yellow flowers, which bloom in late summer, and its opposite, elliptical leaves that are often dotted with small glands. The plant contains bioactive compounds such as hypericin and hyperforin, which have been studied for their potential antidepressant properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its medicinal uses have made it a subject of both traditional and modern herbal practices."
