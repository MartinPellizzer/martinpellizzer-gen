    "intro": "Hieracium assimile, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers and is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a fuzzy texture, while its stems are hairy and somewhat branched. Hieracium assimile is an invasive species in some regions, outcompeting native vegetation due to its rapid growth and prolific seed production."
