    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracium caesium subsp. plumbeum, commonly known as the blue hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. The plant features basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the upper leaves are narrower and more upright. Its flowers are yellow, with a distinctive central disc surrounded by ray florets, and it blooms from late spring to early autumn. The subspecies plumbeum is distinguished by its bluish-green foliage, which gives it its common name."
