It typically features prostrate or ascending stems that are often hairy, with small, opposite, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers, which are followed by small, round, red berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland or rocky areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a common species in horticultural and ecological studies."
