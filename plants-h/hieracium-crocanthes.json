It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers are arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with ray florets that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hieracium crocanthes is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and adaptability."
