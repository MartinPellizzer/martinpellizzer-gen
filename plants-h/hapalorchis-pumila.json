    "intro": "Hapalorchis pumila, commonly known as the small liverwort, is a non-vascular plant belonging to the family Pottiaceae. It is a cryptogamic plant that thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found on rocks or soil surfaces. The plant has a thalloid structure, consisting of a flattened, leaf-like body that is usually green or reddish in color. It lacks true roots, stems, and leaves, and instead absorbs water and nutrients through its entire surface. Hapalorchis pumila plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small invertebrates."
