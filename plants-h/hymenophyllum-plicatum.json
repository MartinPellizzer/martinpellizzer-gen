    "intro": "Hymenophyllum plicatum, commonly known as the pleated hymenophyllum, is a species of moss belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that are often pleated or folded, giving it a unique appearance. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. Its small, spore-producing structures, called sporangia, are clustered in dense, cup-like formations called soruses. Hymenophyllum plicatum plays a role in maintaining soil moisture and providing habitat for microorganisms in its native ecosystems."
