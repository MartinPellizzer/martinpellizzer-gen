    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. denticulosum, commonly known as the denticulate hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in a single head. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in meadows and grassy areas. It has small, glandular hairs on its leaves and stems, which give it a distinctive appearance. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
