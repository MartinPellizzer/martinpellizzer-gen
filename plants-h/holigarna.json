    "intro": "Holigarna, commonly known as the \"ghost orchid,\" is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers and its unique ability to grow on tree branches without soil. The plant has no leaves, relying entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the canopy of longleaf pine forests. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, the holigarna is considered a conservation concern."
