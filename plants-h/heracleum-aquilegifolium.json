    "intro": "Heracleum aquilegifolium, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a tall biennial plant native to North America. It features large, umbrella-shaped compound leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, somewhat toxic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a compound umbel, typical of the Apiaceae family. Its roots are thick and fleshy, and the plant is often found in moist meadows and along streambanks. It is important to note that all parts of the plant can cause skin irritation upon contact."
