    "intro": "Horsfieldia ralunensis, commonly known as the Ralun orchid, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its epiphytic growth habit, often found growing on tree trunks or branches in humid forest environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. Its botanical features include strap-shaped leaves and a complex root system adapted for nutrient absorption from its host. Horsfieldia ralunensis is valued both for its ornamental appeal and its ecological role in tropical ecosystems."
