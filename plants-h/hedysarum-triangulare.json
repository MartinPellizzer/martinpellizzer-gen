    "intro": "Hedysarum triangulare, commonly known as the three-angled vetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are three-lobed and arranged in a triangular shape, giving the plant its scientific name. The plant produces small, yellowish to reddish flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by narrow, bean-like pods. Hedysarum triangulare is often found in rocky or gravelly soils and is adapted to dry, temperate climates. It plays a role in soil stabilization and is sometimes cultivated for forage or ornamental purposes."
