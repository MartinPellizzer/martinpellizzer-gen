    "intro": "Helianthemum milleri var. eriocaulon, commonly known as the woolly rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its succulent leaves are adapted to store water, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for rocky or well-drained soils. The variety eriocaulon is distinguished by its particularly dense and soft hair covering the stems and leaves."
