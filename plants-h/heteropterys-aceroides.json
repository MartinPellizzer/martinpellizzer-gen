    "intro": "Heteropterys aceroides, commonly known as the maple-leaved hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 6 meters tall, featuring broad, palmately lobed leaves that resemble those of maple trees. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of red, yellow, and orange, which bloom during the warmer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, hairy seeds. Heteropterys aceroides is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates."
