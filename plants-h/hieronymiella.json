    "intro": "Hieronymiella, commonly known as the false hellebore, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It consists of a single species, Hieronymiella thunbergii, which is native to eastern Asia, particularly Japan. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves and a tall, slender flowering stem that produces small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas. The genus is named in honor of the botanist Hieronymus Bock, reflecting its historical significance in botanical studies."
