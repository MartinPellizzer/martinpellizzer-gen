    "intro": "Haplostichanthus fruticosus, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a mat-forming growth habit with prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a slightly hairy texture. Haplostichanthus fruticosus is often found in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions."
