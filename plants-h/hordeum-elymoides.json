    "intro": "Hordeum elymoides, commonly known as alkali grass, is a species of grass native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of wax. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny grains, which are adapted for wind dispersal. Hordeum elymoides is highly drought-tolerant and thrives in saline or alkaline soils, making it an important component of desert ecosystems. Its hardy nature allows it to persist in harsh environments where few other plants can survive."
