    "intro": "Hieracium praevittatiflorum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and ragworts, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its yellow flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, and it produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind. Hieracium praevittatiflorum is often found in temperate regions and can sometimes become invasive in non-native habitats."
