    "intro": "Hedysarum moniliferum, commonly known as the bead lupin, is a perennial legume native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces long, cylindrical pods that contain numerous small, bead-like seeds, giving it its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Hedysarum moniliferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it beneficial for ecological restoration projects."
