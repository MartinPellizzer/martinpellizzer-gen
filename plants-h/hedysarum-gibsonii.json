    "intro": "Hedysarum gibsonii, commonly known as Gibson's vetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, pea-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in rocky and arid environments. Hedysarum gibsonii is often found in alpine meadows and is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions."
