    "intro": "Harina, commonly known as cornmeal, is a fine powder made from ground corn, typically maize (Zea mays). It is a staple ingredient in many cuisines, particularly in Latin American and African cooking. Botanically, it originates from the kernels of the maize plant, which is a member of the grass family, Poaceae. The process of grinding the dried kernels into a powder alters its texture and nutritional profile. Harina is rich in carbohydrates and provides essential nutrients like fiber and B vitamins."
