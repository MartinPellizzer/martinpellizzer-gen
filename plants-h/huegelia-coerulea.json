It features striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. The plant typically grows to a height of 30 to 60 centimeters, with lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Its flowers are tubular in shape, with five lobes, and are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens and alpine settings."
