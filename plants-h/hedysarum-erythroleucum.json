    "intro": "Hedysarum erythroleucum, commonly known as the red-and-white peavine, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, pea-like flowers that are typically pink or red with white markings, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its pods are elongated and contain several small, kidney-shaped seeds. Hedysarum erythroleucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it useful in ecological restoration projects."
