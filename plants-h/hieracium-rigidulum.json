    "intro": "Hieracium rigidulum, commonly known as rigid hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are rough and hairy, and the flowers are yellow with a distinctive central disc. It is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
