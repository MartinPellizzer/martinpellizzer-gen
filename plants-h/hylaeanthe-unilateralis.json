    "intro": "Hylaeanthe unilateralis, commonly known as the single-sided hylaeanthe, is a rare and enigmatic flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its unique bilateral symmetry, with one side of the plant exhibiting distinct floral structures compared to the other. The plant's leaves are typically elongated and lance-shaped, with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from pale yellow to deep orange. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Hylaeanthe unilateralis is considered a species of conservation concern."
