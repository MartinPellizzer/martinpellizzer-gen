    "intro": "Hieracium seguierianum, commonly known as the Seguier's hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant is perennial and can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it somewhat invasive in certain regions. Its botanical structure and growth habits make it a notable species in ecological studies and botanical gardens."
