    "intro": "Hagenia anthelmintica, commonly known as the red hagenia, is a flowering shrub native to the highlands of Ethiopia and parts of Kenya. It is characterized by its distinctive red, papery bracts that surround its small, yellow flowers. The plant produces woody pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Hagenia anthelmintica is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in areas with high altitudes. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment and has traditional medicinal uses."
