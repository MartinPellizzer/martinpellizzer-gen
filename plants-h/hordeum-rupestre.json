It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing\u9896\u679c (glumes) that enclose the seeds. Hordeum rupestre is adapted to survive in harsh environments with low soil fertility and limited water availability. It plays a role in stabilizing soils and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
