These plants are native to Australia and are characterized by their showy, dandelion-like flowers that range in color from yellow to red. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Helipterum species often grow in sandy or rocky soils and are adapted to arid environments. They are popular in horticulture for their ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal regions."
