    "intro": "Hypericum mutilum subsp. boreale, commonly known as the northern St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically grows in open, rocky, or sandy habitats and is adapted to harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, and its leaves are usually narrow and densely packed. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and the presence of glandular dots on its stems and leaves. This subspecies is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in extreme environments."
