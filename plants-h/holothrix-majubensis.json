    "intro": "Holothrix majubensis, commonly known as the Natal grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Holothrix majubensis is adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in grassland and savanna habitats."
