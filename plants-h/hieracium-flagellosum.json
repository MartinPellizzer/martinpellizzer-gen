    "intro": "Hieracium flagellosum, commonly known as the devil's darning needle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its spiky, bristly appearance, with dark green, lance-shaped leaves and yellow-orange flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. The plant is known for its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly, making it a common weed in many regions. Its common name reflects its sharp, needle-like foliage, which can be quite prickly to the touch."
