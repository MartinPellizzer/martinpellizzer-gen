    "intro": "Hieracium scorzonerifolium subsp. triglaviense, commonly known as the Triglavian hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It features a rosette of basal leaves that are broadly ovate to elliptic in shape, with hairy surfaces and serrated edges. The plant produces yellow flowers in early summer, arranged in a single terminal capitulum. It thrives in rocky and calcareous soils, often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
