    "intro": "Hedera helix var. azorica, commonly known as the Azores ivy, is a variant of the common ivy that originates from the Azores islands. It is a climbing evergreen vine characterized by its dark green, lobed leaves that are often slightly hairy on the underside. This plant thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Its adaptability makes it a popular choice for vertical gardening and as a ground cover. The Azores ivy is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to climb walls or trellises."
