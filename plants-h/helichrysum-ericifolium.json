    "intro": "Helichrysum ericifolium, commonly known as the woolly sunflower, is a small evergreen shrub native to the western regions of North America. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, adding a bright touch to its foliage. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
