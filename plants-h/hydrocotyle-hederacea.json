    "intro": "Hydrocotyle hederacea, commonly known as marsh mallow or water pepper, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features a creeping rhizome system that allows it to spread across moist soil surfaces. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Small, white flowers with five petals appear in clusters during the summer months. It is adapted to waterlogged conditions and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils."
