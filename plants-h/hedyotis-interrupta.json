    "intro": "Hedyotis interrupta, commonly known as the interrupted mistletoe, is a small evergreen shrub native to southeastern Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and understoreys. The plant features opposite, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, often with a slight waxy coating. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round berries that are edible for some bird species. Hedyotis interrupta plays a role in providing habitat and food for native wildlife in its ecosystem."
