    "intro": "Hymenophyllum henkelii, commonly known as the silver fern, is a small, delicate fern belonging to the family Hymenophyllaceae. It is characterized by its finely divided, silvery-green fronds that are covered in a dense layer of trichomes, giving it a distinctive appearance. This species thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in tropical and subtropical regions. The fronds are usually less than 10 centimeters in length and have a leathery texture. Hymenophyllum henkelii is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in the right conditions."
