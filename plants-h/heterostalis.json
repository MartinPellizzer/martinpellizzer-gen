    "intro": "Heterostalis, commonly known as the false indigo, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its compound leaves and showy, pea-like flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant is native to various regions in the Americas and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Heterostalis species are known for their nitrogen-fixing ability, which benefits the surrounding soil. The seeds are enclosed in pods and are dispersed by wind or animals, contributing to the plant's ecological role."
