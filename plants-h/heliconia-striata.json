It belongs to the ginger family (Zingiberaceae) and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers inside the bracts, which are often mistaken for petals. Heliconia striata thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rainforests. Its striking appearance makes it a popular ornamental plant in gardens and greenhouses."
