    "intro": "Hieracium chloreilema, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a rough texture, and its flowers are typically yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
