    "intro": "Hexalectris spicata, commonly known as the pink spiky beardtongue, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils in open woodlands and mountainous areas. The plant produces tall, sparsely branched stems that bear clusters of pink to purple flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its unique floral structure, with long, spiky sepals and tubular petals, is adapted for pollination by long-tongued bees. Hexalectris spicata is also known for its ability to thrive in harsh, arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
