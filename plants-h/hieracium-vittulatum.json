    "intro": "Hieracium vittulatum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its yellow flowers bloom from June to August, and it produces seeds in small, fluffy structures that aid in wind dispersal. Hieracium vittulatum is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize new areas."
