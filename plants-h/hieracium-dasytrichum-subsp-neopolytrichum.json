    "intro": "Hieracium dasytrichum subsp. neopolytrichum, commonly known as the rough hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and serrated leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and waste areas, and can form dense colonies. Its leaves are rough to the touch, with a hairy surface, and it produces yellow flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. This subspecies is often found in moist, calcareous environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
