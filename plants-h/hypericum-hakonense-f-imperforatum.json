    "intro": "Hypericum hakonense f. imperforatum, commonly known as the golden-stemmed St. John's wort, is a compact shrub native to the Nordic regions. It features narrow, dark green leaves with a slight pubescence and produces clusters of bright yellow flowers in late summer. The flowers have five petals and are surrounded by four sepals, typical of the Hypericaceae family. This variety is distinguished by its imperforate (solid) leaflets, which set it apart from other forms of Hypericum hakonense. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a suitable plant for rock gardens and alpine settings."
