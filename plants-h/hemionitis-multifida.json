    "intro": "Hemionitis multifida, commonly known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small, evergreen fern that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are divided into narrow, toothed segments. The plant typically grows in rocky crevices or on tree trunks, forming dense mats that help retain moisture. Its rhizomes are wiry and often form a network that anchors it to its substrate. Hemionitis multifida is a hardy species that is often found in alpine and subalpine regions across the Northern Hemisphere."
