    "intro": "Humularia elisabethvilleana, commonly known as the Elizabethville flameflower, is a rare and striking plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central Africa. It is characterized by its vibrant orange-red tubular flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant has heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are dark green and often covered in a waxy coating. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with adventitious roots, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
