    "intro": "Hieracium juranum subsp. decrescentifolium, commonly known as the Jura hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and open woodland areas, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lanceolate and hairy, with a central stem that bears yellow flower heads composed of small disk flowers. Its leaves are often decurrent, meaning they gradually narrow and extend down the stem, giving it a distinctive appearance. It is part of the Asteraceae family, known for its composite flower heads and wind-pollinated flowers."
