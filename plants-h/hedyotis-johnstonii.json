    "intro": "Hedyotis johnstonii, commonly known as Johnston's spurge, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, opposite leaves and yellow flowers. The plant typically thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest floors or along stream banks. Its small, fleshy stems and leaves are adapted to retain water, and it produces tiny, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds through wind. Hedyotis johnstonii is an important component of New Zealand's native flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
