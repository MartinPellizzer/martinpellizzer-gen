    "intro": "Haloragodendron lucasii, commonly known as Lucas's willow-herb, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Haloragaceae and is characterized by its slender, herbaceous stems and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands and along stream margins, preferring moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its leaves are alternate and often have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Haloragodendron lucasii plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for native invertebrates."
