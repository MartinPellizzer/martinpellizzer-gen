    "intro": "Helichrysum stenocephalum, commonly known as the narrow-headed everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and produces small, bright yellow to orange flowers that are often retained on the plant even after blooming, giving it a long-lasting appearance. The plant has hairy leaves and stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Helichrysum stenocephalum is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
