    "intro": "Hieracium holopleurum subsp. holopleuroides, commonly known as the broad-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters. The plant features basal rosettes of broadly ovate to lanceolate leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. Its flowers are yellow, arranged in a single head, and are surrounded by a series of bracts. The subspecies is characterized by its broader leaves and more robust growth compared to other hawkweed species."
