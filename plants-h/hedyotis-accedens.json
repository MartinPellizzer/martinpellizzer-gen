    "intro": "Hedyotis accedens, commonly known as the small flame vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Pacific Islands. It is a trailing or climbing herb that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and shrublands. The plant produces small, bright yellow or orange flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often hairy. Hedyotis accedens is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. It is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits, though scientific validation of these uses is limited."
