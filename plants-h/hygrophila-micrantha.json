    "intro": "Hygrophila micrantha, commonly known as the small-flowered water plant, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, opposite leaves that are elliptical in shape. Its flowers are tiny, clustered in spikes, and usually have four petals, blooming in shades of white or pale yellow. Hygrophila micrantha plays a role in water purification and provides habitat for aquatic organisms."
