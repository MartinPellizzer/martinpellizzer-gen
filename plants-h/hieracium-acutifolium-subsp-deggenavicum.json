It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in certain regions of Europe."
