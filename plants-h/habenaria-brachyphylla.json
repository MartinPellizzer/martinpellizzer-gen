    "intro": "Habenaria brachyphylla, commonly known as the short-stemmed sword orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant features slender, upright stems with a few leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered at the top. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient uptake. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
