    "intro": "Heliconia darienensis, commonly known as the Darien heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful inflorescences that resemble a crown of flowers. The plant has broad, waxy leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. Its flowers are primarily pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure. Heliconia darienensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and greenhouses."
