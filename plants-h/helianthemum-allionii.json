    "intro": "Helianthemum allionii, commonly known as the allion's rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features dense clusters of small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, fleshy leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hairs. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited to Mediterranean climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes."
