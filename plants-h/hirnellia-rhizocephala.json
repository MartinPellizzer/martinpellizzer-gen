    "intro": "Hirnellia rhizocephala, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant white flowers and its ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant is valued for its hard, durable wood, which is used in traditional craftsmanship and furniture making. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in sandy or loamy soils. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
