It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, brightly colored bracts that resemble flowers. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers inside the bracts, which are often mistaken for the actual flowers. Its leaves are broad, sword-shaped, and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. The Rodriguez heliconia is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes."
