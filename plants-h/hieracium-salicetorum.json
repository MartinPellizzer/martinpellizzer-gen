It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring moist to moderately dry conditions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a hairy texture, while its flowers are yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster. Hieracium salicetorum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a common but sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
