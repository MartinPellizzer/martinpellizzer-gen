It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along forest edges, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer.
