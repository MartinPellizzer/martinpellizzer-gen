    "intro": "Hippocrepis atlantica, commonly known as the Atlantic rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant native to the rocky coastal areas of the Iberian Peninsula. It is a perennial herb with a compact, low-growing habit, adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, helping to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
