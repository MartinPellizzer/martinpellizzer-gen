    "intro": "Hymenocyclus croceus, commonly known as the golden star cactus, is a species of cactus native to the dry forests of central Mexico. It is characterized by its cylindrical, ribbed stems that are typically green with a yellowish or golden hue. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. It has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions and requires well-draining soil. Hymenocyclus croceus is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique appearance and low maintenance requirements."
