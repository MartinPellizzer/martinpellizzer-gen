    "intro": "Hemionitis venusta, commonly known as the golden star moss, is a rare and delicate liverwort native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its intricate, star-shaped thallus that is covered in tiny, bright yellow to golden-green gametophores. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in rocky crevices or on tree trunks. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest in botanical studies. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Hemionitis venusta is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
