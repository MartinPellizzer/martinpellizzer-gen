    "intro": "Hedaroma tulipiferum, commonly known as the tulip tree, is a deciduous tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, resembling tulips, hence its common name. The tree has opposite, simple, ovate leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. It produces long, pendulous clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by winged seeds. The bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and the tree is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
