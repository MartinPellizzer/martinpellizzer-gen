It typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and tundra, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. The plant features basal rosettes of pale green, lanceolate leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowers are arranged in a single, terminal head, with both ray and disc florets contributing to its showy appearance. The species is characterized by its slender stem and is often found in association with other alpine and arctic flora."
