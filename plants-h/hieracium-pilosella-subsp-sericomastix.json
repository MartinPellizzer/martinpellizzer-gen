    "intro": "Hieracium pilosella subsp. sericomastix, commonly known as the silky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its soft, silky hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It typically grows in moist, grassy areas and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant is considered invasive in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to form dense mats."
