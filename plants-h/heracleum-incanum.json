    "intro": "Heracleum incanum, commonly known as the woolly cowparsley, is a biennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, gray-green stems and large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters, typical of the carrot family (Apiaceae). It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its toxic sap, it is considered a weed in agricultural areas."
