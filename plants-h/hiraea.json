    "intro": "Hiraea, commonly known as the \"twinleaf\" or \"false hellebore,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often heart-shaped or ovate. The flowers are small and clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically greenish or reddish in color. Hiraea species are typically found in temperate regions and are often adapted to moist, shaded environments. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their toxicity requires caution."
