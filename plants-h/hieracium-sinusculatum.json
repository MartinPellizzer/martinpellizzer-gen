    "intro": "Hieracium sinusculatum, commonly known as the lesser spearthistle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and wastelands, and it can reach heights of up to 60 centimeters. Its leaves are often spiny and have a rough texture, while the flowers are yellow and bloom in late summer. It is considered a minor weed but plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
