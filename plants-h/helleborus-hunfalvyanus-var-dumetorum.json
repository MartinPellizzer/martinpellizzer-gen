    "intro": "Helleborus hunfalvyanus var. dumetorum, commonly known as the Hungarian hellebore, is a perennial plant native to the Carpathian region. It features dark green, leathery leaves with a waxy texture and produces striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple. The plant is known for its slow growth and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in late winter or early spring, making it one of the earliest blooming hellebores. The plant contains toxic compounds, so it should be handled with care."
