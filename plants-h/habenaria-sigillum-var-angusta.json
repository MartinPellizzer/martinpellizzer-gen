    "intro": "Habenaria sigillum var. angusta, commonly known as the narrow-lobed marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in wet, shaded habitats such as marshes and swamps. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, and it relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake. The varietal name 'angusta' refers to its narrower leaf blades compared to the typical form of Habenaria sigillum."
