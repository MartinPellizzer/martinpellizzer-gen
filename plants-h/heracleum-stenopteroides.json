    "intro": "Heracleum stenopteroides, commonly known as giant hogweed, is a large herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a tall, hollow stem covered in purple spots and white, veiny leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in height. The plant produces large, umbrella-shaped clusters of small white flowers, which are followed by green, spiny fruits. It is known for its toxic sap, which can cause severe skin irritation and photodermatitis when exposed to sunlight. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
