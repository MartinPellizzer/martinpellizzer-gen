It is a climbing cactus with spiny stems and produces large, fragrant flowers that open at night. The plant is characterized by its pale yellow to white flowers, which have a pleasant scent to attract nocturnal pollinators. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique blooming habit and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in warm climates."
