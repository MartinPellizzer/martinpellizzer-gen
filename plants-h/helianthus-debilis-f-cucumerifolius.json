    "intro": "Helianthus debilis f. cucumerifolius, commonly known as the cucumberleaf sunflower, is a compact, herbaceous perennial native to the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves with a distinctive waxy coating, giving them a cucumber-like texture, hence its common name. The plant produces yellow daisy-like flowers with a prominent central disk, blooming from summer to fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its low maintenance and ability to attract pollinators make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
