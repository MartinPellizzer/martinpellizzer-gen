    "intro": "Hieracium leucopsaroides, commonly known as the white-haired hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of stiff, hairy leaves and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in grassy areas and disturbed soils. The plant's hairy foliage and showy inflorescence make it distinctive within the genus Hieracium. It is often considered a weed but can be found in various habitats across its native range."
