It belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae, and is characterized by its silver-gray foliage due to dense pubescence. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple, arranged in dense clusters. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry to semi-arid habitats.
