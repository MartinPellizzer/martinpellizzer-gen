    "intro": "Hieracium praetextum, commonly known as the purple hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant features dark green, hairy leaves and produces showy, purple to pink flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found in meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its aggressive growth, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
