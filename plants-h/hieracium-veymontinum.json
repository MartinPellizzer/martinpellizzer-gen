    "intro": "Hieracium veymontinum, commonly known as the Veymontin hawkweed, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is a perennial herb characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow composite flowers. Native to Europe, it thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has finely divided leaves and produces small, wind-pollinated flowers that attract various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
