    "intro": "Hylocereus bronxensis, commonly known as the Bronx night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and its ability to produce large, fragrant flowers at night. The plant is a member of the Cactaceae family and is adapted to arid environments with minimal water requirements. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and bloom only during the night, attracting nocturnal pollinators like bats and moths. Due to its unique blooming pattern and striking appearance, it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes."
