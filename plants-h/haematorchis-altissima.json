    "intro": "Haematorchis altissima, commonly known as the red-tongue orchid, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, colorful flowers that often display a mix of red, orange, and yellow hues. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in humid, shaded environments. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain, which is typical for many orchid species. The flowers bloom in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
