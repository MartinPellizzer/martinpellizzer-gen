    "intro": "Hedyotis schlechtendahliana var. nitens, commonly known as the shining dotweed, is a perennial herb native to tropical regions of South America. It features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are opposite, ovate to lanceolate, and have a glossy surface that reflects light, giving the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
