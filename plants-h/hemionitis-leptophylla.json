    "intro": "Hemionitis leptophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hemionite, is a rare and specialized fern native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to extreme environmental conditions. The plant has small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hair, which helps reduce water loss. Its reproductive structures are unique, with sporangia clustered in sori on the underside of the leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
