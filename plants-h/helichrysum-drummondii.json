    "intro": "Helichrysum drummondii, commonly known as the golden everlasting, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its dense, yellowish-orange inflorescences that resemble small daisies. The plant is perennial and thrives in well-drained, sandy soils, often found in open grasslands and rocky areas. Its small, papery bracts give it a long-lasting appearance, making it popular in dried floral arrangements. Helichrysum drummondii is also valued for its medicinal properties, traditionally used in herbal remedies."
