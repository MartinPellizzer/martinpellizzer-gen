    "intro": "Helianthemum variabile var. cinereum, commonly known as the silver saxifrage, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, rounded leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-gray coating, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, adding a vibrant touch to its compact form. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its drought tolerance and ability to thrive in poor soils."
