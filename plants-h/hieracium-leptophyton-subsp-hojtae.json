    "intro": "Hieracium leptophyton subsp. hojtae, commonly known as the Hojta's hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and is typically found in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant produces small, yellowish to brownish composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are usually narrow and covered with fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique adaptations to high-altitude habitats."
