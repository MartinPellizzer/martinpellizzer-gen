    "intro": "Hierapicra, commonly known as the poison ivy vine, is a climbing plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its opposite, simple, and usually elliptic or ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in catkins, and its fruits are three-winged capsules containing seeds. Hierapicra contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can cause severe skin irritation in humans. It is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
