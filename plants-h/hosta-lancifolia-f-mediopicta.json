    "intro": "Hosta lancifolia f. mediopicta, commonly known as the broad-leaf hosta with a medium variegation. This cultivar is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that display a striking combination of green and white variegation. The foliage tends to be more substantial and broader than typical hosta leaves, giving it a unique, bold appearance. It thrives in partial to full shade, making it an excellent choice for woodland gardens. The plant is relatively low maintenance, requiring well-drained soil and consistent moisture for optimal growth."
