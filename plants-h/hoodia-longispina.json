It belongs to the Asclepiadaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems and small, yellowish flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, storing water in its thick leaves and stems. It produces small, spiny fruits that contain seeds, which are dispersed by animals. Hoodia longispina is often found in rocky soils and is relatively rare in the wild."
