    "intro": "Hippocrepis toletana, commonly known as the Toleto rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spurred flowers that are typically violet or purple in color. The plant thrives in rocky and sunny habitats, often found in limestone areas. It has narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
