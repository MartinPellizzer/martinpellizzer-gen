    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum var. hepaticum, commonly known as the liverworts, is a type of non-vascular plant that belongs to the family Hepaticaceae. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. The plant has a simple structure with a thallus, which is a leaf-like body that lacks true roots, stems, and leaves. It reproduces through spores rather than seeds, and its growth is often slow and dependent on humid conditions. This variety is characterized by its small, lobed leaves and is often found in association with other mosses and lichens."
