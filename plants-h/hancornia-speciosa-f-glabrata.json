It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange flowers surrounded by bright red bracts. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes, and its stems are often covered in a thick, waxy cuticle. It thrives in warm, humid environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its vibrant floral display. The f. glabrata form is distinguished by its smoother, less hairy leaves compared to the typical form."
