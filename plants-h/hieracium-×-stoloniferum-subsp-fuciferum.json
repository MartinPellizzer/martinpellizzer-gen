    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 stoloniferum subsp. fuciferum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in full sun to partial shade. It has a creeping growth habit with stolons that allow it to spread and form dense mats. The subspecies fuciferum is distinguished by its more robust growth and the presence of a fleshy, club-shaped base to the flower stem."
