    "intro": "Hedysarum asperum, commonly known as the rough sainfoin, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect, often branched stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum asperum is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. It plays a role in nitrogen fixation due to its symbiotic relationship with rhizobia bacteria."
