    "intro": "Hymenophyllum gardnerianum, commonly known as the Gardner's filmy fern, is a species of fern characterized by its delicate, lace-like fronds. It belongs to the family Hymenophyllaceae and is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocks or tree trunks. Its leaves are thin and translucent, with a unique structure that allows for efficient water retention. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are typically located on the underside of the fronds."
