    "intro": "Hieracium aloysii-villaris, commonly known as the Alpine Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble a single flower. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in harsh, cold environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disc. The species is notable for its ability to spread vegetatively through its rhizomes, making it a persistent and sometimes invasive plant in certain ecosystems."
