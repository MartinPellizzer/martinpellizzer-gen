    "intro": "Hysteria veratrifolia, commonly known as the devil's fig, is a striking plant native to the subtropical regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, fleshy fruits that turn red when mature. Its botanical name reflects its historical association with hysteria, though it is not toxic to humans. Hysteria veratrifolia thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
