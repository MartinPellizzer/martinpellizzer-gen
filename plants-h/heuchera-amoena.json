    "intro": "Heuchera amoena, commonly known as the silver queen heuchera, is a perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, matted foliage that ranges from silver to purple hues. The plant produces upright, spire-like clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for shaded garden beds. Heuchera amoena is also valued for its ornamental leaves and its ability to attract pollinators."
