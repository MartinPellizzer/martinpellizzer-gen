    "intro": "Hieracium auriculoides subsp. sarmentosum, commonly known as the creeping hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing habit with stolons that allow it to spread across the ground, forming dense mats. The plant has hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
