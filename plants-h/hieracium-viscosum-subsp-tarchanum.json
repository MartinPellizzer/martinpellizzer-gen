    "intro": "Hieracium viscosum subsp. tarchanum, commonly known as sticky hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and basal rosettes of broad, lobed leaves. The plant produces small, daisy-like flowers with yellow disc florets and white to pale yellow ray florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. Due to its invasive potential, it is considered a weed in some regions."
