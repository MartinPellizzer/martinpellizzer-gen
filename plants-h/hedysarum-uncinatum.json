    "intro": "Hedysarum uncinatum, commonly known as burr vetch, is a perennial legume native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and its distinctive, hooked fruit pods that aid in seed dispersal. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, meadows, and along roadsides. Hedysarum uncinatum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and as a forage plant for livestock."
