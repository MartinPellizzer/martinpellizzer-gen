    "intro": "Heteropogon glaber var. messanensis, commonly known as the Messanese hairgrass, is a grass species native to southern Europe, particularly Italy. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often in wet meadows or along riverbanks. Its inflorescence consists of a single spikelet that is often hidden within the foliage, making it less conspicuous. This variety is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
