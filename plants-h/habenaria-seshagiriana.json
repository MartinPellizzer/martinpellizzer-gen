    "intro": "Habenaria seshagiriana, commonly known as the Seshagiri's orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Western Ghats of India. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces a single, showy inflorescence with several pale green to white flowers that have a distinctive spurred lip. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
