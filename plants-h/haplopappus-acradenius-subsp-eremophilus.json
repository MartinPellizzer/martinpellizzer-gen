    "intro": "Haplopappus acradenius subsp. eremophilus, commonly known as the desert fleabane, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing perennial with silver-gray foliage and small yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant has a compact growth habit, often forming dense mats to conserve moisture in harsh environments. Its leaves are covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss and reflect sunlight. It is adapted to thrive in poor soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
