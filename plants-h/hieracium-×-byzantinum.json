    "intro": "Hieracium \u00d7 byzantinum, commonly known as the Byzantine hawkweed, is a hybrid perennial herb belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette-forming leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and has been introduced to other regions, where it can become invasive in certain habitats. It thrives in disturbed soils and can tolerate a range of environmental conditions. Due to its aggressive growth, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
