    "intro": "Hyperbaena allenii, commonly known as the Allen's hyperbaena, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton, and is characterized by its showy, five-petaled flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or subshrub, with woody stems and small, narrow leaves. It produces bright yellow or orange flowers that bloom in the summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
