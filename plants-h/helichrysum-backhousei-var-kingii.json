It features dense clusters of small, golden-yellow flowers that resemble tiny sunflowers, blooming throughout the summer months. The plant has silvery-green foliage with a velvety texture, adding visual interest even when not in bloom. It is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Its ornamental value is further enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
