    "intro": "Hieracium vulgatum subsp. tephrofloccum, commonly known as the snowdrop hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale yellow flowers and dense, fluffy flocculent structures on the flower heads."
