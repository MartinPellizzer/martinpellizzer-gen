    "intro": "Hedera helix var. minima, commonly known as the miniature English ivy, is a compact variety of ivy that features small, dark green leaves with a slightly textured surface. It is a climbing or trailing plant that thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments, making it suitable for indoor or outdoor use. The plant produces small, pale greenish-yellow flowers that are not particularly showy, but it is prized for its dense foliage and ability to cover surfaces effectively. It is relatively low maintenance, requiring moderate watering and well-draining soil. This variety is often used in rock gardens, hanging baskets, or as a ground cover due to its compact growth habit."
