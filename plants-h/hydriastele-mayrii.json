    "intro": "Hydriastele mayrii, commonly known as the Mayrii's hydriastele, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the tropical rainforests of Central America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are elongated and lance-shaped, often covered in a fine, waxy coating to reduce water loss. Due to habitat destruction, Hydriastele mayrii is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
