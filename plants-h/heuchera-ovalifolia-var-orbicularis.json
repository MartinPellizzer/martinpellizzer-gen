It features broad, rounded leaves that are typically a vibrant shade of red or purple, though variegated forms also exist. The plant produces upright, spikelike clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and prefers moist, well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental foliage and ease of care, it is a popular choice for woodland gardens and shaded borders."
