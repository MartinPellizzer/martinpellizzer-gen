It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosettes of leaves, which are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in dense clusters, which are arranged in a composite head typical of the daisy family. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks. Hieracium \u00d7 podolicum is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
