It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is notable for its spherical, yellowish flower heads that resemble small globes, hence its common name. It typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 centimeters. Hieracium sphaerelium is an annual or biennial plant, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its widespread distribution."
