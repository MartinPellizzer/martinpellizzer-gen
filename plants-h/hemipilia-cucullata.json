    "intro": "Hemipilia cucullata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive hood-like bracts that encase the inflorescence. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, grass-like leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or greenish-white, with a unique structure that aids in pollination by specific insect species. Hemipilia cucullata is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors and rocky slopes."
