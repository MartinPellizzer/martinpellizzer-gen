    "intro": "Heteropleura, commonly known as the water fern, is a genus of aquatic ferns belonging to the family Marsileaceae. These plants are characterized by their small, floating leaves that are often divided into four parts, resembling a four-leaf clover. Heteropleura species are typically found in freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms and contributing to water filtration. The genus is native to various parts of Asia, Africa, and the Americas, with many species exhibiting adaptability to different water conditions."
