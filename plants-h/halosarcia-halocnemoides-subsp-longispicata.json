It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming structure with fleshy, succulent leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, which are typically arranged in clusters. Its fruits are small, dry capsules that release seeds when mature. This subspecies is commonly found in coastal dunes and salt marshes across the Mediterranean and parts of North Africa."
