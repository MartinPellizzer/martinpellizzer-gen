    "intro": "Hieracium caesiomurorum var. chlorelliceps, commonly known as the green-spored hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant produces a unique type of spore-containing structure called a pappus, which aids in wind dispersal. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and taxonomic studies."
