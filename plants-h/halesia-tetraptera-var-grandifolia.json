    "intro": "Halesia tetraptera var. grandifolia, commonly known as the Appalachian halesia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and clusters of white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, elongated fruits that contain several winged seeds, aiding in wind dispersal. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptic, with a smooth margin and a pointed tip. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in mixed hardwood forests."
