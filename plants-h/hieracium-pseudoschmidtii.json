It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads and opposite leaf arrangement. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, and it produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
