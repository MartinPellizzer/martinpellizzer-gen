    "intro": "Hoodia coleorum, commonly known as the desert apple or khadiya, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, spineless stems that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom during the rainy season, followed by the development of red, fleshy fruits. Hoodia coleorum is also noted for its unique ability to suppress appetite, which has led to its use in weight-loss supplements. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
