    "intro": "Hieracium eversianum, commonly known as the Everlasting Hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its bright yellow flowers bloom in the summer, and it produces small, bristly seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium eversianum is often found in open habitats and can form dense colonies, making it a common weed in agricultural areas."
