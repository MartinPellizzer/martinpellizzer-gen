    "intro": "Hippomarathrum dichotomum, commonly known as the two-branched burrweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically pubescent. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny, two-lobed fruits that are adapted for dispersal by animals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a notable species in the study of desert flora and ecological adaptation."
