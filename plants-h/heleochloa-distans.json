    "intro": "Heleochloa distans, commonly known as the distant hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, spikelet-bearing inflorescences. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in meadows or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and often have a slight waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Heleochloa distans is valued in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various insects and small animals."
