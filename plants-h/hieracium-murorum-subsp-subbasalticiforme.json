    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. subbasalticiforme, commonly known as the basaltic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to rocky and alpine environments. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its robust, upright growth habit and the presence of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained, calcareous soils, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized plant in its native range."
