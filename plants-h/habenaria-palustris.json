    "intro": "Habenaria palustris, commonly known as the marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often arranged in a raceme. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems. Habenaria palustris is an important species for pollinators and is often found in association with other wetland flora."
