It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
