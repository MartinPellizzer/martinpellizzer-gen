    "intro": "Helxine dioscoridis, commonly known as the creeping bellflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is a low-growing perennial that forms dense mats of foliage, with small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its leaves are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are prostrate and often root at the nodes. Helxine dioscoridis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in shaded environments."
