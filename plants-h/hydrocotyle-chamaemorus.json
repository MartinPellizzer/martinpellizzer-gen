    "intro": "Hydrocotyle chamaemorus, commonly known as marsh pennywort, is a low-growing perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It thrives in wet, muddy environments such as marshes, bogs, and the edges of ponds. The plant has small, rounded leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in diameter, arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbels, and it produces small, dark berries as fruit. Hydrocotyle chamaemorus plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic invertebrates."
