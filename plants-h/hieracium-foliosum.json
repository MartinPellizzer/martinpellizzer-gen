    "intro": "Hieracium foliosum, commonly known as the leafy hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium foliosum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
