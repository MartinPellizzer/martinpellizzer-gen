It features upright, often sparsely branched stems covered in small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture, and are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This plant is notable for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
