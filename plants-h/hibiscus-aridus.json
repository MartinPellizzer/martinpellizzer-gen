    "intro": "Hibiscus aridus, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and leaves that are adapted to conserve water. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or red, which bloom in the morning and close in the heat of the day. Hibiscus aridus is a succulent, capable of storing water in its tissues, making it well-suited for drought conditions. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to survive in harsh, dry environments."
