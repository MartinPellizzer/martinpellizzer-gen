It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months.
