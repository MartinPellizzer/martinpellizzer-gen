    "intro": "Hypericum stenophyllum, commonly known as narrow-leaved St. John's wort, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged oppositely along the stem. Hypericum stenophyllum is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. It is a member of the family Hypericaceae and is noted for its medicinal properties, though its use is less common compared to other Hypericum species."
