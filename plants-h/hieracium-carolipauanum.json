It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and leafy stems. The plant typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces yellow to orange flowers in clusters. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
