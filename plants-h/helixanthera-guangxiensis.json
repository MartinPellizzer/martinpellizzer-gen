    "intro": "Helixanthera guangxiensis, commonly known as the Guangxi helixanthera, is a rare and endemic flowering plant native to southern China. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as mountain forests, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in a fine, velvety texture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect its natural habitat."
