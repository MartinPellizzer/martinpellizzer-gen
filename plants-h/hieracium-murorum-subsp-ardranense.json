It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its yellow composite flowers and hairy stems. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, more compact growth habit compared to other members of the *Hieracium* genus. It typically thrives in grassy habitats and is often found in disturbed soils. The plant's morphology reflects adaptations to its specific ecological niche within its native range."
