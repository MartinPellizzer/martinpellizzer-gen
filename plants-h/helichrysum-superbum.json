    "intro": "Helichrysum superbum, commonly known as the golden marguerite or everlasting, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and produces clusters of small, yellow to orange flowers that resemble daisies. The plant is drought-tolerant and thrives in full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, and the flowers retain their color for a long time after drying, which is why it is often used in floral arrangements. Helichrysum superbum is also valued for its aromatic properties and is sometimes used in herbal remedies."
