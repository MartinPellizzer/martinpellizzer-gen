    "intro": "Hieracium pichleri subsp. chloripedunculatum, commonly known as the green-stemmed hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellowish composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its greenish stems and shorter, more compact inflorescences compared to other hawkweed species. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic plant."
