    "intro": "Heliconia trichocarpa, commonly known as the crimson heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous inflorescences that consist of brightly colored bracts surrounding small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow flowers that are pollinated by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and color. Its leaves are large, elliptical, and often have a waxy texture. Heliconia trichocarpa is also valued for its ornamental use in gardens and as a source of plant material for traditional crafts."
