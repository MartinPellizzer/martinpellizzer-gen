    "intro": "Humboltia tripterantha, commonly known as the coastal nightshade, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically purple or violet in color. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, aiding in its dispersal. Humboltia tripterantha is often found in sandy or rocky soils along coastal dunes and cliffs."
