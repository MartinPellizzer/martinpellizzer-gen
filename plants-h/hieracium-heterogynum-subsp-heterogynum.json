    "intro": "Hieracium heterogynum subsp. heterogynum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads composed of numerous small florets. The plant typically features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which are pollinated by insects. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with fine hairs, and it often grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The species is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both a common weed and a potential indicator of soil disturbance."
