    "intro": "Hypocalymma scariosum, commonly known as the scarious hypocalymma, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes citrus plants, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant produces yellow to orange flowers that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. It has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. Hypocalymma scariosum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
