    "intro": "Hieracium atratum var. subnigrescens, commonly known as the black-tinged hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its dark green, hairy leaves and yellowish to reddish flower heads that darken with age. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, this plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows and roadside areas. The flowers consist of both ray and disk florets, typical of the Asteraceae family, and bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its subspecies name, *subnigrescens*, refers to the darkening of the flower heads as they mature."
