It features small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, typically arranged in compact clusters. The plant has slender, woody stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or dry habitats. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to other members of the Hypericaceae family."
