    "intro": "Hieracium lopholepis, commonly known as the rough hawksbeard, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides, meadows, and waste areas. The plant features a basal rosette of spiny, rough-textured leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late summer. Its flowering heads consist of numerous small florets arranged in a disc-like structure, typical of the Asteraceae family. Hieracium lopholepis is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to thrive in nutrient-poor soils."
