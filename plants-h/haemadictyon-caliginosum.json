    "intro": "Haemadictyon caliginosum, commonly known as the misty fern, is a delicate perennial plant native to the wetlands of Southeast Asia. It features finely divided, feather-like leaves that give it a lacy appearance, adapted for capturing moisture from the humid environment. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or brown, which are followed by spore-bearing capsules. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly across moist soil, forming dense mats. The plant thrives in shaded, waterlogged conditions, making it a characteristic species of swampy and marshy habitats."
