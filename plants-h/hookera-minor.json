It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its small, bell-shaped blue or violet flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, delicate fruits. Hookera minor is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to cold and high-altitude conditions."
