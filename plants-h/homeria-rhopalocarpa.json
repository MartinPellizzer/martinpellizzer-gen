    "intro": "Homeria rhopalocarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and canyons. The tree is valued for its hard, durable wood and its role in providing habitat for various wildlife species."
