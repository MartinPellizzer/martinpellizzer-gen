    "intro": "Hemionitis pygmaea, commonly known as the dwarf water fern, is a small aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and marshes, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. The plant has delicate, feathery fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hemionitis pygmaea plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for microorganisms and small invertebrates."
