    "intro": "Hidalgoa, commonly known as the desert bell, is a genus of flowering plants native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plants typically have hairy stems and leaves, adapted to conserve water in harsh environments. Hidalgoa species are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in full sun, making them well-suited for desert landscapes. They are also valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
