It is native to North America and thrives in moist to wet habitats, such as marshes and along stream banks. The plant features tall, stiff stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, supporting its showy, bright orange to red flower heads. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a rough texture, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Helenium longifolium is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
