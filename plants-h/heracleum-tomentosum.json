    "intro": "Heracleum tomentosum, commonly known as cow parsnip, is a flowering plant in the carrot family (Apiaceae). It is native to North America and is characterized by its large, umbrella-shaped white flowers and hairy, fern-like leaves. The plant can grow up to 2 meters tall and is often found in moist, disturbed areas such as meadows and stream banks. Its stems and leaves are covered in fine hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant contains toxic compounds, particularly in its sap, which can cause skin irritation."
