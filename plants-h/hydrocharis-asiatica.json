    "intro": "Hydrocharis asiatica, commonly known as the Asiatic water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to East Asia. It has heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom above the water surface. Its roots help stabilize sediment in wetland ecosystems. Hydrocharis asiatica is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats."
