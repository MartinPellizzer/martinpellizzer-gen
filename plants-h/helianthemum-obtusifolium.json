    "intro": "Helianthemum obtusifolium, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a low-growing shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has fleshy, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid environments. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in poor, well-drained soils."
