    "intro": "Habenella schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's habenula, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its unique, palmate leaves and showy, violet-colored flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within rainforests, where it relies on specific symbiotic relationships with fungi for nutrient uptake. Its limited distribution and specialized habitat make it a subject of interest for botanists studying plant adaptation and conservation. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and requires protection to ensure its survival."
