    "intro": "Hieracium cryptanthum subsp. venascanum, commonly known as the Venascanum hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands, roadsides, and meadows. The plant features a basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow ray florets surrounded by a cluster of tubular disc florets. Its leaves are usually hairy and have a rough texture, while the stems are erect and often branched. The species is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
