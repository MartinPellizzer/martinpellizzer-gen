    "intro": "Hydrophila vaillantii, commonly known as the water hyacinth, is a floating herbaceous plant native to South America. It features broad, waxy leaves that are typically bright green and buoyant, allowing it to float on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant produces showy, violet-blue flowers that bloom in dense clusters, often resembling those of the true hyacinth. Hydrophila vaillantii is known for its rapid growth rate, which can lead to dense mats covering water surfaces. It is often considered an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
