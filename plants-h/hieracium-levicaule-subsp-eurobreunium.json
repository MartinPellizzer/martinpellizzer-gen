    "intro": "Hieracium levicaule subsp. eurobreunium, commonly known as the European slender hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its erect, hairy stems and small, yellowish flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster. The leaves are typically lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in disturbed soils and can be found in grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides. This subspecies is often mistaken for other hawkweed species due to its similar morphology."
