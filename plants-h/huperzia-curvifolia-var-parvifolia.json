    "intro": "Huperzia curvifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaf huperzia, is a species of clubmoss native to the southeastern United States. It is a low-growing, evergreen plant characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces sporangia in clusters on the underside of its leaves, which are released during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its unique morphology and ecological role make it an important component of its native habitat."
