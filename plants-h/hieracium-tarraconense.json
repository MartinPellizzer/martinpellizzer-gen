    "intro": "Hieracium tarraconense, commonly known as the Tarraconense hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow composite flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as rocky soils and open grasslands. It has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fluffy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
