    "intro": "Holcus \u00d7 hybridus, commonly known as the meadow foxtail, is a perennial grass species that hybridizes between Holcus lanatus and Holcus mollis. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth and spikelet clusters that mature into bristly, spike-like structures. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along roadsides. Its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy, while the inflorescence is a cylindrical spike that can reach up to 30 cm in height. Holcus \u00d7 hybridus plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various invertebrates."
