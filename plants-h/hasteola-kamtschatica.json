    "intro": "Hasteola kamtschatica, commonly known as the Kamchatka grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Asia. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and subarctic regions. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hair. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, spikelet-like flowers that bloom in early summer. Hasteola kamtschatica plays a vital role in stabilizing soil in its harsh native environment and is adapted to survive long, cold winters."
