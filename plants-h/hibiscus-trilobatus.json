    "intro": "Hibiscus trilobatus, commonly known as the swamp hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in wet, swampy areas and along the edges of ponds. The plant features large, showy flowers that are usually pink to red in color, with five deeply notched petals. Its leaves are heart-shaped and often have a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in humid environments. Hibiscus trilobatus is known for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in moist, nutrient-rich soils."
