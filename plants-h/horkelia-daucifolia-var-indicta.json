It is characterized by its striking red, orange, or yellow bracts that resemble paintbrushes, which are actually modified leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun, often found in dry, open habitats. Its flowers are small and clustered, with a distinctive structure that aids in pollination by insects. This variety is part of the Boraginaceae family and is known for its ornamental value in native plant gardens."
