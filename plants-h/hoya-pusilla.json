    "intro": "Hoya pusilla, commonly known as the miniature wax plant, is a compact, trailing species native to Southeast Asia. It features small, waxy, ovate leaves that are typically light green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of star-shaped, fragrant flowers in shades of white or pale pink, which bloom in response to bright light and warmth. Hoya pusilla thrives in well-draining soil and requires moderate watering to prevent root rot. It is a popular choice for hanging baskets or shelf displays due to its compact size and ease of care."
