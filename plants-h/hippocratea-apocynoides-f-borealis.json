    "intro": "Hippocratea apocynoides f. borealis, commonly known as the northern hippocratea, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the northern regions of South America. It belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which includes milkweeds and related species known for their showy flowers and often milky sap. The plant is characterized by its vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
