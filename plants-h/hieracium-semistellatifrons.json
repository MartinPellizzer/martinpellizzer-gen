It is characterized by its hairy stems and basal rosette of leaves, which help it survive in dry, disturbed habitats. The plant produces yellow composite flowers that are arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, typical of the daisy family. Its leaves are typically lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in meadows and grassy areas. Hieracium semistellatifrons is a perennial species that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes."
