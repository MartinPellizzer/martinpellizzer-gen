It belongs to the Scrophulariaceae family and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are opposite and lance-shaped, with hairy surfaces that help reduce water loss.
