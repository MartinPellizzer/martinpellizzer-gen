It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers that resemble small suns. The plant is perennial, producing dense clusters of small, daisy-like blooms throughout the growing season.

Helichrysum aureolum is often used in dried flower arrangements due to its long-lasting, crisp petals."
