    "intro": "Helianthemum lasianthum var. cheiranthoides, commonly known as the rock rose or cushion plant, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces showy yellow flowers in early summer, which are clustered in compact inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its succulent leaves help it retain moisture, allowing it to survive in arid environments."
