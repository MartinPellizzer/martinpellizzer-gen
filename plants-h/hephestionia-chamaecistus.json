    "intro": "Hephestionia chamaecistus, commonly known as the rock dandelion, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, thriving in dry and sunny environments. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves and produces yellow flowers in early spring. Its flowers are followed by distinctive, elongated seed pods that release seeds with tufts of hair for wind dispersal. Hephestionia chamaecistus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in rocky gardens and alpine settings."
