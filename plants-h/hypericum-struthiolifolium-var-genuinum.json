    "intro": "Hypericum struthiolifolium var. genuinum, commonly known as the yellow-flowered St. John's wort, is a perennial shrub native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated margin, and the plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits in autumn. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or wildflower meadows. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
