    "intro": "Hieracium piliferum subsp. subnivale, commonly known as the snowgrass hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. It thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its floral structure is typical of the Asteraceae family, featuring composite flower heads composed of numerous tiny florets."
