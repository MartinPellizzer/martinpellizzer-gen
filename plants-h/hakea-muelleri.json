    "intro": "Hakea muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's hakea, is a shrub native to southwestern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical or globose spikes of bright red or orange flowers that appear in late summer to autumn. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. It produces woody, cone-like fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by animals and wind. Hakea muelleri is well adapted to dry conditions and is often found in heathlands and open woodlands."
