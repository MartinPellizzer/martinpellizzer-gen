    "intro": "Hieracium relaxatum, commonly known as the meadow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped leaves and yellow composite flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands across Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and produces numerous small, seed-like structures called cypselae. Hieracium relaxatum is often found in disturbed soils and can spread readily through vegetative reproduction."
