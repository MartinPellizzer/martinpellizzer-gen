It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers that bloom in late summer, contrasting beautifully with its grass-like leaves. The plant belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family and is known for its ability to thrive in well-drained soil and full sun. Its bulbous root system allows it to store water and nutrients, making it drought-tolerant. The flowers are tubular and often attract pollinators such as bees and birds."
