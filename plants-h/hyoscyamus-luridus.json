    "intro": "Hyoscyamus luridus, commonly known as the yellow bell or wild jimsonweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the nightshade family (Solanaceae) and is characterized by its yellow, bell-shaped flowers and hairy, branched stems. The plant produces small, green, fleshy fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in dry, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wastelands. Due to its toxic alkaloids, it is considered a noxious weed in some regions."
