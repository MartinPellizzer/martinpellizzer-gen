    "intro": "Huernia hadhramautica, commonly known as the Hadhramaut horned cactus, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of the Arabian Peninsula. It features a thick, ribbed stem covered in short, white spines, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, typically blooming in the spring. Its leaves are modified into spines, and the stem stores water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. It is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its hardy nature and unique appearance."
