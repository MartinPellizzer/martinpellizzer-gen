    "intro": "Hypogomphia nana, commonly known as the dwarf hypogomphia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with compact, rosette-like foliage. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers during the spring and early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in a fine, fuzzy layer of hair, which helps to retain moisture. Hypogomphia nana is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and rocky slopes."
