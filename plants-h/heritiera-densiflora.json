It is characterized by its woody structure and is typically found in moist, lowland areas of Southeast Asia. The plant features palmate leaves with five to seven lobes and produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds.
