    "intro": "Heliocereus heterodoxus, commonly known as the sun cactus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It belongs to the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces large, showy flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which open at night and emit a sweet fragrance. It thrives in arid environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and nocturnal flowering habit, it is a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts of desert flora."
