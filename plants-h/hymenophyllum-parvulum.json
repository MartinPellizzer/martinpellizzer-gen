    "intro": "Hymenophyllum parvulum, commonly known as the small-leaf filmy fern, is a small, epiphytic fern found in moist, shaded environments. It has delicate, translucent fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant's rhizomes are short and often covered in a fine, moss-like layer. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum parvulum is a member of the Hymenophyllaceae family and is characterized by its unique, thin, and often hairy leaf surfaces."
