    "intro": "Hazardia squarrosa var. obtusa, commonly known as the wooly sunhemp, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a member of the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and ability to fix nitrogen, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
