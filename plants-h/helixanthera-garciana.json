    "intro": "Helixanthera garciana, commonly known as the Garcian helix, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes many species of shrubs and vines. The plant is characterized by its spirally arranged leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically white or pale pink. Its flowers are adapted for pollination by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar production. Helixanthera garciana is often found in humid, shaded environments such as forest understories."
