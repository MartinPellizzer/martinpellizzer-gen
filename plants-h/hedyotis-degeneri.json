    "intro": "Hedyotis degeneri, commonly known as the small yellow toadflax, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a waxy texture. Hedyotis degeneri is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense colonies."
