    "intro": "Hieracium murorum subsp. semicontractum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe. It typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and meadows. The plant features basal rosettes of lanceolate, hairy leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in the summer. Its inflorescence consists of a single capitulum surrounded by pale green bracts. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and narrower leaves compared to other hawkweed species."
