    "intro": "Hieracium durum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, reaching heights of up to 60 cm. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium durum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread through rhizomes."
