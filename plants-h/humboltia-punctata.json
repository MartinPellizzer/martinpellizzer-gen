    "intro": "Humboltia punctata, commonly known as the California buckeye, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically five to seven lobes, and its distinctive yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, spiny fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a critical food source for certain wildlife species. Humboltia punctata is adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Its botanical features make it an important component of the local ecosystem and a subject of interest in botanical studies."
