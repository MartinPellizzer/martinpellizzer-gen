    "intro": "Haemanthus quadrivalvis, commonly known as the four-valved haemanthus, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features a basal rosette of narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bright red, tubular flowers that open in late summer. Its unique floral structure is adapted for pollination by birds, particularly sunbirds. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its dramatic winter blooms."
