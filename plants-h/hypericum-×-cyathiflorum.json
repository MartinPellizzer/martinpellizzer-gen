It features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, typically in clusters at the ends of its stems. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period and ability to attract pollinators."
