    "intro": "Hoya pilosa, commonly known as the velvet tangle, is a species of flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thick, waxy leaves that are covered in fine, short hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Hoya pilosa is a climbing or trailing plant that thrives in bright, indirect light and well-draining soil. It is popular among houseplant enthusiasts for its attractive foliage and relatively low maintenance requirements."
