    "intro": "Haplophyllum tchihatchewii, commonly known as the mountain holly, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Caucasus region. It is a member of the Ericaceae family, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and evergreen foliage. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a slight waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its arid environment. Haplophyllum tchihatchewii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
