    "intro": "Homocolleticon, commonly known as the saddlebag moth, is a genus of moths in the family Tortricidae. These moths are characterized by their distinctive, saddle-shaped wings that are often brightly colored. The larvae of Homocolleticon species are typically leaf rollers, feeding on a variety of plants including trees and shrubs. Their life cycle involves several stages, including egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Botanically, they are of interest due to their interactions with host plants and their role in ecological systems."
