    "intro": "Haemanthus canaliculatus, commonly known as the blood lily, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to South Africa. It features a rosette of narrow, strap-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy bloom of white or pale green. The plant produces striking red or orange flowers in late winter to early spring, which are borne on tall, leafless stems. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that help it survive dry periods. Haemanthus canaliculatus is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal."
