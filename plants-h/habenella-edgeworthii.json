    "intro": "Habenella edgeworthii, commonly known as the Edgeworth's habenula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic compounds. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in shaded, rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
