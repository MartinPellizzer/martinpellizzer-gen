    "intro": "Habenaria crassifolia, commonly known as the broad-leaved marsh orchid, is a species of orchid native to wetlands and marshy areas in tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its broad, grass-like leaves and its delicate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white, pink, or purple. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in moist environments. Its roots are often mycorrhizal, forming symbiotic relationships with fungi to enhance nutrient absorption. This orchid is an important component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and ecological balance."
