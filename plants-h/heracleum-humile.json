    "intro": "Heracleum humile, commonly known as the dwarf cow parsnip, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its tall, hollow stems and fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to greenish-yellow flowers arranged in umbrella-like clusters called umbels. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its resemblance to toxic look-alikes, it is important to correctly identify Heracleum humile to avoid confusion with more dangerous species."
