    "intro": "Hieracium hispidum, commonly known as the hispid hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are rough and hairy, giving it a distinctive texture, while its yellow flowers bloom in late summer. Hieracium hispidum is often found in open habitats and can spread aggressively through its rhizomes."
