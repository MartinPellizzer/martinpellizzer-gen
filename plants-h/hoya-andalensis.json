    "intro": "Hoya andalensis, commonly known as the Andalusian waxplant, is a species of flowering plant native to southern Europe, particularly Spain. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy stems and clusters of waxy, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and prefers well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Hoya andalensis is a slow-growing plant that can be propagated through stem cuttings. Its unique appearance and low maintenance make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
