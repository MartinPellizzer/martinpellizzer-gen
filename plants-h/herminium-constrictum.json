    "intro": "Herminium constrictum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved twayblade, is a perennial orchid native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is a hemiparasite, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. Its unique botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and botanical study."
