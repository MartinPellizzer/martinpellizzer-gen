    "intro": "Hakea cincta, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its narrow, needle-like leaves that are often covered in a fine, white bloom, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces cylindrical, woody cones that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in coastal areas and sandy soils, often growing in open habitats. Hakea cincta is well adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds, making it a resilient species in harsh environments."
