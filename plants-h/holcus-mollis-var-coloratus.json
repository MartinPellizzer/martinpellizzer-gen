    "intro": "Holcus mollis var. coloratus, commonly known as the purple false brome, is a perennial grass species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves and dense, tufted growth habit. The plant typically grows in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its flowering spikes are slender and bear small, spikelet-like flowers, which are usually green or brown. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local insect populations."
