    "intro": "Heliophila carponematoides, commonly known as the creeping marsh woundwort, is a flowering plant native to wetland and marsh environments. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with thin, branching stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale purple flowers arranged in spike-like clusters, typically blooming in late summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Heliophila carponematoides plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
