    "intro": "Hippocrepis comosa var. alpestris, commonly known as the Alpine horned poppy, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is a member of the Papaveraceae family, characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its hairy, glandular stems and leaves are adapted to withstand cold temperatures and high-altitude conditions. This variety is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of Hippocrepis comosa."
