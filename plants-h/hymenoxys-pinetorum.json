    "intro": "Hymenoxys pinetorum, commonly known as the pine tree dandelion, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, blue-green leaves and its showy yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, oval fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and pine forests. Hymenoxys pinetorum is adapted to arid environments and has a short growing season."
