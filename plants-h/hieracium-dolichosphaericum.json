    "intro": "Hieracium dolichosphaericum, commonly known as the long-sphere hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces numerous yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence. Native to Europe, it thrives in meadows and grasslands, often in sunny, well-drained soils. The plant has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies. Its flowers are typically visited by various pollinators, including bees and flies, contributing to its ecological role in open habitats."
