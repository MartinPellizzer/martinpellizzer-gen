    "intro": "Hapalocarpum, commonly known as the \"gum tree\" or \"kapok tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers and the production of a sticky, resinous gum. The plants are typically found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. Hapalocarpum species are often deciduous, shedding their leaves seasonally in response to environmental changes. The genus includes several species, some of which are valued for their ornamental appeal and others for their ecological importance in native habitats."
