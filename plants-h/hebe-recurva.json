    "intro": "Hebe recurva, commonly known as the silver tuft hebe, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage that provides a striking contrast to its purple or red flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features compact, upright growth habit. Its flowers are tubular and appear in clusters, often blooming in spring and summer. Hebe recurva is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its ornamental appeal and hardiness."
