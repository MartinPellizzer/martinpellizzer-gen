It features distinctive, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, early spring flowers in shades of blue, white, and purple, with five petals and a central yellow or green blotch. Its flowers are typically followed by clusters of small, greenish-yellow berries that mature in late summer. The species is adapted to woodland habitats and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
