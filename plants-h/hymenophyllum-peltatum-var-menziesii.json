    "intro": "Hymenophyllum peltatum var. menziesii, commonly known as the Menzies' filmy fern, is a delicate, epiphytic fern belonging to the Hymenophyllaceae family. It is characterized by its finely divided, translucent fronds that are often less than 1 cm in width. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found on tree trunks or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. The species is noted for its intricate morphology and is often used in botanical studies to understand fern evolution and ecology."
