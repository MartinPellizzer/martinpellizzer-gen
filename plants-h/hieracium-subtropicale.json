    "intro": "Hieracium subtropicale, commonly known as the subtropical hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to regions with warm climates. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically features yellow to orange flowers arranged in a flat-topped cluster, with hairy stems and leaves. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas such as roadsides and disturbed sites. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
