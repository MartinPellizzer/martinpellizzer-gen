    "intro": "Hieracium viride subsp. penninicola, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky or gravelly soils. The plant features a rosette of basal leaves that are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, with a central stem that bears yellow flowers in a single head. Its flowers are surrounded by pale green to white ray florets, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in cold, harsh environments. It plays a role in stabilizing soil in alpine ecosystems and is often found in meadows and slopes at high altitudes."
