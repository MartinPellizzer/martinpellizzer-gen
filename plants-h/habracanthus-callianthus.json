    "intro": "Habracanthus callianthus, commonly known as the African star-of-Bethlehem, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking blue or purple star-shaped flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, round seeds enclosed in a fleshy, yellowish capsule. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is often cultivated in arid regions."
