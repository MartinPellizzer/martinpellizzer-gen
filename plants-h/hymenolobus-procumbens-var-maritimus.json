    "intro": "Hymenolobus procumbens var. maritimus, commonly known as the coastal hymenolobus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to coastal regions. It is characterized by its prostrate stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal racemes. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and wind exposure. This variant is particularly important for stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
