    "intro": "Habenaria chejuensis, commonly known as the Jeju orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the island of Jeju in South Korea. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in a raceme, which are typically short-lived but attract specific pollinators. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
