    "intro": "Hydrocotyle dissecta, commonly known as the dissected marsh penny. It is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland environments in North America. The plant features delicate, lobed leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapted to aquatic or semi-aquatic habitats. Its small white flowers bloom in the summer, and it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Hydrocotyle dissecta is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to thrive in disturbed water environments."
