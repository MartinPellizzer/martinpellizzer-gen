    "intro": "Henckelia ramosa, commonly known as the ramose henckelia, is a flowering plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with multiple branched stems and small, palmate leaves. It produces showy, five-petaled flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
