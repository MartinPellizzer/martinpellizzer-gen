    "intro": "Habenaria kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu Orchid, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively in the high-altitude regions of Mount Kinabalu in Borneo. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its delicate, pale greenish-yellow flowers with intricate markings. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments, typically growing on rock surfaces or in shaded forest areas. Its specialized adaptations allow it to survive in the unique microclimate of the mountain's summit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
