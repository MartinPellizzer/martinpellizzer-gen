    "intro": "Hemsleya, commonly known as the \"dove's foot\" or \"southern cross,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rubiaceae. These plants are typically small shrubs or herbs, native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They are characterized by their opposite, often hairy leaves and small, clustered flowers that can be white, yellow, or red. Hemsleya species usually thrive in moist, shaded environments and are often found in forest understories. The genus is named in honor of the British botanist William Botting Hemsley."
