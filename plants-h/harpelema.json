    "intro": "Harpelema, commonly known as the giant water lily, is a striking aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to two meters in diameter, floating on the surface of freshwater bodies. The plant's flowers are large, showy, and typically appear in late summer, with white petals and a yellow center. Harpelema plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its roots help stabilize the sediment, preventing erosion in waterways."
