    "intro": "Hypericum pamphylicum, commonly known as the Eastern St. John's Wort, is a flowering plant native to southeastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in open woodland or scrub habitats. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and slightly serrated, and it has woody stems that become more pronounced with age. Hypericum pamphylicum is noted for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its historical use in traditional medicine."
