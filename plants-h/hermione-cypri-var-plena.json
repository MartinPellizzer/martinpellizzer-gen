    "intro": "Hermione cypri var. plena, commonly known as the Double Hermione Cypri, is a compact, bushy shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features showy, double flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a fluffy appearance due to the abundance of petals. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive silvery-green hue. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils. This variety is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
