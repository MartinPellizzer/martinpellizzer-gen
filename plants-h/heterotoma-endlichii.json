    "intro": "Heterotoma endlichii, commonly known as the Endlicher's heterotoma, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae, which includes bellflowers, and is characterized by its showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in a fine, hairy coating, while its flowers range in color from blue to purple. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heterotoma endlichii is considered a rare and specialized species."
