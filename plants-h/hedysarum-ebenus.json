    "intro": "Hedysarum ebenus, commonly known as the redstem milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems that are typically reddish in color, and its trifoliate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Hedysarum ebenus is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. It is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in arid environments."
