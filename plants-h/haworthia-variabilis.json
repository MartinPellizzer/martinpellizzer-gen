    "intro": "Haworthia variabilis, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features distinctive, fleshy, triangular leaves with white to yellowish markings that resemble a zebra's stripes. The plant typically grows in a rosette formation, and its leaves are thick and waxy, adapted to store water. It produces small, white flowers on tall, slender stems during the summer months. Haworthia variabilis thrives in bright, indirect light and requires minimal water, making it an ideal houseplant for beginners."
