    "intro": "Hieracium florentinum subsp. ericetorum, commonly known as the ericaceous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers in late summer. The plant typically grows in acidic, nutrient-poor soils, often found in heathlands and moorlands. It is relatively short-lived and can form dense colonies, which may impact local vegetation. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and localized species in certain regions."
