    "intro": "Helia arborea, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a deciduous plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are usually covered in a fine, silvery down, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, which are typically white or pale yellow. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Helia arborea is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
