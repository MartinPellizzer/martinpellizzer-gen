    "intro": "Hedera helix var. minor-marmorata, commonly known as the marble evergreen ivy, is a variant of the common ivy characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage. Its leaves are typically smaller than those of the standard Hedera helix, with a mottled pattern of green, white, and sometimes yellow. This plant is a climbing evergreen vine that thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by dark berries, though these are less prominent than its ornamental foliage. The marble evergreen ivy is valued for its aesthetic appeal and is often used in horticultural settings for ground cover or as a decorative climbing plant."
