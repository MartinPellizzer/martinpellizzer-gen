    "intro": "Hedysarum lanseum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf milkvetch, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial legume that typically grows in rocky or dry soils, often found in alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several narrow, linear leaflets. Hedysarum lanseum is valued for its ecological role in nitrogen fixation and its potential use in restoration projects."
