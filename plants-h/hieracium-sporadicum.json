    "intro": "Hieracium sporadicum, commonly known as the sporadic hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk florets. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and woodland edges. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium sporadicum is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
