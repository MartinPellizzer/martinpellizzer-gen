    "intro": "Huperzia bucahwangensis, commonly known as the Bucanhwang Huperzia, is a species of moss belonging to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its erect, leathery stems and small, ovate leaves that are often covered in a layer of fine, white tomentum. This plant is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. It plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various invertebrates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species in its native range."
