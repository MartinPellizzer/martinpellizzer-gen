    "intro": "Hieracium megalolepium, commonly known as the giant hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a robust root system and can grow up to 1.5 meters tall, making it a notable presence in its native habitats. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. However, it is considered an invasive species in many regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
