    "intro": "Hieracium progenitum, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its yellowish-orange composite flowers and basal rosettes of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as meadows and roadsides. It produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread. Due to its invasive nature, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
