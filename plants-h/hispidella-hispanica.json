    "intro": "Hispidella hispanica, commonly known as the Spanish thistle, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its spiny, lobed leaves and purple to pink flowers that bloom in summer. The plant is an annual or biennial species, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has adapted to thrive in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant's hairy stems and leaves give it a rough, hispid appearance, which is reflected in its scientific name."
