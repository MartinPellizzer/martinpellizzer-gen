    "intro": "Hedyotis rudis, commonly known as the small-leaved bedstraw, is a flowering plant native to temperate regions of Asia and Europe. It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features small, opposite leaves that are usually covered in fine hairs, and it produces clusters of tiny, white or pale yellow flowers. Its reproductive system relies on wind pollination, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Hedyotis rudis is often found in wetland habitats and is valued for its ornamental qualities in horticulture."
