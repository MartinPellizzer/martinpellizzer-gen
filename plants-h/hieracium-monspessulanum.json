    "intro": "Hieracium monspessulanum, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its yellow-orange composite flowers and hairy stems. The plant typically grows in grassy areas, meadows, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. It has serrated leaves and produces seeds in a distinctive disk-like structure. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural settings."
