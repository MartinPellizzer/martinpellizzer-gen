    "intro": "Hypochaeris ibarii, commonly known as the Italian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in open, sunny areas such as meadows and grasslands, and it produces small yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. Hypochaeris ibarii has hairy stems and leaves, and it is often found in disturbed soils. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
