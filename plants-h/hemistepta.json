    "intro": "Hemistepta, commonly known as the \"sicklepod\" or \"bitterbush,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. These plants are typically shrubs or small trees native to the Americas, particularly Central and South America. They are characterized by their compound leaves and small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Hemistepta species often have a woody stem and can thrive in a variety of soil types, though they prefer well-drained conditions. They are sometimes used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
