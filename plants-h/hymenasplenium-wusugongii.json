    "intro": "Hymenasplenium wusugongii, commonly known as the Wusugong spleenwort, is a rare and unique member of the Hemionitidaceae family. It is a small, epiphytic fern that typically grows on the bark of trees in humid, shaded environments. The plant has finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of tiny, scale-like structures. It is native to China and is found in specific regions of Sichuan Province. Due to its limited distribution and habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
