    "intro": "Heliconia ferdinando-coburgi, commonly known as the Ferdinand-Coburg heliconia, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Heliconiaceae family and is characterized by its large, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant produces inflorescences that are often red, orange, or yellow, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense clumps, making it a popular ornamental plant in tropical gardens. The leaves are broad and elongated, contributing to its lush, tropical appearance."
