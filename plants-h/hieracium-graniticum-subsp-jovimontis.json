    "intro": "Hieracium graniticum subsp. jovimontis, commonly known as the granite hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals. The plant thrives in nutrient-poor, rocky soils, often found on granite outcrops and mountain slopes. It has small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss in harsh environments. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found in high-altitude habitats."
