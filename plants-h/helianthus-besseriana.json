    "intro": "Helianthus besseriana, commonly known as the Bessera sunflower, is a species of flowering plant in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it typically grows in dry, rocky habitats. The plant features bright yellow ray florets surrounding a central disk of smaller, tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It produces achenes, or small, dry fruits, that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its propagation. Helianthus besseriana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
