    "intro": "Hypolepis galapagensis, commonly known as the Gal\u00e1pagos water fern, is a species of fern native to the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that are typically bioluminescent in the dark. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found near water sources such as streams and ponds. Its rhizomes spread horizontally, allowing it to colonize new areas effectively. The fronds are composed of small, finger-like segments called pinnae, which are arranged in a distinctive, elegant pattern."
