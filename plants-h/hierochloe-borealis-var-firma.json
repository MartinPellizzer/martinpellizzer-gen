    "intro": "Hierochloe borealis var. firma, commonly known as Arctic hairgrass, is a low-growing, herbaceous plant native to cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. This variant is known for its hardy nature, thriving in nutrient-poor, well-drained soils and often found in alpine or tundra environments. Its growth habit is prostrate, allowing it to spread across the ground and form dense mats. The plant plays a role in stabilizing soil in harsh environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects."
