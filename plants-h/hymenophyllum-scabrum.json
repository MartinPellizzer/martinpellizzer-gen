    "intro": "Hymenophyllum scabrum, commonly known as the rough leathery fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Asia and the Pacific. It features delicate, leathery fronds that are typically dark green and covered with a dense, scaly texture. The plant grows on tree trunks and rocks, thriving in humid, shaded environments. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Hymenophyllum scabrum is valued for its unique appearance and is often cultivated in shaded garden settings."
