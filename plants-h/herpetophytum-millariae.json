It is characterized by its unique, star-shaped flowers that are often brightly colored, with a distinctive central spur. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in its native habitat. Its leaves are usually dark green and fleshy, adapted to store water in the arid environments it inhabits. The species is prized by botanists and horticulturists for its ornamental value and ecological significance."
