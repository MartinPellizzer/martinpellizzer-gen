It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are yellow with ray florets. Hieracium curtifolium is often found in open habitats and can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in certain areas."
