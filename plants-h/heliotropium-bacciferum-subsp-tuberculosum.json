    "intro": "Heliotropium bacciferum subsp. tuberculosum, commonly known as the tuberculate heliotrope, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to violet, often resembling those of other heliotrope species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are usually ovate or elliptical with a slightly hairy surface. The subspecies is distinguished by the presence of tubercles, or small bumps, on its stems and leaves, which are a key identifying feature."
