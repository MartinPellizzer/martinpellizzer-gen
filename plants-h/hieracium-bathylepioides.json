    "intro": "Hieracium bathylepioides, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the dandelion family (Compositae) and is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering head composed of yellow ray florets. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped with serrated edges, and the flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn. The species is known for its ability to spread vegetatively through rhizomes, making it both a persistent weed and a valuable plant in certain ecological contexts."
