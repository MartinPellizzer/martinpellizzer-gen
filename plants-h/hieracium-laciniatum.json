    "intro": "Hieracium laciniatum, commonly known as the cut-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant features finely dissected, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its flowers are typically yellow and arranged in a flat-topped cluster, producing small seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Hieracium laciniatum thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
