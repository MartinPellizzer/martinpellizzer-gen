    "intro": "Hieracium mimeticum, commonly known as the mimic hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are yellow, with ray florets that are often shorter than the disk florets. Hieracium mimeticum is known for its ability to mimic the appearance of other hawkweed species, aiding in its survival through camouflage."
