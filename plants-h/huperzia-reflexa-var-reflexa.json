    "intro": "Huperzia reflexa var. reflexa, commonly known as the reflexed huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery, evergreen leaves that are often curled or twisted. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as rocky crevices or forest floors. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the leaves, which are dispersed by wind. This variety is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in ecological succession in temperate regions."
