    "intro": "Habranthus berteroi, commonly known as the white star orchid, is a flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its showy, star-shaped white flowers. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, often in rocky or alpine habitats. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists."
