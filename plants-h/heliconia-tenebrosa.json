    "intro": "Heliconia tenebrosa, commonly known as the dark heliconia, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, elongated bracts that form a striking, boat-shaped inflorescence. The plant produces vibrant orange-red flowers that are clustered within the bracts, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bats. Its leaves are broad and often have a waxy texture, adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments. Heliconia tenebrosa is also valued for its ornamental use in horticulture due to its unique and eye-catching appearance."
