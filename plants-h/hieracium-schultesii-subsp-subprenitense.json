It belongs to the family Asteraceae and is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, hairy leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in composite heads, typical of the daisy family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine habitats, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
