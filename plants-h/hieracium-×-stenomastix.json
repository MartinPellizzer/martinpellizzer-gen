It is characterized by its yellow flowers and rosette growth habit, often found in meadows and disturbed soils. The plant typically has hairy stems and leaves with a rough texture. It produces small, disk-like flowers that are clustered in a composite head. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is often found in regions with diverse environmental conditions."
