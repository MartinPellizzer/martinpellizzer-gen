    "intro": "Hieracium gronovii var. foliosum, commonly known as the Greenland hawkweed, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dark green, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in rocky and sandy soils, often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive species."
