    "intro": "Heterotropa hexaloba, commonly known as the six-lobed bladderwort, is a carnivorous plant native to tropical regions. It belongs to the family Lentibulariaceae and is characterized by its small, bladder-like structures used to trap prey. The plant typically grows in wet, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshy or aquatic environments. Its leaves are specialized with bladder cells that inflate to capture small aquatic organisms. The plant's flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with a distinctive spurred structure."
