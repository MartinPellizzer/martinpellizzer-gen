    "intro": "Helichrysum dichroolepis, commonly known as the two-colored everlasting flower, is a member of the Asteraceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and vibrant yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces small, daisy-like blooms that are often used in floral arrangements due to their long-lasting nature. Its leaves are typically gray-green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Helichrysum dichroolepis thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
