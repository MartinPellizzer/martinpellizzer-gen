    "intro": "Hieracium perpropinquum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its rosette of basal leaves and a flowering stem that bears yellow disk flowers surrounded by ray florets. Native to Europe, it has been introduced to other regions and is often found in disturbed soils, meadows, and along roadsides. The plant produces achenes with pappus for wind dispersal, aiding in its spread. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and weed management."
