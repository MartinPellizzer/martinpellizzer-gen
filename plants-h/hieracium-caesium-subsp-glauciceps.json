    "intro": "Hieracium caesium subsp. glauciceps, commonly known as the glaucous hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands, meadows, and rocky slopes. The plant is characterized by its upright stems and clusters of yellow flowers, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered with a fine, white pubescence, giving them a bluish-gray appearance. The species is noted for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils and its role in supporting local pollinator populations."
