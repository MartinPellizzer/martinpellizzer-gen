It is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night. The plant has a ribbed structure with areoles that bear both spines and flowers. Its flowers are typically short-lived, lasting only a few hours, and are pollinated by nocturnal insects. The species is adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water to survive."
