    "intro": "Hieracium detonsum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the sunflower family (Asteraceae). It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and fields, and is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces numerous small, wind-dispersed seeds, allowing it to spread easily in new areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
