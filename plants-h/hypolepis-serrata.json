    "intro": "Hypolepis serrata, commonly known as the serrated shield fern, is a species of fern native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive, shield-shaped fronds that are often divided into segments with serrated edges. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its rhizomes are creeping and help in the spread of the plant, while the fronds are often used in traditional medicine. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in maintaining soil stability."
