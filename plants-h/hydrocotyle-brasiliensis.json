    "intro": "Hydrocotyle brasiliensis, commonly known as Brazilian water shield, is a floating aquatic plant native to South America. It has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize the sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
