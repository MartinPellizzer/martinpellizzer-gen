    "intro": "Hydastylus subcernuus, commonly known as the water lily of the genus Hydastylus, is a tropical aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves and showy, fragrant flowers that bloom above the water surface. The plant has a rhizomatous root system that anchors it in shallow water, allowing it to thrive in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. Its leaves are typically broad and rounded, with a waxy surface that helps repel water. The flowers are usually pink or white, and they play a role in attracting pollinators such as beetles and flies."
