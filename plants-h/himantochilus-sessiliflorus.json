    "intro": "Himantochilus sessiliflorus, commonly known as the sessile-flowered sandalwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the Western Ghats of India. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored wood, which is highly valued for its use in perfumery and traditional medicine. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a smooth margin. It produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by elliptical, woody fruits. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
