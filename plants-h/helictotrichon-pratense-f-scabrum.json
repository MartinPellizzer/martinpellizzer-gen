    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense f. scabrum, commonly known as rough meadow grass, is a perennial grass species characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and inflorescence. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, thriving in temperate climates. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that often lie close to the ground, forming dense mats. Its small, spike-like flower heads contain numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. This form is distinguished by its scabrous leaf surfaces, giving it a unique appearance compared to other members of the genus."
