    "intro": "Hydrocotyle peltiformis, commonly known as the broadleaf marsh pennywort, is a flowering plant native to wetland environments in the Americas. It is characterized by its heart-shaped, floating leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered in umbels. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, making it a common species in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Hydrocotyle peltiformis plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
