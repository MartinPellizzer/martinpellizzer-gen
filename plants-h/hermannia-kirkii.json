    "intro": "Hermannia kirkii, commonly known as the African bellflower, is a flowering plant native to tropical and southern Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows as an herb or shrub, often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually opposite and elliptical, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Hermannia kirkii produces small, clustered fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
