    "intro": "Hieracium chrysanthemum, commonly known as the common hawkweed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Asteraceae family. It is characterized by its yellow or orange composite flowers, which are made up of many small florets arranged in a flat head. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, and it is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves, and it produces achenes as its seeds. Hieracium chrysanthemum is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to spread rapidly."
