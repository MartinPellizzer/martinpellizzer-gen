    "intro": "Harmala, commonly known as the devil's weed, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Harmala holotricha and Harmala pentaphylla, which are native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. These plants are characterized by their small, yellow flowers and compound leaves, often growing in arid or semi-arid environments. Harmala species contain various alkaloids, including harmine and tetrahydroharmine, which have been studied for their potential medicinal and psychoactive properties. They are often found in rocky soils and can thrive in harsh climatic conditions."
