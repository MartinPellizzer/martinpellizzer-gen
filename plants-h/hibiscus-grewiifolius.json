    "intro": "Hibiscus grewiifolius, commonly known as the Florida hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in wetlands, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, thriving in moist, acidic soils. It blooms from late spring to early fall, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hibiscus grewiifolius is a valuable component of wetland ecosystems, contributing to biodiversity and habitat structure."
