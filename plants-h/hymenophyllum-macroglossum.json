    "intro": "Hymenophyllum macroglossum, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a small, epiphytic fern native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, linear leaves that are typically 10\u201320 cm in length. The fronds are usually leathery and have a distinctive, elongated shape with a broad base. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found growing on trees or rocks. The plant's spores are released from tiny, clustered structures called sori located on the underside of its leaves."
