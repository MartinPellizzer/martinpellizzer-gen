    "intro": "Hedysarum nummulariifolium var. renifolium, commonly known as the woolly milkvetch, is a perennial legume native to the western United States. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and distinctive, rounded, woolly leaves. The plant produces small, yellow pea-like flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in sagebrush steppe and desert environments. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant for soil stabilization and ecological restoration."
