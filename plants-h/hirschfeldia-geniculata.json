    "intro": "Hirschfeldia geniculata, commonly known as the zigzag dandelion, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its distinctive zigzagging stem and yellow composite flowers that resemble dandelions. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its seed heads are spherical and release lightweight seeds with parachute-like structures. Hirschfeldia geniculata is adapted to arid environments and is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
