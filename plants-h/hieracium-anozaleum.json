It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium anozaleum is known for its ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
