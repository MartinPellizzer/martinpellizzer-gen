    "intro": "Heracleum bailletianum, commonly known as the Baillet's giant hogweed, is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its large, umbrella-like inflorescence and hollow stems. It is native to central and eastern Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed habitats such as riverbanks and meadows. The plant can grow up to 3 meters tall, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed. Its flowers are white to pale green and are followed by small, brownish fruits. Due to its potential to cause skin irritation, it is considered a noxious weed in many regions."
