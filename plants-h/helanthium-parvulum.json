    "intro": "Helanthium parvulum, commonly known as the smallflower water starwort, is a small aquatic plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and slow-moving streams. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often submerged, with small white or pale yellow flowers that appear above the water surface. Its reproductive structures are adapted for water dispersal, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small organisms. Helanthium parvulum is generally considered a minor weed in some water bodies but is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and ecological niche."
