    "intro": "Helictochloa gervaisii subsp. arundana, commonly known as the sand couch grass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and narrow, blue-green leaves that are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are typically wind-pollinated. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes or inland plains. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion in its native habitats."
