It belongs to the family Poaceae, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant features small, showy blue to violet flowers that bloom in early spring, typically from March to May.

This variety is distinguished by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Houstonia."
