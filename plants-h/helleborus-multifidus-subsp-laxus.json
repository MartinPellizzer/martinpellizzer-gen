    "intro": "Helleborus multifidus subsp. laxus, commonly known as the loose-leaved hellebore, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, palmately divided leaves that are often adorned with waxy white veins. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. It prefers shady, moist environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its toxic properties, it should be handled with care."
