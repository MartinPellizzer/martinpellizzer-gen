    "intro": "Hedwigia panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian hedwigia, is a rare and endemic moss species found primarily in the tropical regions of Panama. It belongs to the family Pottiaceae and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and dark green, crisped leaves. The plant typically grows on shaded, moist rock surfaces or soil, thriving in humid environments. Its spores are produced in small, clustered capsules that are often covered in a protective operculum. Due to its limited distribution and specialized habitat requirements, Hedwigia panamensis is considered a vulnerable species."
