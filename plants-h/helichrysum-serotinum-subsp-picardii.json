    "intro": "Helichrysum serotinum subsp. picardii, commonly known as the Picard's everlasting, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, yellow-orange flower heads that resemble small sunflowers, which remain intact even after flowering. The plant produces small, bract-like leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long-lasting flowers, which are used in dried flower arrangements."
