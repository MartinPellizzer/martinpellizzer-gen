    "intro": "Hieracium baphicum, commonly known as the Baphic Hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers and hairy, lobed leaves. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in meadows and grasslands. The plant produces achenes, which are small, dry fruits that disperse seeds through the wind. It is often considered a weed due to its aggressive growth and ability to colonize disturbed soils."
