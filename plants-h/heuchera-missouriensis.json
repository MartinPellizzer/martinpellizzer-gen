    "intro": "Heuchera missouriensis, commonly known as Missouri alumroot, is a perennial herb native to the central United States. It is characterized by its basal rosette of heart-shaped, often variegated leaves that range in color from deep maroon to silver-white. The plant produces upright spikes of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental foliage and early blooming habit contribute to its horticultural value."
