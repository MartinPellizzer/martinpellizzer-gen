    "intro": "Hakea incrassata, commonly known as the broad-leaved hakea, is a shrub native to south-western Australia. It is characterized by its dense, cylindrical inflorescences that produce showy, red or orange flowers. The plant has thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention in arid conditions. It is well adapted to fire-prone environments and can resprout from underground lignified stems after a fire. Hakea incrassata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
