It is characterized by its dense, needle-like leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, providing a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early summer. Hakea roycei is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
