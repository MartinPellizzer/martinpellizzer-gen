    "intro": "Habenaria macrantha, commonly known as the large-flowered helmet orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and showy, helmet-shaped flowers that are typically greenish-yellow with red or purple markings. The plant produces numerous small, white to pale yellow flowers along the stem, which bloom in late summer to early autumn. Its leaves are arranged in two rows, forming a tight rosette that helps conserve moisture. Habenaria macrantha is often found in forest understories and is adapted to thrive in humid, shaded environments."
