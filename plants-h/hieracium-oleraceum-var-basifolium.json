    "intro": "Hieracium oleraceum var. basifolium, commonly known as the basal-leaved hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and yellow disc flowers surrounded by ray florets. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides. It has a creeping rootstock that allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in agricultural areas. The leaves are usually lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while the flowers bloom from late spring to early autumn."
