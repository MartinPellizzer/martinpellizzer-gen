It features slender, erect stems covered in fine, silver-white hairs that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are narrow, lance-shaped, and similarly hairy, contributing to its silvery foliage. It produces small, tubular flowers clustered in spikes, typically in shades of white or pale blue. This plant is often used in ornamental gardening for its aesthetic appeal and drought tolerance."
