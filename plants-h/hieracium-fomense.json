    "intro": "[WRONG START] Hieracius fomense, commonly known as the yellow hawkweed, is a flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its bright yellow ray florets and a central disk of tubular flowers, typical of the daisy family. The plant typically grows in meadows, pastures, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it produces achenes as its seed dispersal mechanism. Hieracium fomense is an invasive species in many regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
