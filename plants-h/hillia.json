It is native to Central and South America, where it thrives in mountainous regions with cool, moist climates. The plants typically have showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Hillia species are often found in rocky soils and can grow in both shrub-like and herbaceous forms. Their botanical characteristics make them popular among horticulturists and botanists interested in alpine flora."
