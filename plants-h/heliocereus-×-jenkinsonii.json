    "intro": "Heliocereus \u00d7 jenkinsonii, commonly known as the night-blooming cereus, is a hybrid cactus species native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its spiny, columnar stems and its ability to produce large, showy flowers that open at night. The flowers are typically white or pale pink and emit a sweet fragrance to attract pollinators. This plant thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. It is also known for its slow growth rate and long lifespan, making it a popular choice for xeriscaping and desert gardens."
