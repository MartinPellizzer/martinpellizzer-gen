    "intro": "Hieracium sylvaticum subsp. oxyodontopsis, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its rosette-forming growth habit and yellow composite flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, as well as its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other Hieracium species. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native range."
