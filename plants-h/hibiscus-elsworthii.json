    "intro": "Hibiscus elsworthii, commonly known as the desert hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its large, showy, five-petaled flowers that range in color from white to deep pink. The plant has thick, waxy leaves that help it retain moisture in hot, dry environments. Its flowering period typically occurs during the summer months, and it produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Hibiscus elsworthii is well adapted to drought conditions, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping."
