It is native to Central Europe and is typically found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and meadows. The plant features yellow composite flowers with ray florets surrounding a central disc of tubular florets. Its leaves are usually basal, forming a rosette, and are covered in fine hairs. Hieracium yxnerumense is often considered a weed in agricultural areas but plays a role in supporting local pollinator populations."
