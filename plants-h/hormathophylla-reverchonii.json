It is characterized by its tall, grass-like appearance with dense clusters of spikelets along its stems. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, particularly in marshes and shallow lakes. Its rhizomes help stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Hormathophylla reverchonii plays an important role in the ecological balance of its habitat by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
