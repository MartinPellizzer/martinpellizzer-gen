It belongs to the Apiaceae family, characterized by its umbellate inflorescence and aromatic foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky, arid environments, showcasing adaptations to harsh, dry conditions. Its flowers are small and white, often clustered in umbrella-like clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
