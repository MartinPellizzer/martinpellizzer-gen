    "intro": "Hieracium amneum, commonly known as the mouse-ear hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its leaves are hairy and heart-shaped, while its flowers are yellow with a central disk. Hieracium amneum is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and competitive nature."
