    "intro": "Hypsophila, commonly known as the \"peacock flower,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. Hypsophila species are characterized by their showy, feather-like bracts that resemble the tail of a peacock, often in shades of red, orange, and yellow. They typically grow as annual or perennial herbs, and many species are cultivated for their ornamental value. The flowers are usually small and inconspicuous, with the bracts serving as the primary visual attraction."
