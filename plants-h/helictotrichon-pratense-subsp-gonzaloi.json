    "intro": "Helictotrichon pratense subsp. gonzaloi, commonly known as the Gonzalo's bluegrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of southern South America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy, and it produces small, blue to purple flowers in panicles during the spring and summer. It is well adapted to high-altitude environments and can tolerate cold temperatures and poor soil conditions. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique ecological niche and limited distribution."
