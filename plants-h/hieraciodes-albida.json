    "intro": "Hieraciodes albida, commonly known as the white mountain fleabane, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its fluffy, white composite flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Hieraciodes albida is an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
