    "intro": "Hieracium istriacum, commonly known as the Istrian hawkweed, is a flowering plant native to Europe, particularly found in the Istrian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Asteraceae, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are basal, rough, and hairy, while the flowers are yellow with a central disc. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
