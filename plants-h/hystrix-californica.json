    "intro": "Hystrix californica, commonly known as the California hedgehog cactus, is a species of cactus native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny stems that form a rounded, hedgehog-like appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, adding a striking contrast to its spiky structure. Its leaves are modified into spines, which help reduce water loss and deter herbivores. Hystrix californica is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
