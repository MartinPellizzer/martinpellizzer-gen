    "intro": "Holcoglossum tsii, commonly known as the Yunnan ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, elongated flower spikes that bear showy, pale green to white flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded forest environments. Its botanical features include lanceolate leaves and a distinctive inflorescence that sets it apart from other orchid species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
