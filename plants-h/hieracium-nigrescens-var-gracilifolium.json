    "intro": "Hieracium nigrescens var. gracilifolium, commonly known as the slender-leaved hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces yellow composite flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are usually slender and linear, with a hairy surface, and the flowers are arranged in a single terminal head. This variety is distinguished by its delicate foliage and is often found in temperate regions with moderate climates."
