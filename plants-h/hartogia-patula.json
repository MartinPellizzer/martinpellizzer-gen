    "intro": "Hartogia patula, commonly known as the Hartog's ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the Western Cape of South Africa. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and small, pale green or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees or rocks without deriving nutrients from them. Hartogia patula is highly specialized, requiring specific environmental conditions to thrive, which makes it extremely sensitive to habitat disturbance. Due to its rarity and habitat specificity, it is considered a critically endangered species."
