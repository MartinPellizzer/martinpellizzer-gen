It is characterized by its elongated, fleshy thalli that can grow up to several meters in length. The plant features long, slender spines along its surface, which provide structural support and may deter herbivores. It typically thrives in shallow, coastal waters with moderate currents. Holothrix longicornu plays a role in providing habitat for small marine organisms and contributes to the ecological balance of its environment."
