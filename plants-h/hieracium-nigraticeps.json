It is characterized by its dark purple to black flower heads, which are surrounded by narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides and meadows. It has a taproot system and produces numerous small, yellowish flowers that develop into seeds. Hieracium nigraticeps is an invasive species in some regions, often outcompeting native vegetation."
