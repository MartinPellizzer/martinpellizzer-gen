    "intro": "Huperzia reflexointegra, commonly known as the rock huperzia, is a species of fern that belongs to the family Huperziaceae. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen fronds that are often curled or rolled when young. The plant typically grows in rocky or shaded environments, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its sporophytes produce spores on the underside of the fronds, which are dispersed by wind. Huperzia reflexointegra is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in shaded areas."
