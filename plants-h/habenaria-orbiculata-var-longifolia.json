    "intro": "Habenaria orbiculata var. longifolia, commonly known as the long-leaved marsh orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to wetland habitats in eastern Australia. It features erect, grass-like stems with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces dense clusters of pale yellow to greenish-white flowers, which are typically borne on long, slender pedicels. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb nutrients from waterlogged soils. This orchid is noted for its ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments, making it a characteristic component of swamp and creek margins."
