    "intro": "Hymenaea courbaril var. altissima, commonly known as the Brazil wood, is a deciduous tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark and large, palmate leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The tree produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, oval seeds. Its wood is highly valued for its rich red color and durability, though it is now protected due to overharvesting. The plant plays an important ecological role in its native habitats, providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
