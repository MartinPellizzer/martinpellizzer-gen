It produces striking violet or white flowers in the fall, which are clustered in dense, fragrant spikes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped blossoms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking late-season color. The autumn crocus is also valued for its ornamental beauty and historical use in perfumery."
