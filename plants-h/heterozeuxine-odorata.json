    "intro": "Heterozeuxine odorata, commonly known as the sweet-scented fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, arching fronds that emit a subtle, pleasant fragrance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are positioned on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Heterozeuxine odorata is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
