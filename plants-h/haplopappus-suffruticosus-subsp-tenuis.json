    "intro": "Haplopappus suffruticosus subsp. tenuis, commonly known as the slender haplopappus, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and foliage with silvery or grayish-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, typical of the genus Haplopappus. Its leaves are typically narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in dry environments. This subspecies is often found in rocky soils and is well-suited to harsh, sun-exposed conditions."
