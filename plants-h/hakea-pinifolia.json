    "intro": "Hakea pinifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its needle-like leaves, which are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces bright red or orange cylindrical flower spikes that bloom in spring. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant. Hakea pinifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native gardens."
