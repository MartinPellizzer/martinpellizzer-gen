It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that consist of both ray and disk flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations, where it thrives in cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are basal, lance-shaped, and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are upright and branched. Hieracium araeopum plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is an indicator species for alpine ecosystems."
