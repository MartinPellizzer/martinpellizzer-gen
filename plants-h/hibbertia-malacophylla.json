    "intro": "Hibbertia malacophylla, commonly known as the silverleaf hibbertia, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its silver-gray foliage, which is covered in fine, soft hairs that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. The plant produces clusters of bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in spring. It is a shrub that grows to a height of about 30\u201360 centimeters and is well adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Hibbertia malacophylla is often found in heathlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance."
