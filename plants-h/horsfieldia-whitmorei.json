It belongs to the family Orchidaceae and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surface of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are specialized for absorbing moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Horsfieldia whitmorei is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its native habitat."
