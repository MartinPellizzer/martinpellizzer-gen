    "intro": "Heliophytum sidifolium, commonly known as the rock spurge, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, spiny stems and leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its rugged foliage. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its hardy nature, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in arid and semi-arid regions."
