    "intro": "Hylaeaicum tarapotoense, commonly known as the Peruvian orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to the cloud forests of northern Peru. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically display a mix of white, green, and purple hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the cool, misty conditions of its high-altitude habitat. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in the nutrient-poor soils of its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat vulnerability, it is considered a conservation concern."
