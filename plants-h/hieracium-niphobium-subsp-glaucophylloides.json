    "intro": "Hieracium niphobium subsp. glaucophylloides, commonly known as the alpine hawkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its rosette-forming basal leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of white to pale green hairs. The plant produces small yellow flowers arranged in a composite head, typical of the Asteraceae family. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
