    "intro": "Hirpicium antunesii, commonly known as the Antunes' velvet tunicate, is a unique marine invertebrate belonging to the class Tunicata. It is characterized by its soft, gelatinous body covered in a thin, transparent tunic. This species is typically found in shallow coastal waters, where it attaches itself to rocks or other substrates. Hirpicium antunesii plays a role in marine ecosystems by contributing to nutrient cycling and providing habitat for smaller organisms. Due to its specialized habitat and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species."
