    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. comosa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in early summer, which are typically clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are elliptical, serrated, and covered in a fine, white down. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
