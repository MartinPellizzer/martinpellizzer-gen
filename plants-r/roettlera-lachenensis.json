    "intro": "Roettlera lachenensis, commonly known as the Lachen's roettlera, is a rare flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Eastern Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on rocky slopes or in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical with a smooth surface and a slight pubescence, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roettlera lachenensis is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
