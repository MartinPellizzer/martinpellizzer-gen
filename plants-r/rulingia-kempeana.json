    "intro": "Rulingia kempeana, commonly known as the golden wax tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to the western Pacific islands. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The tree produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by orange-red fruits containing seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
