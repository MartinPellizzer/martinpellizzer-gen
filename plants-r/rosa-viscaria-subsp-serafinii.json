    "intro": "Rosa viscaria subsp. serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini's rose, is a rare and beautiful shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
