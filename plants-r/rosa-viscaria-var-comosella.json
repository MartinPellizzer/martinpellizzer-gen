    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. comosella, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and stems covered in a thick layer of white to grey pubescence. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in colder climates."
