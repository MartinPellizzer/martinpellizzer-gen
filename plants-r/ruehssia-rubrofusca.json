    "intro": "Ruehssia rubrofusca, commonly known as the red-fleshed euphorbia, is a striking succulent native to southern Africa. It features a short, woody stem with thick, fleshy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers in clusters, which appear during the warmer months. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Due to its toxic sap, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
