    "intro": "Rhinanthus drummond-hayi, commonly known as Drummond's blazing star, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic species, and it is a hemiparasitic plant that derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants. The plant produces showy, orange to red flowers in late summer, typically from July to September. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as prairies, meadows, and woodland edges. Its ecological importance lies in its role as a nectar source for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
