    "intro": "Rhynchosia hockii, commonly known as the African flame bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, orange-red flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces elongated pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Rhynchosia hockii is adapted to grow in dry, sandy soils and is drought-tolerant. Its rapid growth makes it useful for soil stabilization and as a forage plant in arid regions."
