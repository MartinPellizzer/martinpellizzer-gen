It is a terrestrial orchid with slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale pink, with a distinctive three-lobed lip. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique microclimate of its habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
