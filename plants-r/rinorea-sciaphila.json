    "intro": "Rinorea sciaphila, commonly known as the shade-loving rinorea, is a tropical plant native to the understory of humid forests in South America. It is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically during the wet season. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
