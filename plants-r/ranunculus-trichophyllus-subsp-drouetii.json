It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically blooming in spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. It prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
