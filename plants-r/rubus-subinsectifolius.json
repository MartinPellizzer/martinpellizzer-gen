    "intro": "Rubus subinsectifolius, commonly known as the insect-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they may vary in taste depending on the region. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique leaf structure, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
