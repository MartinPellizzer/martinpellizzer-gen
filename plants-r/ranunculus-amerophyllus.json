    "intro": "Ranunculus amerophyllus, commonly known as the American water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soil along streams, ponds, and lake margins. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are often floating or submerged, and it produces showy, yellow or white flowers with five petals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms. Ranunculus amerophyllus is also valued for its ornamental appeal in water gardens."
