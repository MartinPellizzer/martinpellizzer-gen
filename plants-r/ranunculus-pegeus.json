    "intro": "Ranunculus pegeus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to alpine regions of Europe and Asia. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or grassy habitats at high elevations. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, greenish fruits that contain seeds. Ranunculus pegeus is adapted to cold climates and is often found in mountainous areas where it thrives in well-drained soils."
