    "intro": "Rhododendron ambiguum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Nepal, Bhutan, and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, well-drained soils. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are dark green and glossy, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. Rhododendron ambiguum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty. However, it is important to note that some species in the genus can be toxic, so care should be taken when handling or consuming any part of the plant."
