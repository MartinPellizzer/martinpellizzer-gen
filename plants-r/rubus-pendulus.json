    "intro": "Rubus pendulus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, while the stems are covered in fine hairs. Rubus pendulus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
