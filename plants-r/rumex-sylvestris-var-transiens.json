    "intro": "Rumex sylvestris var. transiens, commonly known as the wandering sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the veins, which become more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spikes during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
