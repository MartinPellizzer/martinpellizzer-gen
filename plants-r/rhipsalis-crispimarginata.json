    "intro": "Rhipsalis crispimarginata, commonly known as the silver needle cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It features long, thin, and flexible stems that are covered in white, woolly hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that are often fragrant and bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its unique appearance and ease of care, it is a popular choice for indoor gardening."
