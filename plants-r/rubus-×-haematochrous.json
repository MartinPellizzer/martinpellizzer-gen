    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 haematochrous, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry. It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its dark red to black fruits that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of its parent species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. The fruit's unique coloration is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, which also contribute to its antioxidant properties."
