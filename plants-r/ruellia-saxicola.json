    "intro": "Ruellia saxicola, commonly known as the rock ruellia, is a perennial shrub native to the southern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically blue to purple in color, arranged in clusters at the ends of the branches. Ruellia saxicola thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
