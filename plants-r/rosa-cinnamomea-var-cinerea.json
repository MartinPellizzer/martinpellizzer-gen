    "intro": "Rosa cinnamomea var. cinerea, commonly known as the silver rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its pale silver-gray foliage, which gives it its common name, and its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit and is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, and it is relatively hardy in temperate climates. The leaves are simple, ovate, and covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects light and adds to its visual appeal."
