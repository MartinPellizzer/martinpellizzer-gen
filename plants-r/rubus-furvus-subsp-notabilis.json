    "intro": "Rubus furvus subsp. notabilis, commonly known as the red-berried blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that turn red when mature. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its distinctive berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and for local foraging."
