    "intro": "Rubus slavikii, commonly known as Slavik's raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the edible berries. Its leaves are palmate with serrated edges and have a slightly hairy texture. Rubus slavikii thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and rocky habitats."
