    "intro": "Rubus frondicomus, commonly known as the broad-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the forests of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its stems are thorny, typical of the Rubus genus, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for birds and insects."
