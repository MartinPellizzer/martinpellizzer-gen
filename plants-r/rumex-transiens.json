    "intro": "Rumex transiens, commonly known as the transient sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, making them potentially toxic if consumed in large quantities."
