    "intro": "Rubus laevis, commonly known as the smooth blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the summer. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five oval leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. The fruit is edible and has a sweet, tart flavor, making it a popular wild plant for foraging."
