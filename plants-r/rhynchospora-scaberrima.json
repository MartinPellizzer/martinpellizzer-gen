    "intro": "Rhynchospora scaberrima, commonly known as the roughside spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense clusters of small, spike-like flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and rough to the touch, contributing to its common name. Rhynchospora scaberrima thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swamps, marshes, and along the edges of ponds."
