    "intro": "Ranunculus heikkinenii, commonly known as the Heikkinen's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, usually yellow or white petals and often hairy foliage. The plant typically grows in alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually solitary, with five to eight petal-like sepals that are often mistaken for true petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus heikkinenii is considered a species of conservation concern."
