It is characterized by its distinctive blue-gray foliage and prominent purple or brown markings on its leaves. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Rytidosperma maculatum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in ecological restoration projects."
