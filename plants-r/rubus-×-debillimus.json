    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 debillimus, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are often thorny. This hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is cultivated for both commercial and ornamental purposes."
