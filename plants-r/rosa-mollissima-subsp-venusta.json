    "intro": "Rosa mollissima subsp. venusta, commonly known as the Mexican beauty rose, is a species native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its soft, velvety foliage and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a cut flower."
