    "intro": "Ricinocarpus persimilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in sandy or saline soils near the shoreline. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are usually pink or red in color. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ricinocarpus persimilis is adapted to salt spray and can thrive in harsh coastal environments."
