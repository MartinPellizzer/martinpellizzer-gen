    "intro": "Rosa mollissima var. glabrata, commonly known as the smooth rose, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, velvety foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in pink or white. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for arid and semi-arid climates. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. The variety glabrata is distinguished by its smooth, hairless leaves, which set it apart from other varieties of Rosa mollissima."
