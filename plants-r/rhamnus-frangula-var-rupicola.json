    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula var. rupicola, commonly known as the rock-frangula, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are a source of food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects in arid or disturbed landscapes."
