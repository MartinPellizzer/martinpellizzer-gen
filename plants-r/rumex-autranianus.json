    "intro": "Rumex autranianus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It features erect, slender stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height, often with reddish veins. The leaves are lance-shaped, with a waxy surface and a prominent midrib, and they are usually alternate along the stem. It produces small, clustered flowers in greenish-white clusters, which are followed by three-winged, triangular fruits. This plant thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands and along riverbanks."
