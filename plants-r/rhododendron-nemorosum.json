    "intro": "Rhododendron nemorosum, commonly known as the wood rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountain forests of Europe. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features broad, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often accompanied by a strong, spicy fragrance. Rhododendron nemorosum thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded woodland environments."
