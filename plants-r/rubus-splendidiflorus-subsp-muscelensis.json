It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its range."
