    "intro": "Rumex atlanticus, commonly known as coastal sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern coast of North America. It thrives in moist, sandy soils along shorelines and tidal flats, often in brackish or saltwater environments. The plant features upright, hairy stems and alternate, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. Its small, greenish-white flowers are clustered in terminal spikes, and it produces edible, sour-tasting leaves that have been used historically for food and medicine. Rumex atlanticus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
