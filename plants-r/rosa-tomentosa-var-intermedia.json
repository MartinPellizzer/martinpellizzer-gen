It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which provides insulation against cold climates. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. Its foliage remains evergreen in mild winters, making it a resilient choice for garden landscapes."
