It is a shrub or small tree that can grow up to 5 meters tall, characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers. The plant produces yellowish-orange berries that contain the seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Rauvolfia welwitschii is notable for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids like reserpine."
