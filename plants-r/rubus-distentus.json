    "intro": "Rubus distentus, commonly known as the broad-leafed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and large, lobed leaves that are often hairy beneath. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These fruits are edible and have a tart, juicy flavor. Rubus distentus thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
