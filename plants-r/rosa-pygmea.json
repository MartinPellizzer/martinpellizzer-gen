    "intro": "Rosa pygmea, commonly known as the dwarf garden rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States and is characterized by its compact growth habit and vibrant, fragrant blooms. The plant typically grows to a height of only 1 to 2 feet, making it ideal for small garden spaces or container planting. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa pygmea produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding both color and fragrance to the garden."
