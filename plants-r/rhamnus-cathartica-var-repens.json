    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. repens, commonly known as creeping buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, oval leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter underneath. Its flowers are clustered in small racemes and are followed by dark blue, fleshy berries. The species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
