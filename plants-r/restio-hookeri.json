    "intro": "Restio hookeri, commonly known as the Hooker's restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to South Africa. It is a perennial, herbaceous plant characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance and wiry, often spiky stems. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences bearing tiny, white or pale blue flowers, which are typically wind-pollinated. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a slightly hairy texture, adapting to the arid conditions of its habitat. Restio hookeri is often found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in coastal and mountainous regions."
