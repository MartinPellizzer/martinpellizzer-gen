    "intro": "Rubus spinetorum, commonly known as the spiny blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark red or black color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its prickly growth habit, it can be challenging to manage in agricultural or garden settings."
