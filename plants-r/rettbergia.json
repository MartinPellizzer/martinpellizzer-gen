    "intro": "Rettbergia, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a member of the Polypodiaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that display a striking golden hue at the tips. Native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia, this fern thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant's rhizome system allows it to spread slowly and form dense ground covers. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and indoor plant collections."
