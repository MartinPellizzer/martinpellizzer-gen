    "intro": "Rumex pseudoscutatus, commonly known as the narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, wetlands, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, erect spikes, and it produces elongated, segmented fruits known as achenes. Rumex pseudoscutatus is often found in disturbed or nutrient-rich soils and is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
