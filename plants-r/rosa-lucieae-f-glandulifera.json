    "intro": "Rosa lucieae f. glandulifera, commonly known as the glandular-stem Rosa, is a botanical variant of the species Rosa lucieae. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the stems, which are small, raised bumps that secrete substances. This feature is a key identifier in distinguishing it from other Rosa species. The plant typically produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is native to specific regions in Central Asia and is often found in dry, rocky habitats."
