It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant is native to the Caucasus region and is valued for its ornamental qualities and hardiness. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its compact growth habit and winter-hardiness make it a popular choice in colder climates."
