    "intro": "Ranunculus trifolius, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a creeping rhizome and produces bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning they are divided into three leaflets, which are often heart-shaped. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. The flowers bloom early in the spring, making it one of the first wildflowers to appear in temperate regions."
