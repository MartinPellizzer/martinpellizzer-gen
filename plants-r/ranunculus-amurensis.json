    "intro": "Ranunculus amurensis, commonly known as the Amur buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to eastern Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or yellow sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus amurensis is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
