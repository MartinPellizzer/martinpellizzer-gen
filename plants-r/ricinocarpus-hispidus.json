    "intro": "Ricinocarpus hispidus, commonly known as the hairy ricin tree, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is a deciduous tree that can grow up to 20 meters tall, characterized by its rough, hairy bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by woody capsules containing toxic seeds. Its botanical significance lies in the presence of ricin, a potent toxin found in its seeds, which has been studied for its biochemical properties. The species is also valued for its hard, durable wood in traditional uses."
