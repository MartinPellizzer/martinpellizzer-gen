    "intro": "Rosa reuteri, commonly known as the dwarf Rosa reuteri or the Reuter's rose, is a species of shrub native to the Canary Islands. It is a compact, evergreen plant with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of white, pink, and red, usually in spring. Rosa reuteri is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to many garden settings."
