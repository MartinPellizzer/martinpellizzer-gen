    "intro": "Rhododendron herzogii, commonly known as the Herzog's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal and India. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, broad leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant prefers cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous forested areas. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after plant in horticulture, though it requires specific growing conditions to thrive. The flowers are typically pink to red in color, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat."
