    "intro": "Rinorea breteleri, commonly known as the Malagasy sandalwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
