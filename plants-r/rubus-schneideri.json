It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in the fall. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
