    "intro": "Ranunculus savatieri, commonly known as the Persian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to regions of Central Asia and the Middle East. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark veins, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its delicate appearance and long blooming period."
