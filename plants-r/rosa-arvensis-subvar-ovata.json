    "intro": "Rosa arvensis subvar. ovata, commonly known as the ovate field rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and oval-shaped leaves, which are typically serrated along the edges. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows due to its hardy nature."
