    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The leaves are typically pinnate, with five to seven leaflets that are glandular-dotted, giving the plant its specific epithet. The flowers appear in late spring to early summer and are followed by red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields."
