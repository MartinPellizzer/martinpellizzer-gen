    "intro": "Rosa platyacantha var. cuneifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaf shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features narrow, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color, with a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, usually in clusters along the stems. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardiness and ornamental value. Its botanical characteristics make it a unique addition to both garden and horticultural collections."
