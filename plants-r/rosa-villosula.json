    "intro": "Rosa villosula, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia, where it typically grows in woodland and scrubland habitats. The plant is characterized by its fuzzy, hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals, and it produces rose hips as fruit. Rosa villosula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery."
