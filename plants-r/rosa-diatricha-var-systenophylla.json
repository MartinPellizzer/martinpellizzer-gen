    "intro": "Rosa diatricha var. systenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in horticulture."
