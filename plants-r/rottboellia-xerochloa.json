    "intro": "Rottboellia xerochloa, commonly known as the desert grass or sand grass, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep root systems and reduced leaf surface area to minimize water loss. Rottboellia xerochloa is often found in sandy or rocky soils and is considered a pioneer species in disturbed or degraded habitats."
