    "intro": "Rheum compactum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, robust stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of greenish-yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, round berries. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but often used in ornamental gardening due to their striking appearance. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking both aesthetic and functional plant life."
