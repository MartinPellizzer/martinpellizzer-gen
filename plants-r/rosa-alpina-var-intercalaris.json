    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. intercalaris, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its upright growth and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, oval-shaped, and covered in a fine layer of white\u7ed2\u6bdb, which helps to reduce water loss in high-altitude environments. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
