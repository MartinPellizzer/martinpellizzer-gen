    "intro": "Rubus incarnatus var. albiflorus, commonly known as the whiteflower blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, which are distinct from the typical pink or red blooms of other Rubus species. The berries, when mature, turn a deep red and are edible, though they are often less flavorful than those of other Rubus varieties. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
