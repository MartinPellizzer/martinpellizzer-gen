    "intro": "Rubus hypargyrus var. niveus, commonly known as the white-flowered raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are white, contrasting with the typical red of other raspberry varieties, and they bloom in early summer. The fruit, which is a small, aggregate berry, is generally less flavorful than the common red raspberry. This plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit."
