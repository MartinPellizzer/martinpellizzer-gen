    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. paludum, commonly known as the bog buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in northern Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The leaves are palmately lobed and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its moist environment. It thrives in peat bogs and marshes, where it forms dense colonies. This subspecies is notable for its ecological importance in supporting diverse invertebrate life."
