    "intro": "Regelia inops, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the cloud forests of Central and South America. It is a terrestrial orchid that grows in shaded, humid environments, often on tree trunks or among leaf litter. The plant has long, slender stems and produces small, pale green or white flowers that are unique in appearance. Its botanical features include a complex root system and specialized structures for absorbing nutrients from the environment. Due to its habitat specificity and limited distribution, Regelia inops is considered endangered and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
