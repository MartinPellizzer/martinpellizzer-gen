    "intro": "Rorippa pyrenaica proles microcarpa, commonly known as the Pyrenean water-cress, is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as streams, ponds, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that bear small, alternate leaves which are usually submerged or floating. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with four petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Brassicaceae family. The seeds are tiny and enclosed in a capsule, dispersing easily by water currents."
