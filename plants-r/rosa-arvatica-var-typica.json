    "intro": "Rosa arvatica var. typica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems that support its clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant produces oval, leathery leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Rosa arvatica var. typica is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
