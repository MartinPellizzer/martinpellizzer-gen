    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 jactuosiformis, commonly known as the invasive trailing blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. This plant is native to the eastern United States but has spread to other regions, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its botanical features include compound leaves with serrated margins and flowers that are white or pale pink. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a significant weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
