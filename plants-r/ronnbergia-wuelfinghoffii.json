    "intro": "Ronnbergia wuelfinghoffii, commonly known as the W\u00fcelfinghoff's orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers with a distinctive coloration. The plant typically features broad, strap-like leaves and has a pseudobulb structure typical of many orchid species. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and requires well-draining soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated by enthusiasts but remains relatively rare in the horticultural trade."
