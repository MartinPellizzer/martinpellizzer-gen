    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. lasiocarpa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a leathery texture, while its thorns are short and curved. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and seasonal blooms."
