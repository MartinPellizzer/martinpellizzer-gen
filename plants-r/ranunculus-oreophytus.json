    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophytus, commonly known as the mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in meadows and forest margins at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
