    "intro": "Rheum wittrockii, commonly known as the giant rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often hairy leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, reddish stems with clusters of yellow flowers in the spring. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but typically not consumed due to their toughness and strong flavor. Rheum wittrockii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
