    "intro": "Rottlera ricinoides, commonly known as the African star apple, is a tropical plant native to Africa and parts of Asia. It is a small to medium-sized tree that can grow up to 10 meters tall, characterized by its smooth, grayish bark and opposite, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by fruits that resemble small apples, turning from green to yellow or red when mature. The fruit contains a single large seed surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp, which is often consumed fresh or used in culinary applications."
