    "intro": "Rosa myriacantha var. rosea, commonly known as the pink thorned rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to rose-colored flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant in temperate climates. The variety 'rosea' is distinguished by its more intensely colored flowers compared to the typical form of Rosa myriacantha."
