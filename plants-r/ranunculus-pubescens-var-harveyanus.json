    "intro": "Ranunculus pubescens var. harveyanus, commonly known as Harvey's hairy buttercup, is a variant of the hairy buttercup native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with a hairy stem and leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is usually divided into three to five leaflets, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
