    "intro": "Rhus \u00d7 hybrida, commonly known as the sumac hybrid, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is a cross between Rhus typhina (staghorn sumac) and Rhus aromatica (fragrant sumac), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The species is notable for its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and often have a distinctive red or orange coloration in the fall. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a food source for various birds and small mammals. Rhus \u00d7 hybrida is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
