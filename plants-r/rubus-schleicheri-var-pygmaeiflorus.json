    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. pygmaeiflorus, commonly known as the dwarf-flowered blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in clusters. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, often found in humid, forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
