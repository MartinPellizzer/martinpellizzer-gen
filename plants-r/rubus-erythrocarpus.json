    "intro": "Rubus erythrocarpus, commonly known as the red-fruited blackberry, is a species of brambles native to southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, though they may change color depending on the variety. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are usually serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
