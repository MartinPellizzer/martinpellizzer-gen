    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. exacutus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic, with serrated margins and a pointed apex, giving it its \"sharp-leaved\" designation. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This variant is distinguished from other Rubus species by its specific leaf shape and fruit coloration."
