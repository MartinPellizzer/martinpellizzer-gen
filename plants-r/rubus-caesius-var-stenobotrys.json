    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. stenobotrys, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, dark green leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit characteristics."
