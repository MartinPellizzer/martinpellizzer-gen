    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. microcarpus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple underneath. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Due to its aggressive growth, it can become a weed in agricultural settings."
