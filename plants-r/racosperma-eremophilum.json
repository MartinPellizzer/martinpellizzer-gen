    "intro": "Racosperma eremophilum, commonly known as the spinifex wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid regions, characterized by its dense, spiny foliage. The plant produces yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in cylindrical inflorescences. Its leaves are small, linear, and often covered in fine hairs, adapted to reduce water loss in harsh environments. Racosperma eremophilum is part of the legume family and has the ability to fix nitrogen, contributing to soil fertility in its native habitat."
