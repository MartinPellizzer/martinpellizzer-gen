    "intro": "Rhipsalis pterocaulis, commonly known as the woolly rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, trailing stems that are covered in soft, white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
