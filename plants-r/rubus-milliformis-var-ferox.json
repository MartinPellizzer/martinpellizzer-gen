    "intro": "Rubus milliformis var. ferox, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the stems are covered in stiff, barbed bracts. This variant is often cultivated for its flavorful berries, though its aggressive growth can make it a challenging weed in agricultural settings."
