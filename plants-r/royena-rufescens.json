    "intro": "Royena rufescens, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock fig, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems that turn reddish-brown with age, and its small, opposite leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental features, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in suitable climates."
