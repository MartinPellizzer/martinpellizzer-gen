    "intro": "Rubus psilocarpus, commonly known as the hallucinogenic blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that contain psychoactive compounds, primarily psilocybin and psilocin. These compounds are similar to those found in magic mushrooms and can induce hallucinogenic effects when consumed. Due to its psychoactive properties, it is considered a controlled substance in many countries."
