    "intro": "Rhus elegans, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus elegans thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. It is also valued for its ornamental qualities and ability to stabilize soil in disturbed areas."
