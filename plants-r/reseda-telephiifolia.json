    "intro": "Reseda telephiifolia, commonly known as the silverweed, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It features silver-gray foliage due to dense covering of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is fibrous and helps stabilize soil, making it useful for erosion control. Reseda telephiifolia is often found in rocky soils and open habitats, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
