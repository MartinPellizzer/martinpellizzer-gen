    "intro": "Ranunculus bonatianus, commonly known as the Bonati's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features showy, cup-shaped flowers with yellow stamens and a greenish center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate and often covered in a waxy coating. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable addition to rock gardens or alpine landscapes. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting pollinators."
