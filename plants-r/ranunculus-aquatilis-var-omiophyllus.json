    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. omiophyllus, commonly known as the water buttercup variant, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant features small, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are usually submerged or floating. It has a rhizomatous root system that helps it anchor in muddy substrates. This variant is often found in still or slow-moving water bodies, contributing to the aquatic ecosystem's biodiversity."
