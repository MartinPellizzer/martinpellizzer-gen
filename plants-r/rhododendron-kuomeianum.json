    "intro": "Rhododendron kuomeianum, commonly known as the Kuomintang rhododendron, is a species native to China, specifically found in the mountainous regions of Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining biodiversity in its native habitat."
