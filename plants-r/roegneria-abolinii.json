    "intro": "Roegneria abolinii, commonly known as the Siberian grass, is a perennial grass species native to the cold climates of Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. Roegneria abolinii is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. It is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its resilience and ability to stabilize soil in degraded areas."
