    "intro": "Rosa obtusiuscula, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rock rose, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it thrives in arid and rocky environments. The plant is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink and yellow. Its leaves are narrow and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Rosa obtusiuscula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
