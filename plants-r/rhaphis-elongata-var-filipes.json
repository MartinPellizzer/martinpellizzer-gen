It features slender, elongated leaves that are often used in horticulture for their ornamental value. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into elongated, cylindrical fruits. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and requires well-drained soil. Due to its climbing habit, it is often trained to grow on trellises or other supports."
