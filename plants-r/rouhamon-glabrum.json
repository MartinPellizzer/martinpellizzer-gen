    "intro": "Rouhamon glabrum, commonly known as the smooth rouhamon, is a perennial herb native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, almost imperceptible layer of hair. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to store water, allowing it to survive in drought conditions. Rouhamon glabrum is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its resilience and ornamental appeal."
