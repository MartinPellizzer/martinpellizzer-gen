    "intro": "Rhododendron dalhousieae var. victorianum, commonly known as the Victorian Rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of northern India. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range from pale pink to deep red, appear in early spring and are highly fragrant. This variety is well-suited to acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and landscape designs in temperate climates."
