    "intro": "Rosa ecae var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent rose, is a variety of the Rosa ecae species, characterized by its hairy or pubescent stems and leaves. It is native to certain regions of Central Asia and is typically found in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a subtle scent. Its foliage is usually dark green and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
