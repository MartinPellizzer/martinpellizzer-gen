    "intro": "Rhododendron discolor f. carneum, commonly known as the pink-flowered rhododendron, is a unique variant of the discolor species. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-pink flowers, which contrast with the typical white or pale pink of the parent species. The plant is a deciduous shrub, typically growing to a height of 1\u20133 meters, with elliptical, dark green leaves. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unusual coloration and compact growth habit."
