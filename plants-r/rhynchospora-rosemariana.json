    "intro": "Rhynchospora rosemariana, commonly known as the rosemary marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are usually dark green and slightly hairy, and it produces small, pale pink to white flowers arranged in dense clusters. Rhynchospora rosemariana is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread and form dense stands in its wetland habitat. It plays an important ecological role by providing food and habitat for various wetland organisms."
