    "intro": "Rhododendron chunii, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense foliage of dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
