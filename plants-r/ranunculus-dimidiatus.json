It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive pattern of lobes that contribute to its ornamental value. Ranunculus dimidiatus is known for its short flowering period in spring and is often found in calcareous soils."
