    "intro": "Rosa austriaca f. haplodonta, commonly known as the Austrian rose, is a unique horticultural form of the Austrian rose species. It is characterized by its smaller, more compact growth compared to the typical Rosa austriaca. The plant produces pink to white flowers that are often more delicate and numerous than those of the standard species. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty. This form is typically propagated through grafting or cuttings due to its limited natural seed production."
