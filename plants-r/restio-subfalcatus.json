It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, erect stems. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale blue flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation. Restio subfalcatus is adapted to dry conditions and plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
