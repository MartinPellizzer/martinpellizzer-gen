It features woody stems and dense, thorny growth, typical of many rose species. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
