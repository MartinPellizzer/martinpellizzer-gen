This shrub-like plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically pink to red in color, with five to seven petals. It has dark green, oval-shaped leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and requires a humid, temperate climate. Due to habitat loss, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
