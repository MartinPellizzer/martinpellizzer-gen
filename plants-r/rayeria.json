    "intro": "Rayeria, commonly known as the false lily of the valley, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Primulaceae. These plants are typically herbaceous perennials with showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including parts of Europe and Asia. Rayeria species often have opposite, ovate leaves and produce small, clustered flowers in shades of white, pink, or purple. The genus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
