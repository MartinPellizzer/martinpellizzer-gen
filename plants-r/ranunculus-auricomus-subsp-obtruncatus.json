    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. obtruncatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It features basal leaves that are palmately divided with serrated edges, and its flowers are bright yellow with five petal-like sepals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils at high altitudes. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in many areas."
