    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. adenophylla, commonly known as the\u817a\u53f6 Rosa, is a variant of the multiflora rose, native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically ovate with a distinctive glandular undersurface, giving it its botanical name. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a natural barrier due to its vigorous growth. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, though it can tolerate partial shade."
