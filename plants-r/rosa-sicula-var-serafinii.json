    "intro": "Rosa sicula var. serafinii, commonly known as the Serafini Sicilian rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a specimen plant. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens."
