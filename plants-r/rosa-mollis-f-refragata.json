    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. refragata, commonly known as the fragrant evergreen rose, is a hybrid rose species characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and its ability to retain leaves throughout the winter. It produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late winter or early spring. This plant is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salt spray and mild winters. The leaves are leathery and glossy, providing year-round visual interest. It is often used in hedges or as a foundation plant in landscaping due to its compact growth habit."
