It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are the reproductive structures typical of grasses. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage crop."
