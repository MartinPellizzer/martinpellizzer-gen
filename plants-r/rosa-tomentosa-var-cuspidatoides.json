    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. cuspidatoides, commonly known as the woolly rose or the fuzzy pink rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a woody stem with thorny branches, typical of many rose species, and its leaves are oval with serrated edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for gardens in temperate climates. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and resilience."
