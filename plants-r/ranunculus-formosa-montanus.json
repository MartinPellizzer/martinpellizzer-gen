    "intro": "Ranunculus formosa-montanus, commonly known as the Sierra buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its bright yellow or orange flowers, which typically have five to eight petals and are surrounded by a series of small, lobed sepals. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks, often in higher elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. Ranunculus formosa-montanus is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy blooms and often toxic sap."
