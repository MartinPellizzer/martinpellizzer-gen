    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. africanus, commonly known as the African castor oil plant, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it hazardous if ingested. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. Despite its dangers, it is sometimes used in traditional medicine and as an ornamental plant."
