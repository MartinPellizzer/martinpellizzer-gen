    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. aculeatus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberries, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically palmately arranged. The plant produces small, white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries in the summer. These berries are aggregate fruits formed from multiple small drupelets. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground and full sun to partial shade."
