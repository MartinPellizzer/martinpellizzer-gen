    "intro": "Rubus magnisepalus, commonly known as the large-sepaled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
