    "intro": "Rosa abietina f. clivorum, commonly known as the Alpine rose or cliff rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It features simple, lance-shaped leaves that are densely arranged along its stems. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
