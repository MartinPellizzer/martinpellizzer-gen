    "intro": "Rhododendron sichotense, commonly known as the Sichoteng or Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high elevations, often in rocky or alpine habitats. The plant is characterized by its clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its harsh environment. Rhododendron sichotense is valued for its ornamental qualities and plays a role in the ecological systems of its native regions."
