    "intro": "Rubus rudis var. integellus, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. This variant is adapted to salt spray and wind, making it resilient in harsh coastal environments."
