    "intro": "Rubus radula var. druidarum, commonly known as the Druid's Raspberry, is a rare variant of the common bramble species. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a slightly serrated edge, and its flowers are pale pink with five petals. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
