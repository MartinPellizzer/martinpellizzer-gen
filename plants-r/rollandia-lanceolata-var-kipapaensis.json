    "intro": "Rollandia lanceolata var. kipapaensis, commonly known as the Kipapa fern, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the Hawaiian Islands. This fern belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its lance-shaped, leathery fronds that are typically dark green in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often growing on rocky substrates or in forest understories. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, the species faces significant threats to its survival."
