It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features small, pale yellow flowers arranged in dense spikes, typical of many acacia species. It is adapted to dry conditions, with a deep root system for water absorption. The species is of interest for its ecological role in stabilizing soils in semi-arid environments."
