It features dense, mat-forming growth with small, aromatic leaves covered in fine, resinous hairs. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. Its compact size and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
