    "intro": "Reichelia guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan Reichelia, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly in regions of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its showy, pink or purple flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters, with simple, ovate leaves that are often hairy. Its fruits are capsule-like structures that release seeds when mature, contributing to its dispersal in the wild."
