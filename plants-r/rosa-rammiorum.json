    "intro": "Rosa rammiorum, commonly known as the everglade rose, is a species native to the wetlands of Florida and parts of the Caribbean. It is a shrub-like plant characterized by its slender, thornless stems and dense clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy or marshy environments. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a velvety texture, while its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. Rosa rammiorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
