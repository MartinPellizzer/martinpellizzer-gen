    "intro": "Ranunculus salsuginosus, commonly known as the salt marsh buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal areas of Europe and Asia. It thrives in saline and wet environments, such as salt marshes and tidal flats, and is adapted to withstand high soil salinity. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. It produces showy yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its ecological importance lies in its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for various invertebrates in its specialized habitat."
