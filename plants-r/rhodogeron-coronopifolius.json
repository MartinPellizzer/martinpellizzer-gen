    "intro": "Rhodogeron coronopifolius, commonly known as the golden star bush, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its arid environment. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a popular choice for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Rhodogeron coronopifolius is well adapted to sandy soils and full sun, thriving in coastal climates with minimal water requirements."
