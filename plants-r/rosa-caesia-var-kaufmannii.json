    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. kaufmannii, commonly known as the Kaufmann's evergreen rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a container plant."
