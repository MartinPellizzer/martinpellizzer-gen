    "intro": "Rhynchospora distans var. tenuis, commonly known as slender swamp grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist habitats, where it forms dense stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing pale yellow to greenish flowers. It is characterized by its slender stem and reduced leaf blades, which distinguish it from other varieties of Rhynchospora. This species plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
