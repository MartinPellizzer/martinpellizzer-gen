It features fleshy, upright stems with opposite, oval-shaped leaves that are typically green with red or purple markings. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established. Due to its compact growth habit and attractive foliage, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and containers."
