    "intro": "Rosa communis piliferae, commonly known as the hairy rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, fuzzy pubescence on its leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and serrated, with a leathery texture. The hairy rose is native to parts of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in perfumery."
