It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple achenes surrounded by a fleshy, hairy receptacle. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves and more compact growth habit compared to other Rubus species."
