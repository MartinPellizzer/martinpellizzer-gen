    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rosa guttensteinensis, commonly known as the Guttman rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky and alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring, which are typically clustered in small groups. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges and a dark green upper surface. Due to habitat loss and climate change, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
