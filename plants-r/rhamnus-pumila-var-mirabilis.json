    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila var. mirabilis, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of North America. It typically reaches heights of less than 30 centimeters and has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common component of alpine plant communities."
