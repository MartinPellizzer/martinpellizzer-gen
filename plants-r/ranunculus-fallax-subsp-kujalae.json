    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. kujalae, commonly known as the Kujalae buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Pakistan. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats at high altitudes. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
