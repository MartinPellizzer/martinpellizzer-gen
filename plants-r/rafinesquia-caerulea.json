    "intro": "Rafinesquia caerulea, commonly known as blue flax, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial species that produces striking blue to purple flower heads, which resemble small, clustered cones. The plant has a basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and can grow up to 2 to 3 feet tall. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rafinesquia caerulea is adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and along streambanks."
