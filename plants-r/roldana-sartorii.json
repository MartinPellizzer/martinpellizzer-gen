    "intro": "Roldana sartorii, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the warm season. Roldana sartorii thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
