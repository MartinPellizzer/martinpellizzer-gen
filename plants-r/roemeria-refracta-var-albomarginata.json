    "intro": "Roemeria refracta var. albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin roemeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves with distinct white margins. The plant produces clusters of small, pale blue to purple flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized collections."
