It features heart-shaped, velvety leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a houseplant. Its flowers emit a mild fragrance, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
