    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. omissoidea, commonly known as the woolly rose or the Indian rose, is a shrub-like species native to the Himalayas and parts of southern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a soft, white pubescence, contributing to its unique texture. Rosa tomentosa var. omissoidea is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
