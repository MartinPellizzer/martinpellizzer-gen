    "intro": "Rousseauxia minimifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved rousseauxia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tiny, lance-shaped leaves that are typically less than 1 centimeter in length. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the rainy season. Its growth is slow, and it thrives in shaded, humid environments with rich, well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
