    "intro": "Rhaphidorhynchus modestus, commonly known as the small-leafed daisy, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, clustered flowers that bloom in shades of white and pale yellow. The plant has hairy, narrow leaves that help reduce water loss in its dry environment. It produces small, wind-pollinated flowers and is often found growing in rocky soils. Rhaphidorhynchus modestus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil."
