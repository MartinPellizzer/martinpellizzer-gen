    "intro": "Rhododendron glaucophyllum var. tubiforme, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, leathery leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a tubular shape that distinguishes this variety from others in the species. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
