    "intro": "Rapanea australis, commonly known as the Australian wax tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the coastal regions of southeastern Australia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast against its rugged habitat. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by elliptical, red or orange fruits that split open to release its seeds. It is well adapted to salt-laden winds and sandy soils, making it a hardy species in coastal environments. Its ornamental value and resilience make it a popular choice for coastal landscaping and ecological restoration projects."
