    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 barrancoennensis, commonly known as the Barranco blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the Andean regions of South America, where it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces dark purple to black berries that are rich in antioxidants. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it flowers with white or pale pink petals. This species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other Rubus species."
