    "intro": "Roseocereus, commonly known as the \"snowy cactus,\" is a genus of cacti native to the Canary Islands. It features spiny stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, giving it a distinctive appearance. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a showy, tubular shape that attracts pollinators like moths and bats. These plants are adapted to arid environments, storing water in their thick, fleshy stems. They are prized in horticulture for their unique beauty and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
