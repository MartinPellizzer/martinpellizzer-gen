    "intro": "Riedlea nodiflora, commonly known as the fragrant mistletoe, is a hemiparasitic plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Loranthaceae and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, relying on its host for nutrients. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are often clustered in dense inflorescences. Its berries are typically red or orange, containing seeds that are dispersed by birds. Due to its parasitic nature, it can significantly affect the growth and health of its host plants."
