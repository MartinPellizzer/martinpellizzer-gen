It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as marshes, ponds, and stream sides. Its leaves are finely divided and have a hairy texture, which gives it its common name.
