    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. subglobosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or subglobous rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, fluffy appearance. The leaves are typically oval to elliptical, with a soft, hairy texture, and the flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often grown in gardens for its visual appeal and hardiness. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a resilient addition to rock gardens or borders."
