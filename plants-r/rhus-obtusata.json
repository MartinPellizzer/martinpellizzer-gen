    "intro": "Rhus obtusata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It belongs to the Anacardiaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some animals. Smooth sumac thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
