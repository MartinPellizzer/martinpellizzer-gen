    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 refertus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black or dark red when mature, containing numerous druplets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable species for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
