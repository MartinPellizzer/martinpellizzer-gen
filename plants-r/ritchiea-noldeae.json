    "intro": "Ritchiea noldeae, commonly known as the Nolde's cycad, is a rare and unique species native to the island of Grande-Terre in the French archipelago of Saint-Martin. This plant belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of feathery, pinnate leaves. It is adapted to the humid, tropical climate of its native habitat, thriving in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, Ritchiea noldeae is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this botanical rarity."
