    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. subcalvescens, commonly known as the dwarf bank rose, is a compact shrub native to the western United States. It features narrow, arching stems with small, dark green leaves that are typically covered in fine, silvery-white hairs. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often borne on short pedicels and are adapted for pollination by insects. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its low growth habit and ornamental value."
