It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds. Rosa olens is often used in hedges due to its dense growth and historical use in ornamental gardening. It is also valued for its role in traditional herbal medicine."
