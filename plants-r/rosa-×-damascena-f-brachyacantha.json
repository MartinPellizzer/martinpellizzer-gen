    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 damascena f. brachyacantha, commonly known as the short-stalked damask rose, is a botanical hybrid within the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and shorter stems compared to typical Rosa \u00d7 damascena varieties. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, providing a lush backdrop to the flowers. This form is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions."
