    "intro": "Rhamnus pirifolia, commonly known as the pineapple tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its spiny branches and opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers followed by distinctive, fleshy, red or yellow berries. These berries are edible and have a sweet, slightly tart flavor, making them popular in local cuisines. Rhamnus pirifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its fruit and medicinal properties."
