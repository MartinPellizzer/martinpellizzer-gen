    "intro": "Rosa pseudocampta, commonly known as the narrowleaf wild rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of North America, particularly the central and eastern United States. The plant is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, while the fruits are red, berry-like hips that mature in the fall. Rosa pseudocampta is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
