    "intro": "Rapuntium coronopifolium var. latifolium, commonly known as the broadleaf crownfoe, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its broad, lance-shaped leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, which bloom in early summer. The plant is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. The species is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to tolerate dry conditions."
