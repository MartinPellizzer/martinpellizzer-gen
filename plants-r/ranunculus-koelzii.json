    "intro": "Ranunculus koelzii, commonly known as the Koelz's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, delicate yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has basal leaves that are palmately divided, often with lobes that are sharply toothed. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native range."
