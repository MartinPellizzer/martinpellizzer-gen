    "intro": "Rhus trilobata var. quinata, commonly known as the Texas persimmon, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically three-lobed and have a distinctive, slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange to red berries that mature in the fall. These berries are edible for humans and wildlife but contain a high concentration of tannins, making them bitter unless fully ripe. The Texas persimmon is often found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments."
