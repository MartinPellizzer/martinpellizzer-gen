It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that resembles the leaves of boxwood plants. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in shaded, moist forest environments. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
