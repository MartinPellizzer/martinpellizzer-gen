    "intro": "Razoumofskya douglasii var. abietinum, commonly known as the Douglas fir, is a coniferous evergreen tree native to western North America. It is characterized by its tall, slender form and distinctive, scale-like leaves that are dark green on top and whitish underneath. The tree produces cones that mature over two years, with the female cones releasing seeds in the fall. Its bark is thick and deeply furrowed, providing protection against wildfires and pests. This species is valued for its durability and is commonly used in construction and as a Christmas tree."
