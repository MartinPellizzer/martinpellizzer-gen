    "intro": "Rudbeckia citriodora, commonly known as lemonhead coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and a distinctive, cone-shaped center that turns brown as it matures. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 3 feet and thrives in full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Rudbeckia citriodora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
