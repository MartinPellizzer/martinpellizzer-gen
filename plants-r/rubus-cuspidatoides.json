    "intro": "Rubus cuspidatoides, commonly known as the prickly rose or rough blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
