    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei var. exacutatus, commonly known as the sharp-tipped blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus characterized by its distinctive, sharply pointed leaves and thorny stems. It typically grows in temperate regions, often in woodland edges or disturbed soils, and is well adapted to moist, partially shaded environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color, with a slightly tart flavor. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This species is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its potential use in local ecosystems."
