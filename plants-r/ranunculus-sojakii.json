It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow, white, or pink. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are hairy and often branched. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to temperate to alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is primarily found in the wild."
