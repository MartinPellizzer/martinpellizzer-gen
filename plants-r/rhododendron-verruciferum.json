    "intro": "Rhododendron verruciferum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist climates with high elevation. Its leaves are typically broad and leathery, and the flowers are often borne in racemes. Rhododendron verruciferum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
