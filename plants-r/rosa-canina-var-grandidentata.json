    "intro": "Rosa canina var. grandidentata, commonly known as the large-toothed dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with large, serrated leaflets. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, orange-red hips that persist into winter. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine. The variety is distinguished by its larger, more pronounced leaf teeth compared to the typical Rosa canina."
