    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 assurgens var. polyadenes, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
