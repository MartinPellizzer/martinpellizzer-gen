    "intro": "Robinia violacea, commonly known as the purplewood acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often multi-branched stems and trifoliate leaves composed of three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, fragrant, violet-blue flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like fruits that split open when mature, dispersing the seeds by wind. Robinia violacea is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in coastal and heathland environments."
