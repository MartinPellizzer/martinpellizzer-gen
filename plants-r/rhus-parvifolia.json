    "intro": "Rhus parvifolia, commonly known as the littleleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Rhus parvifolia thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and ornamental use in native gardens."
