    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. nemoralis, commonly known as the bramble rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces rose hips, which are orange-red, fuzzy fruits containing seeds. It thrives in woodland edges and dry, sunny habitats, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a persistent weed in agricultural areas."
