    "intro": "Rhysolepis tucumanensis, commonly known as Tucum\u00e1n mountain grass, is a perennial grass native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant typically grows in high-altitude grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its inflorescence consists of a panicle of small, spikelet-like flowers, which are wind-pollinated. Rhysolepis tucumanensis plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
