    "intro": "Ranunculus pseudoparviflorus, commonly known as the dwarf meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. It has palmately divided leaves and produces small, seed-like fruits that disperse via the wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
