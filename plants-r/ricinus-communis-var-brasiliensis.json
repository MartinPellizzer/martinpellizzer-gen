It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic, hairy seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. Its ornamental value is notable, though caution is necessary due to its harmful properties."
