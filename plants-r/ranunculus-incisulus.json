    "intro": "Ranunculus incisulus, commonly known as the cut-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
