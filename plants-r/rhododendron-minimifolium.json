    "intro": "Rhododendron minimifolium, commonly known as the dwarfleaf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and slow growth rate, it is often used in rock gardens and as a specimen plant."
