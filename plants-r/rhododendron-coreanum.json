    "intro": "Rhododendron coreanum, commonly known as the Korean rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Korea and parts of China. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant floral display and its role in traditional horticulture in its native region."
