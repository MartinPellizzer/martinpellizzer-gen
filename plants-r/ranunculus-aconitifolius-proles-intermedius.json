    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius proles intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate aconite leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces basal leaves that are deeply lobed and resemble those of aconite. The plant bears showy, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and protected areas."
