    "intro": "Rorippa curvipes var. alpina, commonly known as the alpine watercress, is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its small, edible leaves and yellow flowers. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine regions. The plant has a rosette of basal leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, clustered flowers that are pollinated by insects. This variant is adapted to cold climates and can tolerate frost, making it a hardy species in mountainous environments."
