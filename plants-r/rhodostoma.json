    "intro": "Rhodostoma, commonly known as the red-tongued orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, showy flowers that often feature a bright red or orange lip, which is a key identifying feature. The plants are typically epiphytic, meaning they grow on other plants without being parasitic, and they are often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Rhodostoma species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are cultivated for their vibrant blooms. Their botanical significance lies in their role in diverse ecosystems and their contribution to the biodiversity of orchids."
