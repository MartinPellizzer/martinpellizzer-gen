    "intro": "Rindera media, commonly known as the broad-leafed orchid, is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, lance-shaped leaves that are typically green with a waxy texture. The plant produces striking, fragrant flowers in shades of white, pink, and purple, often with intricate patterns. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
