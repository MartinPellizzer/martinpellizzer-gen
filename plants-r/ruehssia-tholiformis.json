    "intro": "Ruehssia tholiformis, commonly known as the golden star vine, is a tropical climbing plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, woody stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom throughout the year. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly waxy texture. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental horticulture for its attractive foliage and flowering habit. Due to its rapid growth, it is sometimes considered invasive in certain regions."
