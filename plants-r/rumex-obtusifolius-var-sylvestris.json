    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. sylvestris, commonly known as the woodland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green and have a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually reddish or greenish in color, blooming in the spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid."
