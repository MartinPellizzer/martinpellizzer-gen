The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. It is valued for its unique foliage and delicate floral display, making it a sought-after species in botanical gardens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
