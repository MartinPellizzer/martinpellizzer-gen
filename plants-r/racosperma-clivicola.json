    "intro": "Racosperma clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rock fig, is a small shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and is often found growing on rocky outcrops and cliff faces. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by edible, fig-like fruits. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Racosperma clivicola is well adapted to coastal conditions, tolerating salt spray and sandy soils."
