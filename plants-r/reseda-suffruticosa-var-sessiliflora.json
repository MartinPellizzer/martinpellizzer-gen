    "intro": "Reseda suffruticosa var. sessiliflora, commonly known as the narrow-leaved madder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring upright, branched stems covered in fine hairs. The leaves are elliptical to lanceolate, with a sessile or nearly sessile attachment to the stem, giving it its botanical name. Its small, clustered flowers are usually pink to purple, blooming from late spring to early summer. This plant is often found in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils, and it has been historically used for its dye-producing roots."
