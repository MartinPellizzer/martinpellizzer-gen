    "intro": "Rubus lamprocaulos, commonly known as the silver-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is part of the Rubus genus, which includes many other brambles and blackberry species."
