    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. subcrossodonta, commonly known as the pendulous rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its cascading growth habit and delicate, fragrant flowers. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to specific regions in Central America, where it thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. The plant features slender, arching stems that bear clusters of small, pink to white blooms, which are often accompanied by soft, velvety foliage. Its botanical interest lies in its unique morphology and adaptability to humid environments, making it a subject of study in horticultural botany. The variety subcrossodonta is distinguished by subtle differences in leaf structure and floral characteristics compared to the typical Rosa pendulina."
