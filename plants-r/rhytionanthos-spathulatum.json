    "intro": "Rhytionanthos spathulatum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf torchflower, is a striking member of the Acanthaceae family. It is native to South Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, showy orange-red bracts that resemble flames. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, tubular flowers clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its unique appearance and relatively low maintenance, it is often cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions."
