    "intro": "Rosa communis proles gratianopolitana, commonly known as the Gratiopolitan rose, is a variety of Rosa rugosa, characterized by its vibrant pink flowers and robust growth habit. It is native to eastern Europe and thrives in temperate climates, preferring well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to gardens. Its hardy nature makes it suitable for coastal areas due to its resistance to salt spray and wind. The Gratiopolitan rose is also valued for its edible hips, which can be used in jams and teas."
