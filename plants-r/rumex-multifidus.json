    "intro": "Rumex multifidus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, deeply lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on tall, erect stems. Rumex multifidus thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in meadows, along riverbanks, and in disturbed areas. It is valued for its medicinal properties and has been used historically in herbal remedies."
