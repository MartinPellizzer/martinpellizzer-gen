    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 schmidtii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is typically found in moist, calcareous soils in temperate regions. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
