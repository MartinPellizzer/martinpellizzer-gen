    "intro": "Rostrinucula, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare and unique flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its distinctive, elongated floral structure that resembles a horn. The plant produces small, fragrant blooms that are often white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. Rostrinucula thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found growing in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
