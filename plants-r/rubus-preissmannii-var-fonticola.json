    "intro": "Rubus preissmannii var. fonticola, commonly known as the Fonticola blackberry, is a shrub native to the wetlands and streamside habitats of South America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems and small, clustered white or pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
