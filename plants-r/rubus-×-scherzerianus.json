    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 scherzerianus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus fruticosus (brambles) and Rubus ideaus (red raspberries). It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically range in color from red to black. The plant produces small, oval leaves with serrated edges and is often found in temperate regions. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for cultivation in gardens. The fruit is edible, though it has a more tart flavor compared to typical raspberries."
