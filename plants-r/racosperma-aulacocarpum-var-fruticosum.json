    "intro": "Racosperma aulacocarpum var. fruticosum, commonly known as the sturt's desert peaberry, is a shrub native to arid regions of Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and hard, angular pods. The plant is adapted to survive in dry, nutrient-poor soils, with deep roots that help it access groundwater. Its leaves are typically small and hairy, reducing water loss through transpiration. The fruit is a dry, dehiscent pod that releases seeds when mature, aiding in its dispersal in the harsh environment."
