    "intro": "Rosa mollis subf. eidensis, commonly known as the Edelweiss, is a rare and alpine plant native to the European Alps. It is characterized by its dense, white to pale yellow florets surrounded by soft, velvety bracts. The plant thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and well-drained soil. Its flowers bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a protected species in many regions."
