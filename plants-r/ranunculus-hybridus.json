It is characterized by its showy, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange and red. The plant has palmate leaves with deep lobes and a hairy stem that often grows from the base. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, it thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
