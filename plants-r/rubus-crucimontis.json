    "intro": "Rubus crucimontis, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
