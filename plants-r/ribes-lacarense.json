It is a shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but not widely cultivated. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have a serrated margin. Ribes lacarense is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in harsh conditions."
