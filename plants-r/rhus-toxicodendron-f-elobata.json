    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron f. elobata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it has a shallow root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil types. The plant is also known for its allelopathic properties, which can inhibit the growth of nearby plants."
