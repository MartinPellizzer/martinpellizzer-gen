    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. asperifrons, commonly known as the rough-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its slightly hairy, rough-textured fruit surface, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. This subspecies is valued for its unique appearance and is often found in horticultural collections."
