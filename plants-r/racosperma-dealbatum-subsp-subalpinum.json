    "intro": "Racosperma dealbatum subsp. subalpinum, commonly known as the alpine racosperma, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming during the cooler months. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh, alpine conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
