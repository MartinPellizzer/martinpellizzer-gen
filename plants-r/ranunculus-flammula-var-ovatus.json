    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. ovatus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has smooth, waxy leaves that are alternate and often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread and form dense mats, making it both ecologically significant and sometimes invasive."
