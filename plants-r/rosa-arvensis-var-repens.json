    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. repens, commonly known as creeping red sanders, is a low-growing perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread rapidly across the ground. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval leaflets with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides."
