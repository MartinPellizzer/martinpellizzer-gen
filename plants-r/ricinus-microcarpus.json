    "intro": "Ricinus microcarpus, commonly known as the dwarf castor or small-seeded castor, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and spiny calyx. The plant produces small, red berries that contain toxic seeds, which are not suitable for human consumption. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance. Despite its ornamental value, it requires careful handling due to the toxic properties of its seeds."
