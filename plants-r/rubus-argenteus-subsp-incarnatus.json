It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and fruit."
