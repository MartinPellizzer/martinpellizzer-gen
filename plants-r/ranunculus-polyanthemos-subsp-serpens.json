    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos subsp. serpens, commonly known as the serpent's head buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central Asia. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers with a distinctive, deeply lobed corolla. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments such as meadows and stream banks. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense colonies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
