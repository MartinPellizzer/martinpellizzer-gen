    "intro": "Rhynchosia confusa, commonly known as the African beggar's tick, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-white flowers that are clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its slender, twining stems and the presence of hooked hairs on its stems and leaves, which aid in its climbing habit. Its fruit is a legume pod that contains several seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural areas. Rhynchosia confusa is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
