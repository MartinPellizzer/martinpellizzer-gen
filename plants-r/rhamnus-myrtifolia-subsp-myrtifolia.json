    "intro": "Rhamnus myrtifolia subsp. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with glossy, oval-shaped leaves that have a distinctive myrtle-like scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. Its bark is smooth and often reddish-brown, and it can grow up to 5 meters in height. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
