It features a fibrous root system and produces tall, erect stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and green, with a prominent midrib. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of spikelets arranged in a panicle, which is a characteristic feature of the grass family. Rottboellia corymbosa is often found in disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
