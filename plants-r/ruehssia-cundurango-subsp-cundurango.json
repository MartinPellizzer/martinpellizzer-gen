It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as cloud forests and high-altitude grasslands. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are narrow and grass-like. It produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are borne on long, slender inflorescences. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens for its unique appearance."
