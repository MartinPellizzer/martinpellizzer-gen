    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia var. parvifolia, commonly known as the small-leaved garden rose, is a hybrid rose species prized for its fragrant, pink to white flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate leaves compared to other Rosa \u00d7 centifolia varieties. The plant is native to France and has been cultivated for centuries for its ornamental value and perfume. It typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing clusters of small, sweet-scented blooms. This variety is well-suited for garden borders, containers, and as a shrub in temperate climates."
