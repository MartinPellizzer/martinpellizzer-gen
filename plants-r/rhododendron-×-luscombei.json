The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 10 meters. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native habitats."
