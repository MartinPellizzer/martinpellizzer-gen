    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium var. nivalis, commonly known as the snow bulb, is a perennial geophyte native to the alpine regions of southern Africa. It produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears showy, yellowish-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure. The plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its bulbs serve as storage organs, enabling it to survive harsh winters and periods of drought. This variety is particularly noted for its striking appearance and ecological significance in its native habitat."
