    "intro": "Roystonea venezuelana, commonly known as the Venezuelan fan palm, is a striking member of the Arecaceae family native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant thrives in warm, tropical climates and is often found in coastal areas and limestone soils. Its flowers are small and clustered, typically appearing in yellow or greenish hues, and it produces edible fruits that are consumed by various wildlife. Roystonea venezuelana is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological importance in supporting local biodiversity."
