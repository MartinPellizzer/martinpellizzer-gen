    "intro": "Remya mauiensis, commonly known as Maui's remya, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Maui in Hawaii. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in the humid climate. Due to its limited habitat and susceptibility to invasive species, Remya mauiensis is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
