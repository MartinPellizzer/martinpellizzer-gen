    "intro": "Rubus bellardii var. exigeios, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that are typically less showy than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
