    "intro": "Rhus cuneata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that attract birds and other wildlife. Rhus cuneata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed areas. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in many eastern U.S. regions."
