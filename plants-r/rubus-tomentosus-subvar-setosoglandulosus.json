It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and hairy, glandular leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a woolly texture. It produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. This plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
