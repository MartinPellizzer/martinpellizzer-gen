    "intro": "Rhynchopyle marginata, commonly known as the margins-edge plant, is a rare species belonging to the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves that have distinct margins. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate environments, often near streams or in shaded forest understories. Its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of florets, which are wind-pollinated. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rhynchopyle marginata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
