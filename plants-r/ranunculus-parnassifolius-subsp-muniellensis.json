    "intro": "Ranunculus parnassifolius subsp. muniellensis, commonly known as the Parnassian buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals and deeply lobed, palmately arranged leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine and subalpine habitats. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in several regions."
