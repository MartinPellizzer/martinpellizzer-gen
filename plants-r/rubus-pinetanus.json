    "intro": "Rubus pinetanus, commonly known as the pineberry blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically clustered in dense, thorny inflorescences. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but are not as widely cultivated as other Rubus species."
