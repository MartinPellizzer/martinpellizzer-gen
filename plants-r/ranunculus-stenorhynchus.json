It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streambanks. It has palmately divided leaves and produces small, green fruits that contain seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
