    "intro": "Rosa communis var. caerulescens, commonly known as the blue rose, is a rare and highly sought-after variant of the common rose. This cultivar is notable for its striking blue-pink petals, a coloration achieved through a complex interaction of pigments and genetics rather than the typical red or pink hues of most roses. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with thorny stems and glossy, dark green foliage. It produces fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a unique visual appeal to gardens. Due to its rarity and aesthetic value, Rosa communis var. caerulescens is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
