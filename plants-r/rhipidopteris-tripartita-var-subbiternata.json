    "intro": "Rhipidopteris tripartita var. subbiternata, commonly known as the three-parted fern, is a variant of the tripartita fern species. It is a perennial plant that typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in temperate forests. The plant is characterized by its compound fronds, which are divided into three distinct segments, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its reproductive structures, including spore-bearing capsules, are located on the undersides of the fronds. This fern is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
