It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, white or pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. Native to parts of Asia and the Americas, it thrives in temperate climates and well-drained soil. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for hedging and garden planting."
