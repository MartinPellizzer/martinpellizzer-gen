It belongs to the family Ephedraceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy stems and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring. It is adapted to harsh environments, with thick cuticles and specialized storage tissues to conserve water. Reaumuria kermanensis plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
