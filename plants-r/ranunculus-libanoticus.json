    "intro": "Ranunculus libanoticus, commonly known as the Lebanese buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Lebanon and Syria. It is a perennial herb with delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of yellow and white. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, hairy seed pods that split open to release its seeds. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in dry, sunny environments. Ranunculus libanoticus is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been historically used in traditional medicine."
