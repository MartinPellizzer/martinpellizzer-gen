    "intro": "Ranunculus sardous var. macrocarpus, commonly known as the Sardinian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the island of Sardinia. It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with prominent, rounded sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and rocky areas. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in its native region."
