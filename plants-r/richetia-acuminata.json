It is a perennial herb that typically grows in rocky or limestone soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white or pinkish flowers in early spring. It is often found in dry, sunny environments and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
