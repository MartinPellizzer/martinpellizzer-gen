    "intro": "Rauvolfia flexuosa, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and Australia. It is a climbing vine with heart-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into red berries. The plant contains alkaloids, notably reserpine, which has been historically used in traditional medicine for its hypotensive properties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical significance lies in both its medicinal value and its role in ecological systems."
