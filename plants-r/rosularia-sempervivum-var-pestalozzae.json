    "intro": "Rosularia sempervivum var. pestalozzae, commonly known as the Pestalozza's stonecrop, is a low-growing succulent with dense clusters of fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a rosette. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange during the summer months. Native to the Dolomites in Italy, this plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and full sun. It is drought-tolerant and requires minimal care, making it ideal for rock gardens or alpine settings. The variety is named after the Italian educator Pestalozza, reflecting its historical significance in botanical nomenclature."
