    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri subsp. trichopus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a shrub native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in regions of China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine, hairy pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest undergrowth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
