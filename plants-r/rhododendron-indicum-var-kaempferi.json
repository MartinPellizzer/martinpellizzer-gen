    "intro": "Rhododendron indicum var. kaempferi, commonly known as the Japanese azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, typically blooming in spring. The plant has broad, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and ability to form dense thickets."
