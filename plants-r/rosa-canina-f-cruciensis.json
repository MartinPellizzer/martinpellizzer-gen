    "intro": "Rosa canina f. cruciensis, commonly known as the cross-leaved dog rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose species. It is characterized by its distinctive, crisscrossed leaf venation, which sets it apart from other Rosa canina forms. This shrub typically grows in temperate regions and produces pink or white flowers that bloom in early summer. The fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges and open habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
