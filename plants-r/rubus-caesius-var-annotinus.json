    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. annotinus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark purple to nearly black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of the standard Rubus caesius. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, making it a popular choice for both cultivation and wildlife habitats."
