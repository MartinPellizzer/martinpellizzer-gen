    "intro": "Rosa canina var. spinulifolia, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Its fruits, known as hips, are orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This plant is often found in woodland edges and scrublands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
