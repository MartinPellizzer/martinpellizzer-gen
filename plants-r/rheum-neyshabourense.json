    "intro": "Rheum neyshabourense, commonly known as the Neyshabour rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the high-altitude regions of Iran. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces tall, clustered flowering stalks that bear small, greenish-white flowers. Its rhubarb-like stems are edible but are typically not consumed due to their tart flavor and fibrous texture. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its unique morphology and potential medicinal properties."
