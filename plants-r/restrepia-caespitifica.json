    "intro": "Restrepia caespitifica, commonly known as the clustered restrepia, is a terrestrial orchid native to South America, particularly found in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, clumping growth habit, with multiple pseudobulbs forming a compact rosette. The plant produces slender, arching stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers with a distinct, fragrant scent. Its leaves are strap-like and grassy in appearance, contributing to its ornamental value. Restrepia caespitifica thrives in cool, humid environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
