    "intro": "Rubus sorsogonensis, commonly known as the Sorsogon Province raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
