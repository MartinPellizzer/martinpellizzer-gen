    "intro": "Rumex palustris var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf sorrel, is a low-growing perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe. It features heart-shaped, reddish-veined leaves that are typically less than 5 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often obscured by the foliage. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Due to its compact size and ornamental leaves, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
