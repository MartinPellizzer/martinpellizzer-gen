    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus var. catalaunicus, commonly known as the Catalan yellow rattle, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and disturbed soils. Its presence is often an indicator of nutrient-rich, well-drained soils."
