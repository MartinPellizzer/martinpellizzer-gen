    "intro": "Rheum cruentum, commonly known as Indian rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its large, broad, and often deeply lobed leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in length. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in panicles during the summer months. Its rhizomes are thick and fleshy, containing high levels of anthraquinones, which have been used in traditional medicine. The plant is also cultivated for its ornamental value due to its striking foliage."
