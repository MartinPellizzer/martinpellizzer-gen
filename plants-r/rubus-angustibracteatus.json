    "intro": "Rubus angustibracteatus, commonly known as the narrow-bract raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by wildlife but are not widely cultivated for human consumption. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has a distinctive, aromatic scent."
