    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. stabilis, commonly known as the stable buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine broad, petal-like sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth habit compared to other members of the species."
