    "intro": "Rubus nemoralis var. argyriophyllus, commonly known as the silver-leaf bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically less vigorous than those of the standard Rubus nemoralis. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
