It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more robust than those of the standard Rubus vulgaris. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, making them popular for culinary use."
