    "intro": "Rabdochloa vulpiastrum, commonly known as the foxglove fern, is a rare and delicate plant native to the cloud forests of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its finely divided, lance-shaped leaves that form a dense, compact rosette. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures called sporangia, which are typically located on the underside of the leaves. Rabdochloa vulpiastrum thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high levels of atmospheric moisture to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
