It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark, shiny berries that are a food source for birds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The species is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
