    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 liptoviensis, commonly known as the hybrid common toadflax, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is a sterile hybrid between Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus sarmentosus, resulting in unique morphological traits. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as meadows and roadsides. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not found in the wild and is often cultivated for its ornamental value."
