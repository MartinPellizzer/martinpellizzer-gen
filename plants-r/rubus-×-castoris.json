    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 castoris, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus fruticosus (bramble) and Rubus occidentalis (blackberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits characteristics of both parents. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its thorny stems and dense growth habit make it both a useful hedgerow plant and a challenging weed."
