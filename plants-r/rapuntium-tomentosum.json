    "intro": "Rapuntium tomentosum, commonly known as the woolly cress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is found in temperate regions across Europe and parts of Asia. Its seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing easily by wind. The species is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine."
