    "intro": "Rinorea talbotii, commonly known as the Talbot's rinorea, is a small evergreen shrub native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are often elliptical in shape and have a smooth or slightly hairy surface. It produces small, pale pink or white flowers that are clustered in terminal panicles, and it is typically found in moist, shaded habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, Rinorea talbotii is considered a rare and endemic species."
