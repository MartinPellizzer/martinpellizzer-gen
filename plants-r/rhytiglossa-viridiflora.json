    "intro": "Rhytiglossa viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in a spike, which bloom during the wet season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the orchid family."
