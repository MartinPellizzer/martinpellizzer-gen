    "intro": "Rhopalopilia pallens, commonly known as the white-flowered cycad, is a species of cycad native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, yellowish male cones and large, spherical female cones that develop into seed-containing pods. Rhopalopilia pallens thrives in warm, sunny environments and is adapted to dry, well-drained soils. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but vulnerable species in its native range."
