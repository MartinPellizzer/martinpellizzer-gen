It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant features broad, waxy leaves and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red. Ronabia is adapted to survive in hot, dry climates with minimal water requirements. Its flowers bloom during the day and close at night, a trait known as nyctinasty."
