    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus var. isophyllus, commonly known as the three-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is divided into three leaflets, which are usually serrated and hairy. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental gardening and ecological restoration projects."
