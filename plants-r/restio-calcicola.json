    "intro": "Restio calcicola, commonly known as the limestone restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to arid and coastal environments. This species is typically found growing in rocky, well-drained soils, often in areas with high sunlight exposure. Its slender, grass-like stems are often mistaken for grasses, but it produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny white or pale blue flowers. Restio calcicola is well-suited to dry conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
