    "intro": "Rubus oculus-junonis, commonly known as the eye of June, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The plant thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, showing adaptability to a range of environmental conditions."
