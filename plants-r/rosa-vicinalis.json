    "intro": "Rosa vicinalis, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground or climb over other vegetation. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of pinnate leaves with five to seven leaflets, and it is often found in moist, shaded environments. Rosa vicinalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
