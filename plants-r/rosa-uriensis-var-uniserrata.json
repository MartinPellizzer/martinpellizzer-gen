    "intro": "Rosa uriensis var. uniserrata, commonly known as the single-toothed wild rose, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its simple, single-serrated leaf margins, which distinguish it from other rose varieties. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its thorny stems and evergreen foliage make it a hardy, ornamental shrub. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, well-drained soils."
