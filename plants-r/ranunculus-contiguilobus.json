    "intro": "Ranunculus contiguilobus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with a waxy coating and produces small, yellow flowers with five petals. Its roots are fibrous and can spread to form dense mats, which helps it colonize new areas. Ranunculus contiguilobus is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its aggressive growth habit."
