    "intro": "Rorippa underwoodii, commonly known as the underwood's watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to North America. It typically grows in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, often forming dense mats on the surface of water. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, alternate leaves that are usually submerged or floating. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, clustered in racemes, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that split open when mature. Rorippa underwoodii is valued for its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for aquatic organisms."
