It is characterized by its smooth, silver-gray bark and pinnately compound leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The tree produces fragrant, pale yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its wood is hard and durable, historically used for furniture and shipbuilding. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
