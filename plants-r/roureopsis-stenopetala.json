It belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae and is characterized by its compact, low-growing habit. The plant produces small, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, often blooming in spring. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, which help it retain moisture in arid environments.
