It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full sunlight. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long-lasting blooms, making it a popular choice for gardens and floral arrangements. The leaves are usually covered in a fine, white to grayish pubescence, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
