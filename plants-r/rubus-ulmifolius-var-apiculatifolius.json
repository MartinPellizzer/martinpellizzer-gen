    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. apiculatifolius, commonly known as the bristly blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry with distinct botanical features. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are usually serrated and have a distinctive bristly texture. The leaves are typically narrower and more pointed compared to the standard Rubus ulmifolius. It produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a sweet and tart flavor. This variant is often found in temperate regions and is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities."
