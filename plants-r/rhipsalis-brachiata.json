    "intro": "Rhipsalis brachiata, commonly known as the mistletoe cactus, is a unique epiphytic plant native to tropical regions of South America. It lacks true leaves and instead has modified stems that serve as photosynthetic structures. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its stems are typically long and trailing, allowing it to grow along tree branches or in shaded environments. Rhipsalis brachiata is well adapted to low-light conditions and requires high humidity to thrive."
