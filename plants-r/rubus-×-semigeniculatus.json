    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semigeniculatus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in different populations."
