    "intro": "Rubus pubescens f. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its narrower, more elongated leaves. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly the western United States. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the common blackberry. It is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks, thriving in well-drained soils. The foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance."
