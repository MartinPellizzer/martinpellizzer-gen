    "intro": "Rapuntium ericoides, commonly known as the dwarf heath, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and arranged in dense clusters. The plant produces clusters of pale pink or white flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, dark blue berries. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or heathland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
