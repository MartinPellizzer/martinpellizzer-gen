    "intro": "Ranunculus aotearoanus, commonly known as the Aotearoa buttercup, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in damp, shaded areas such as forest floors and wetlands. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish sepals that surround the petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
