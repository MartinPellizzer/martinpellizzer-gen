    "intro": "Ruschia curta, commonly known as the dwarf ice plant, is a succulent species native to South Africa. It features compact, mat-forming growth with fleshy, blue-green leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
