It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including parts of China, Mongolia, and Russia. The plant is characterized by its trailing stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it produces rose hips that are rich in vitamin C. Rosa arcuata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
