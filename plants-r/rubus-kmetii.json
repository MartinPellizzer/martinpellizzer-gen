    "intro": "Rubus kmetii, commonly known as the Kmeti raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color, with a tangy flavor. The plant has thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive plant in its native habitat."
