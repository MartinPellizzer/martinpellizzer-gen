It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in arid and semi-arid environments. The botanical features of this variant make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its fruit structure and habitat preferences."
