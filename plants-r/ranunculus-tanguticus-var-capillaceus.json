    "intro": "Ranunculus tanguticus var. capillaceus, commonly known as the silky buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the Tibetan Plateau and adjacent regions. It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Its leaves are palmately divided and often covered in fine, silky hairs, contributing to its common name. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
