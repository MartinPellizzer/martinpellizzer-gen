    "intro": "Radlkoferella grandis, commonly known as the giant radlkoferella, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its large, showy yellow-orange composite flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are broad, hairy, and arranged in a rosette pattern, helping it retain moisture in arid conditions. Radlkoferella grandis is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance and resilience to harsh climates."
