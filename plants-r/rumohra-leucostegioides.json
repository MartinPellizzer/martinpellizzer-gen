    "intro": "Rumohra leucostegioides, commonly known as the white-stemmed sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like leaves and cylindrical, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland or swampy environments, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils. Its flowering stems are often covered in a white or pale bloom, which gives it its common name. Rumohra leucostegioides plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
