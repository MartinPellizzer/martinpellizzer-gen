    "intro": "Rottboellia beyreichii, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it a common weed in disturbed areas. Rottboellia beyreichii is often used in ornamental gardening for its striking color and texture."
