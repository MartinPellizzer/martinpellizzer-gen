It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, upright stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces striking, star-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
