    "intro": "Rubus amphibolus, commonly known as the waterberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other raspberries. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to wet soils, making it a common sight along stream banks and in moist woodlands. The plant has been used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
