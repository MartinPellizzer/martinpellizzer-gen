    "intro": "Ruprechtia albida, commonly known as the white ruprechtia, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and clusters of small, white, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained, acidic soil. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruprechtia albida is considered a vulnerable species."
