    "intro": "Rutidea smithii var. subcordata, commonly known as the narrow-leafed Rutidea, is a perennial shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, subcordate leaves that are typically less than 2 inches in length. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
