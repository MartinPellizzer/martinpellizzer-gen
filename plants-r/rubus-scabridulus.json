    "intro": "Rubus scabridulus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a red or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is considered a common weed in many parts of its native range."
