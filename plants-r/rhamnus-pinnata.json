    "intro": "Rhamnus pinnata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its opposite, simple, and often glossy dark green leaves that turn red or orange in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age."
