    "intro": "Rubus acerifolius, commonly known as the maple-leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves that resemble those of maple trees, with serrated edges and a deep green color. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
