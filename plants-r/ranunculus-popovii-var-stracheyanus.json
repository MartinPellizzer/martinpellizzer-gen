    "intro": "Ranunculus popovii var. stracheyanus, commonly known as the Strachey's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 15\u201330 cm and thrives in well-drained, moist soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats, where it tolerates cool temperatures and full sun. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to flourish."
