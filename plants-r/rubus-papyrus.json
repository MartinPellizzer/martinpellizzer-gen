    "intro": "Rubus papyrus, commonly known as the sacred papyrus plant, is a tall, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the Nile River region. It has large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 1 meter in width. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the summer. Its stems are fibrous and were historically used to make papyrus paper in ancient Egypt. The plant thrives in wetland environments and is adapted to tolerate both freshwater and brackish conditions."
