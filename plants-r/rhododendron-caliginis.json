    "intro": "Rhododendron caliginis, commonly known as the misty rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of Nepal, India, and Bhutan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist, and shaded environments at high elevations. The plant features lance-shaped leaves that are often densely covered with glandular hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh habitat. Its flowers are usually pink to purple, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron caliginis plays an important ecological role in its native habitat by providing nectar for pollinators and shelter for various wildlife species."
