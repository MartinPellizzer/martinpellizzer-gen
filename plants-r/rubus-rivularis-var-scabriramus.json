    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. scabriramus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features thorny stems covered in a rough, pubescent texture, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit, a small, dark purple berry, is edible and often used in jams and desserts."
