It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. The plants typically have showy, often pale or white flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. They are characterized by their woody stems and palmate leaves, which are often lobed or deeply divided.
