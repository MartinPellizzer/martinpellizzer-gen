    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. stygmatotes, commonly known as the Stygmatote rose, is a rare and distinctive subspecies of the Rosa dumalis species. It is characterized by its narrow, arching stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to red. The plant is native to specific regions in Central Asia, where it thrives in rocky, arid environments. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces hips that are often used in traditional medicine. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable and endangered flora species."
