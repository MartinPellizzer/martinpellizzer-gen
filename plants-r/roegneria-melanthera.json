    "intro": "Roegneria melanthera, commonly known as black oatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open woodlands, meadows, and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant has slender,\u4e1b\u751f stems that often form dense clumps, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually blue-green in color. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are tightly clustered, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria melanthera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
