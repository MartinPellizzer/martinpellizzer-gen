    "intro": "Rogiera pittieri, commonly known as the Pittier's orchid, is a rare and delicate species native to the high-altitude regions of Ecuador. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers with intricate patterns. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocky substrates or in cloud forests. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its inflorescence consists of a single, showy flower. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rogiera pittieri is considered a conservation concern."
