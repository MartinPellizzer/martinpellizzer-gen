    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. monticola, commonly known as the mountain yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow, tubular flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It thrives in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in several countries."
