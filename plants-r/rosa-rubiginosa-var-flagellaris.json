It is characterized by its thorny stems that often trail along the ground, giving it a creeping growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white, followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. Its leaves are pinnate, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and slightly toothed. This species is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas of southern Europe."
