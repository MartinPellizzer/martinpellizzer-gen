    "intro": "Rhododendron degronianum var. heptamerum, commonly known as the seven-bracted rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in mountain forests with rich, acidic soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while the flowers range from pink to deep red, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
