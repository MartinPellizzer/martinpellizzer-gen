    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. intermixta, commonly known as the Japanese cherry rose, is a compact shrub native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and profuse display of small, single or semi-double pink to white flowers. The plant produces oval, fuzzy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, adding visual interest throughout the growing season. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and container planting. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to bloom multiple times throughout the spring and early summer."
