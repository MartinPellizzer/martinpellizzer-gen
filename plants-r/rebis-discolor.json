    "intro": "Rebis discolor, commonly known as the variable thistle, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its spiny, purple-tinged leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny grasslands and rocky soils. Its scientific name reflects the variability in its appearance, particularly in leaf and flower coloration. Rebis discolor is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory properties."
