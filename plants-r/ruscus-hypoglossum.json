    "intro": "Ruscus hypoglossum, commonly known as common spurge or evergreen spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features dense clusters of fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ruscus hypoglossum is often used in rock gardens and as a ground cover due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance."
