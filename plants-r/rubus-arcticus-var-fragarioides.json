    "intro": "Rubus arcticus var. fragarioides, commonly known as the arctic bramble, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions. It has slender, woody stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, juicy berries that are edible. It thrives in cold climates and is adapted to poor, rocky soils. This species plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
