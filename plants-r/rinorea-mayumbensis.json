    "intro": "Rinorea mayumbensis, commonly known as the Mayumb\u00e9 Rinorea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton plants. The plant is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and showy, five-petaled flowers that typically range in color from white to pink. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the understory of dense forest canopies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rinorea mayumbensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
