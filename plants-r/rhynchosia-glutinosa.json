    "intro": "Rhynchosia glutinosa, commonly known as sticky beans, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is characterized by its sticky, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Rhynchosia glutinosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
