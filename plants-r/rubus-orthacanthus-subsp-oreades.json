    "intro": "Rubus orthacanthus subsp. oreades, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often too tart for widespread consumption. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in alpine ecosystems."
