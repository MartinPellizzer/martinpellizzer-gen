    "intro": "Robinia amoena, commonly known as the yellow false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters during the spring, which are typically pale yellow to cream in color. Its seeds are enclosed in woody pods that split open to release the seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Robinia amoena is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
