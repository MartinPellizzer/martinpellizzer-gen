    "intro": "Rhododendron patulum, commonly known as the slender rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Myanmar. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers. The leaves are typically dark green, leathery, and arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant floral display, which ranges from pink to red, depending on the variety."
