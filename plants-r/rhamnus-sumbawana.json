    "intro": "Rhamnus sumbawana, commonly known as the Sumbawa buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the island of Sumbawa in Indonesia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in forested areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
