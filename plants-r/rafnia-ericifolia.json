    "intro": "Rafnia ericifolia, commonly known as the heath fern, is a perennial plant native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Dryopteridaceae and is characterized by its delicate, finely divided fronds that resemble those of a fern. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and heathlands. Rafnia ericifolia has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are clustered on the underside of the fronds, a typical feature of ferns."
