    "intro": "Rosa beggeriana var. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
