    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellaris f. plenus, commonly known as the full-flowered meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with a distinctive central tuft of stamens, which are more prominent than in the typical species. The plant has finely divided, palmate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a vibrant, early-flowering addition to their landscape."
