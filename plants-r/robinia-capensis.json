    "intro": "Robinia capensis, commonly known as the weeping protea, is a striking evergreen shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its long, drooping branches that give it a distinctive, almost weeping appearance. The plant produces large, showy white or pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a lush backdrop to the floral display. Robinia capensis is well-suited to coastal climates and requires well-drained soil to thrive."
