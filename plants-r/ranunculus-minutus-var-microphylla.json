    "intro": "Ranunculus minutus var. microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves are palmately divided into fine, feathery lobes, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its small size and striking appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine displays."
