    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sublongimammus, commonly known as the long-horned buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals and prominent, elongated sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges, and it produces achenes as its fruit. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
