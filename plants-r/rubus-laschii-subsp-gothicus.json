It is characterized by its small, prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the summer, which are followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in harsh environments, often growing on rocky slopes and tundra. Its botanical features reflect adaptations to cold climates and poor soil conditions."
