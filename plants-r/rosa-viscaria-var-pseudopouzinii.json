    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pseudopouzinii, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a shrub-like species native to Central Asia. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly hairy texture. This variety is well adapted to rocky and arid environments, making it a hardy choice for xeriscaping and rock gardens."
