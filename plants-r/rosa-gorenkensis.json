    "intro": "Rosa gorenkensis, commonly known as the Gorenko rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, semi-double pink to red flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its leaves are dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Rosa gorenkensis is well-suited to well-drained, loamy soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
