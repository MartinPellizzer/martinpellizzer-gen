    "intro": "Rhynchosia elegans, commonly known as the elegant snout bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features trifoliate leaves with heart-shaped leaflets and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive snout-like spur. The plant bears pods that contain several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. Rhynchosia elegans thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its botanical characteristics make it both ornamental and ecologically significant in its native range."
