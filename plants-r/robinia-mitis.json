    "intro": "Robinia mitis, commonly known as the silky acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers, and its wood is lightweight and has been historically used for various purposes. Robinia mitis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
