    "intro": "Rubus discolor subsp. moestus, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three to five leaflets, often with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and fruit size, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
