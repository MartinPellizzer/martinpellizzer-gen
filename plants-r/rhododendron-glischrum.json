    "intro": "Rhododendron glischrum, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in the Himalayas and China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or alpine environments. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often glandular and emit a strong, sometimes unpleasant odor. Its flowers are usually pink or red, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron glischrum is adapted to cold climates and is often found in subalpine or alpine zones where it thrives in well-drained soils."
