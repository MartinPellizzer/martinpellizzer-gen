    "intro": "Rosa pseudomatssonii, commonly known as the Tibetan rose, is a rare species native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It is often found in rocky habitats and is considered a symbol of resilience in its native region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
