    "intro": "Rubus selleanus, commonly known as the Sellean blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its flowers are white or pale pink and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Rubus selleanus is valued for both its ecological role and its edible fruits."
