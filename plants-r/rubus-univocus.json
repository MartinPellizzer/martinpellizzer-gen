    "intro": "Rubus univocus, commonly known as the single-focus raspberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically edible, though they may vary in flavor and texture compared to more common raspberry varieties. Its botanical features include pinnate leaves with serrated edges and flowers that are usually pink or white. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rubus univocus is considered a rare and specialized species."
