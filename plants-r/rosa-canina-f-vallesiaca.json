    "intro": "Rosa canina f. vallesiaca, commonly known as the Vallesian rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rosa genus. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by bright orange to red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been used in traditional medicine for its astringent properties."
