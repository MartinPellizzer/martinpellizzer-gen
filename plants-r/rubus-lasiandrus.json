    "intro": "Rubus lasiandrus, commonly known as the rough-bracted raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and thrives in dry, rocky habitats. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
