It is characterized by its slender stems and small, pale yellow flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are hairy and serrated. This plant prefers moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. It is a perennial shrub that produces edible berries, though they are generally smaller and less flavorful than those of other Rubus species."
