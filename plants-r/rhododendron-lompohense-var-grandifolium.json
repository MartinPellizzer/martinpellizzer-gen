    "intro": "Rhododendron lompohense var. grandifolium, commonly known as the Lompoh giantleaf rhododendron, is a unique variant native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in cool, moist climates with acidic soil and partial shade. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
