    "intro": "Royena lucida var. whyteana, commonly known as the White's Royalbark, is a unique variant of the Royena lucida species native to specific regions of Australia. It is characterized by its striking, waxy, white or pale green bark that peels in thin, papery layers, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows as a small tree or shrub, with lance-shaped leaves that are usually glossy and dark green. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by edible, red, fleshy fruits that are a food source for various wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically important species."
