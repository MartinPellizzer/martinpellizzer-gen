    "intro": "Rubus discretus, commonly known as the discreet raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant produces white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are usually serrated along the edges. Rubus discretus is adapted to grow in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine environments."
