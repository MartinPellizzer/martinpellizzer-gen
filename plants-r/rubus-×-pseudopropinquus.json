    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudopropinquus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or loganberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus ilduriensis (evergreen blackberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically has thorny stems, compound leaves, and produces aggregate fruits composed of small drupes. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The hybrid is valued for its large, sweet-tart berries, which are used in culinary and commercial applications."
