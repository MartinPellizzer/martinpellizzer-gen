It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces clusters of white to pale yellow flowers, which are followed by red, edible berries. Its leaves are compound, with three to five oval leaflets, and they have a slightly serrated edge. Rubus magniflorus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
