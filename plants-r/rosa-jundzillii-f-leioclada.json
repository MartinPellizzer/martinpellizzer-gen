    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii f. leioclada, commonly known as the white-leaved rock rose, is a unique cultivar of the Rosa jundzillii species. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant features glossy, leathery leaves that are distinctly lighter in color compared to the typical green foliage of other roses. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or container planting. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in temperate climates."
