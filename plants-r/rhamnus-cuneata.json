    "intro": "Rhamnus cuneata, commonly known as the Chinese buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter in color underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by elongated, reddish berries in the fall. Rhamnus cuneata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping due to its hardy nature. It also has historical uses in traditional medicine."
