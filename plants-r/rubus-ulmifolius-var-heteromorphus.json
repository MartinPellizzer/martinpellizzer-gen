    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. heteromorphus, commonly known as the variable bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its variable leaf shapes and sizes. It is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are clusters of small, red drupes that mature in late summer. Its leaves are usually trifoliate or pinnate, with serrated margins, and it has thorny stems that provide structural support. This species is valued for its ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife in its native habitats."
