It is characterized by its dense, spike-like inflorescence composed of small, scale-like flowers. The plant typically grows in wetland environments, such as marshes and pond edges, where it thrives in moist, often saturated soils. Retzia spicata has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are wind-pollinated. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
