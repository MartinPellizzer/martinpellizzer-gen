    "intro": "Rubus parviflorus var. fraserianus, commonly known as Fraser's bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. The plant features thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces edible berries that ripen in early summer. This variety is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil."
