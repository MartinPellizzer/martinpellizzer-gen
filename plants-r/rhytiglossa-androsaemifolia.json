    "intro": "Rhytiglossa androsaemifolia, commonly known as the Androsaemifolia cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of Andros in the Bahamas. It is a member of the Cycadaceae family, characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and large, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. Its foliage is often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss in its arid native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species."
