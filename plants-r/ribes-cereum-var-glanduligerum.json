It is characterized by its glandular, sticky leaves and stems, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
