    "intro": "Rebutia canigueralii subsp. pulchra, commonly known as the \"Coral Cactus,\" is a compact, spineless cactus native to the Canary Islands. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale blue tubercles. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or orange during the spring and summer months. It thrives in full sun and well-draining soil, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Due to its attractive appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and succulent collections."
