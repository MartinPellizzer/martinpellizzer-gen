    "intro": "Rosa quasivenusta, commonly known as the \"almost showy rose,\" is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern South America, particularly in countries like Argentina and Chile. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, with oval-shaped leaflets that are covered in a fine layer of white, waxy hair. Rosa quasivenusta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is valued for its hardiness in cooler climates."
