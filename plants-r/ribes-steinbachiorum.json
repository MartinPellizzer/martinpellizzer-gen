    "intro": "Ribes steinbachiorum, commonly known as the Steinbach gooseberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Grossulariaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its erect, branched stems and clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruit, a small, tart berry, is similar to other gooseberries but is less commonly cultivated. Ribes steinbachiorum plays an important ecological role by providing food for various wildlife species."
