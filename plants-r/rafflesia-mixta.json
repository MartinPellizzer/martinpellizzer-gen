    "intro": "Rafflesia mixta, commonly known as the giant cup, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host plant for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong odor reminiscent of decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. The botanical structure of Rafflesia mixta is simple, with a fleshy, reddish-orange flower that contains numerous petals and a central reproductive structure."
