    "intro": "Rhus sandwicensis, commonly known as \u02bbaha\u02bbula, is a native Hawaiian shrub or small tree belonging to the Anacardiaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnately arranged with oval or lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers followed by red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for native birds and insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and lowland habitats. Due to habitat loss, Rhus sandwicensis is considered endangered and is protected in its native range."
