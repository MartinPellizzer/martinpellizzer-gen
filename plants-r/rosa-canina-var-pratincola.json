    "intro": "Rosa canina var. pratincola, commonly known as the alpine rose or mountain dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by orange-red hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its hardiness, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
