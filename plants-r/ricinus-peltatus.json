    "intro": "Ricinus peltatus, commonly known as the palmate castor oil plant, is a species of flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. Its seeds contain ricin, a toxic protein, making it potentially dangerous if ingested. Despite its toxicity, it is cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in the production of castor oil."
