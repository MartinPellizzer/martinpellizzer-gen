    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 neogradensis, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rorippa amphibia and Rorippa islandica. It is a semi-aquatic plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments such as ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive peppery aroma when crushed. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, and it is known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various water conditions. This species is of interest in botanical studies due to its hybrid nature and ecological versatility."
