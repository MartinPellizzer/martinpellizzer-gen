    "intro": "Rubus grandipaniculatus, commonly known as the large-panicle blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark red to black drupelets, which are typically harvested in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
