    "intro": "Rosa pendulina f. nemorum, commonly known as the creeping rose or swamp rose, is a botanical variant of the shrub rose species. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often trail along the ground or form dense mats. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. This form is particularly adapted to wetlands and woodland areas, making it a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
