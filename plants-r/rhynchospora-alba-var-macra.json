    "intro": "Rhynchospora alba var. macra, commonly known as the white tussock sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marsh habitats in eastern North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and three-ranked leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to form dense colonies, contributing to soil stabilization in wetland environments. It is often found in association with other wetland plants, playing a role in maintaining ecological balance in these sensitive ecosystems."
