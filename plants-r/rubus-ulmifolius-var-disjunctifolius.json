    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. disjunctifolius, commonly known as the Disjunct-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive disjunct (broken) leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, sunny to partially shaded locations. This variant is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
