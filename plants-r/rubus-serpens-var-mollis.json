    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-fruited blackberry shrub, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and dense, thorny stems that often root at the nodes. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptical in shape, with a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves, followed by dark purple to black berries. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
