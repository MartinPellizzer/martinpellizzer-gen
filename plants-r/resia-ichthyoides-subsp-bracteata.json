    "intro": "Resia ichthyoides subsp. bracteata, commonly known as the bracteate resia, is a succulent plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its fleshy, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in a fine layer of white wax. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, scale-like structures, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions."
