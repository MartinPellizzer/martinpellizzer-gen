    "intro": "Rhachidosorus mesosorus, commonly known as the small-veined water fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Blechnaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with creeping underground stems that help it spread across water surfaces. Its leaves are bipinnate, with short, stout pinnae and a distinctive, narrow sori arrangement. Rhachidosorus mesosorus is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
