    "intro": "Rhododendron rubropilosum, commonly known as the red-hairy rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage covered in fine, rusty-red hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It prefers cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions. Rhododendron rubropilosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
