    "intro": "Rubus nemoralis, commonly known as bramble or blackberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually black when ripe and contain a sweet, juicy pulp. Rubus nemoralis thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for birds and insects, and its roots help prevent soil erosion."
