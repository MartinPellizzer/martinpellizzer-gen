    "intro": "Rhododendron rarosquameum, commonly known as the rare scale-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The leaves are typically small, leathery, and covered with a distinctive scale-like texture. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires a cool, humid climate. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
