It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and yellow. The plant features a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to thrive in moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are elongated and often covered in fine hairs, while the roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in rocky or forest substrates. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
