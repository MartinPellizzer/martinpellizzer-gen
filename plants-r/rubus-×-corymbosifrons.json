    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 corymbosifrons, commonly known as the blackberry-loganberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The plant produces large, dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its parent species. Its leaves are compound, with three to five oval leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental value and fruit production in suitable climates."
