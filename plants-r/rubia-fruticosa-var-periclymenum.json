    "intro": "Rubia fruticosa var. periclymenum, commonly known as woodruff, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its fragrant, small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a distinctive, slightly aromatic scent. Woodruff is often used in perfumery and as a flavoring agent due to its pleasant aroma."
