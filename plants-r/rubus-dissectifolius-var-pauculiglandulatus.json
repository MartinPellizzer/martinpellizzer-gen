    "intro": "Rubus dissectifolius var. pauculiglandulatus, commonly known as the glandular-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its finely dissected leaves with fewer glandular dots compared to other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it distinct within the Rubus genus, particularly in its leaf morphology and gland distribution."
