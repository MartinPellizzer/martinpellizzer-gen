    "intro": "Rhododendron villosum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and southern China. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
