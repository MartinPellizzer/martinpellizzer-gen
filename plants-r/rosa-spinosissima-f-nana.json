    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima f. nana, commonly known as the dwarf spinose rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub that exhibits the characteristic thorny stems of its parent species. This cultivar is prized for its dense, rounded growth habit and its ability to form a thick, matted ground cover. The foliage is typically dark green and glossy, with small, leathery leaves that are arranged in an alternate pattern. It produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Due to its hardy nature, it is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover in well-drained soils."
