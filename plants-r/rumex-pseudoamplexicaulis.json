    "intro": "Rumex pseudoamplexicaulis, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of large, broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with dense clusters of small, greenish flowers. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though it is more commonly regarded as a weed in agricultural settings."
