    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. pilinaeva, commonly known as the blue glaucous rose, is a rare and ornamental variant of the Rosa glauca species. It is characterized by its striking blue-gray foliage and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its unique coloration makes it a sought-after specimen in botanical gardens and specialized collections. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
