    "intro": "Rhododendron oreogenum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils. It has a compact growth habit and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy species suited to alpine conditions. The leaves are leathery and dark green, providing year-round visual interest in its natural habitat."
