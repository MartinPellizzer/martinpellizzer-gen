    "intro": "Rhamnus xizangensis, commonly known as the Yunnan buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southwestern China. It belongs to the family Rutaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations ranging from 2,000 to 4,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a rare and valuable species in its native habitat."
