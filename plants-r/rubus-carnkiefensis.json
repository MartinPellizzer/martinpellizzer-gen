    "intro": "Rubus carnkiefensis, commonly known as the Kankie raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the wetlands of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are less commonly consumed by humans compared to other raspberry species. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in marshy areas and along the edges of ponds. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
