    "intro": "Roegneria breviglumis, commonly known as the short-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender,\u4e1b\u751f growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 10 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in dry, open habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes, often forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Roegneria breviglumis is valued for its hardiness and ability to stabilize soils in arid environments."
