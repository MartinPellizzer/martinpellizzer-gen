    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis var. sublanatus, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and local wildlife."
