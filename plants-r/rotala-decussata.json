    "intro": "Rotala decussata, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy leaves that are arranged in a rosette pattern, often with a white or pale underside. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white, and it thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. Rotala decussata is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide habitat for aquatic life. However, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
