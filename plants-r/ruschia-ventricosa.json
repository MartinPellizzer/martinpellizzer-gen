    "intro": "Ruschia ventricosa, commonly known as the fat plant or moon cactus, is a succulent native to South Africa. It features thick, fleshy stems that store water, allowing it to thrive in arid conditions. The plant has small, often inconspicuous flowers that bloom in shades of yellow or orange. Its leaves are typically rounded and may have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Ruschia ventricosa is well-suited for indoor cultivation due to its low maintenance requirements."
