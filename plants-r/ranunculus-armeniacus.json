    "intro": "Ranunculus armeniacus, commonly known as Armenian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Turkey. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with yellow centers and white or pale yellow petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmate leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive, fern-like appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in woodland or alpine habitats. Ranunculus armeniacus is valued in horticulture for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, ephemeral blooms."
