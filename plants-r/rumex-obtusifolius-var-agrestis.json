    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius var. agrestis, commonly known as the rough dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Its robust growth and adaptability make it a common weed in agricultural and natural settings."
