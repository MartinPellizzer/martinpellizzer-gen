    "intro": "Rorippa pyrenaica subsp. lippizensis, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams and springs, thriving in cool, temperate climates. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed aquatic habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
