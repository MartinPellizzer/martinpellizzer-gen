    "intro": "Rubus sulcatus f. canescens, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its distinctive hairy foliage and stems. This form exhibits a more robust growth habit compared to the typical Rubus sulcatus, with a dense covering of fine, white hairs across its surface. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its unique appearance and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes."
