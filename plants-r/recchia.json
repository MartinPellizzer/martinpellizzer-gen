These plants are typically herbaceous and often have a distinctive yellow or orange coloration in their flowers. They are characterized by their simple, alternate leaves and a short, stout stem. Recchia species are often found in moist environments such as wet meadows and stream banks. The flowers are usually small and clustered, producing a showy appearance that attracts pollinators."
