    "intro": "Rottboellia angolensis, commonly known as the African dog's-tail, is a perennial grass native to Africa. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, pale green blades with a rough texture. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that are often mistaken for grasses or sedges. It thrives in disturbed soils and is commonly found in agricultural fields and along roadsides. Rottboellia angolensis is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
