    "intro": "Ripogonum album var. leptostachya, commonly known as the silverleaf morning glory, is a climbing vine native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of small, trumpet-shaped white flowers that bloom in the morning, giving it its common name. Its stems are slender and twining, allowing it to climb and trail along supports. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate foliage and flowering habit."
