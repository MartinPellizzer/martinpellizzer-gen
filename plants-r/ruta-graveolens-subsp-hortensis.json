    "intro": "Ruta graveolens subsp. hortensis, commonly known as garden rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dark green, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, dry fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, often used in traditional medicine and as a ornamental plant. Its toxic properties require careful handling, as all parts of the plant contain compounds that can be harmful if ingested."
