    "intro": "Rhexia brevifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf bluetail, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Geraniaceae and is characterized by its delicate, blue-violet flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain the seeds. Rhexia brevifolia is a herbaceous perennial that plays a role in supporting local pollinators and maintaining ecological balance in its habitat."
