It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
