    "intro": "Rubus banghamii, commonly known as Bangham's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in the summer months. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. The plant is of interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and potential ecological significance in its native habitat."
