    "intro": "Rhamnus lycioides f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in the spring. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. Its hairy, velvety texture gives it its common name and distinguishes it from other members of the Rhamnus genus."
