    "intro": "Rosa quasicollinalis, commonly known as the nearly collinear rose, is a rare and less-studied species within the Rosa genus. It is characterized by its unique growth pattern, where the stems and branches appear to align closely, giving it its common name. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that provide a textured appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa quasicollinalis is considered a botanical curiosity and is of interest to horticulturists and botanists alike."
