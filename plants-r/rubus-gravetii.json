    "intro": "Rubus gravetii, commonly known as the desert raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls. The plant produces small, edible berries that are yellowish to orange in color, which are often used in local cuisines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Rubus gravetii plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its native habitat."
