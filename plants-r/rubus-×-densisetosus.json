    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 densisetosus, commonly known as the dense-hairy blackberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its dense, bristly hairs covering its stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically firm and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
