    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. macrostachys, commonly known as the rough raspberry or bramble raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in a dense layer of stiff, glandular hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red, raspberry-like drupes that ripen in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils. This variant is notable for its robust growth habit and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value or as a source of edible berries."
