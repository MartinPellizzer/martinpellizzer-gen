It is characterized by its bright yellow, shield-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a more rugged appearance compared to other ranunculus species. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
