    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 utile, commonly known as the hybrid gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the genus Ribes in the family Grossulariaceae. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ribes hirtellum (boysenberry) and Ribes aureum (golden gooseberry), resulting in a plant with a unique combination of traits. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically red or yellow in color, often used in jams and preserves. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value comes from its attractive foliage and showy flowers, making it a popular choice for gardens and landscapes."
