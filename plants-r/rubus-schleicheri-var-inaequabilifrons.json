    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. inaequabilifrons, commonly known as the unequal-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, with varying sizes and shapes on opposite sides of the same stem. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its growth habit includes thorny stems and dense foliage, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
