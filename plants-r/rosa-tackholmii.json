    "intro": "Rosa tackholmii, commonly known as the Tackholm rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a delicate and somewhat elusive species in horticulture."
