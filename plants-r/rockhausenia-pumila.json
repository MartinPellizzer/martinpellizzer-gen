    "intro": "Rockhausenia pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rockhausenia, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with dense clusters of narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific environmental requirements, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
