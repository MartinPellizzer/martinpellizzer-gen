    "intro": "Rhododendron brevicaudatum, commonly known as the broad-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments at high elevations, often in mountain forests. Its leaves are thick and leathery, with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture in its native habitat. The flowers range in color from white to pink and are pollinated primarily by bees and other nectar-feeding insects."
