    "intro": "Rosa communis var. caballicensis, commonly known as the Caballic Rose, is a rare and ornamental variety of rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its deep pink, semi-double flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
