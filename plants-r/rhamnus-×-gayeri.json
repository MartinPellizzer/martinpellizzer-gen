    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 gayeri, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a hybrid shrub that belongs to the family Rhamnaceae. It is native to southern Europe and is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain regions."
