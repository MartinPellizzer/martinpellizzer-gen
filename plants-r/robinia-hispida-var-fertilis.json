    "intro": "Robinia hispida var. fertilis, commonly known as the hairy locust or false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often covered in fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in early summer, followed by elongated, woody pods that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control."
