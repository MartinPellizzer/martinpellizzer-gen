It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in alpine or subalpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
