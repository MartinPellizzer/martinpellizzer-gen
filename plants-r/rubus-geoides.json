    "intro": "Rubus geoides, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 meter, with arching stems covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple to black berries in the fall. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets that have serrated edges. Rubus geoides is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and moist, well-drained soils."
