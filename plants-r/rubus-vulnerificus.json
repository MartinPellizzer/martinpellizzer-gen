    "intro": "Rubus vulnerificus, commonly known as the poison ivy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves with three leaflets, often with a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy drupe that ripens in the fall. However, it is considered toxic due to the presence of urushiol, which can cause severe skin irritation in humans."
