    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 acetoselliformis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetcula (yellow sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purplish underside, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in morphology and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
