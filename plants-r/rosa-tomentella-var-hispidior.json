    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. hispidior, commonly known as the hispid thimbleberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
