    "intro": "Rubus corchorifolius subsp. typicus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native range."
