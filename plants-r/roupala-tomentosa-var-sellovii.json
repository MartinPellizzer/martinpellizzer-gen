    "intro": "Roupala tomentosa var. sellovii, commonly known as the Sello's wooly roupala, is a shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (hairy) foliage, which provides a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and sandy habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
