    "intro": "Rhododendron degronianum var. kyomaruense, commonly known as the Kyomaru rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slight waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern."
