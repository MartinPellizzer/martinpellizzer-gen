    "intro": "Rubus eflagellaris, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to the western United States, characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark berries. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. Its fruit is typically smaller and more acidic compared to other blackberry species. It is often found in disturbed soils and along stream banks, contributing to ecological succession in these habitats."
