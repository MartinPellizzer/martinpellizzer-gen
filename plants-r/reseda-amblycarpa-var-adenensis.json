    "intro": "Reseda amblycarpa var. adenensis, commonly known as the desert flax, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of Australia. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, linear leaves and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces capsule fruits containing numerous seeds, which are adapted for dispersal by wind. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is well-suited to harsh, dry environments. Its fibrous stems and leaves have been used traditionally by Indigenous Australians for various purposes."
