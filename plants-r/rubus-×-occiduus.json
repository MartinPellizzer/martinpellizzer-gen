    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 occiduus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many brambles. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are clusters of small drupes that develop from the flowering stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions."
