    "intro": "Rubus triflorus f. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered triflorous raspberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its diminutive, clustered flowers and thorny stems typical of many Rubus species. The leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval to lanceolate in shape. This form is often found in temperate regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a subspecies that showcases the morphological diversity within the Rubus genus."
