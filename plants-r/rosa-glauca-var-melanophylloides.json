    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. melanophylloides, commonly known as the dark-leaved dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its deep green, almost black foliage, which contrasts strikingly with its pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, and produces fragrant, single or semi-double blooms. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts interested in rare flora."
