    "intro": "Rosa canina var. senticosa, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems that exude a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. Its hips, or fruit, are typically red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. This variety is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
