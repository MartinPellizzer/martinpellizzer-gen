    "intro": "Rhododendron rosmarinifolium var. speciosum, commonly known as the sweetbox or fragrant boxwood, is a slow-growing evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, dark green, lance-shaped leaves with a pleasant, spicy aroma, especially when crushed. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in early spring, which are clustered in rounded inflorescences. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens or as a foundation plant. Its compact growth habit and ornamental foliage make it a valuable addition to ornamental horticulture."
