    "intro": "Ruschia aspera, commonly known as the roughleaf Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features compact, low-growing stems covered in dense, woolly hair, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The leaves are typically blue-gray or silver, with a rough, sandpaper-like texture. It produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or orange during the warmer months. This plant is well-suited for rock gardens and xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal."
