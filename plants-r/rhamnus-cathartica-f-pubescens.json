It possesses small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"pubescent\" appearance. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. Its bark is typically smooth and may have a reddish or grayish hue, depending on the age of the plant. This variety is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
