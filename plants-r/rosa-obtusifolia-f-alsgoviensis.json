    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. alsgoviensis, commonly known as the Alsgovian rose, is a rare botanical variant of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant produces small, red hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal environments. This subspecies is of particular interest to botanists due to its limited distribution and unique morphological traits."
