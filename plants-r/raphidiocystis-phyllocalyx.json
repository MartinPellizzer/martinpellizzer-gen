    "intro": "Raphidiocystis phyllocalyx, commonly known as the golden star fern, is a rare and delicate epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense fronds that form a star-like appearance. The plant's rhizomes are covered in small, yellowish cysts, which are a distinguishing feature. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high air humidity and indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
