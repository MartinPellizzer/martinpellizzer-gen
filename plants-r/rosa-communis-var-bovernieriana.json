    "intro": "Rosa communis var. bovernieriana, commonly known as the Bovenier's rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has dark green, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy perennial suitable for garden cultivation. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its vibrant blooms and historical use in perfumery and medicine."
