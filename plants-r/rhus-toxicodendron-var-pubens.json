    "intro": "Rhus toxicodendron var. pubens, commonly known as the stinkbush or smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. The species is also known for its allelopathic properties, where it can inhibit the growth of nearby plants through the release of certain chemicals."
