    "intro": "Rumex alveolatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a prominent central vein and a waxy upper surface. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the summer months, which are followed by reddish-brown, three-lobed fruits. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
