    "intro": "Relhania nordenstamii, commonly known as the Nordenstam's relhania, is a rare evergreen shrub native to the rainforests of Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a glossy dark green surface. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of dense tropical forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
