It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely serrated, dark green leaves and produces red-orange hips in the fall. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy in temperate climates.
