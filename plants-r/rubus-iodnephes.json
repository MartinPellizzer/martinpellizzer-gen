    "intro": "Rubus iodnephes, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found near the shoreline. Due to its adaptability to salty air and coastal conditions, it plays an important role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
