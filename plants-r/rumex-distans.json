    "intro": "Rumex distans, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a wavy margin and a distinctive reddish or purple stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by triangular, edible fruits. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. Rumex distans is known for its medicinal properties and has been used traditionally for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
