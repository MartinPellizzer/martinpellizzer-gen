It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its vibrant red bracts that surround small, tubular flowers, which are often visited by hummingbirds and other pollinators. Its foliage consists of opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy texture and dark green coloration. Retiniphyllum erythranthum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to shaded garden spaces."
