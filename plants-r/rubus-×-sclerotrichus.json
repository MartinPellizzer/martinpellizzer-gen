    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 sclerotrichus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along fence rows. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not managed properly."
