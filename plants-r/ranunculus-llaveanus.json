    "intro": "Ranunculus llaveanus, commonly known as the Lave's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to South America, particularly found in Ecuador and Peru. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features palmately divided leaves and produces flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in montane forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
