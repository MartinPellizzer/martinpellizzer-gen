    "intro": "Rubus conchyliatus, commonly known as the sea raspberry, is a shrub native to coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, red, raspberry-like fruits that are edible and often used in jams and preserves. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in saline and well-drained environments. Rubus conchyliatus plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing coastal dunes."
