    "intro": "Roegneria multiculmis var. pubiflora, commonly known as the pubiflora wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, blue-green blades that are often covered with fine hairs. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed florets, which are typically pale green to golden in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates, making it a hardy ornamental and forage grass. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and low-maintenance landscaping."
