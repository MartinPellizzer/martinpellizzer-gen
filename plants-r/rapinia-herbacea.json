    "intro": "Rapinia herbacea, commonly known as slender rapinia, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically features small, lance-shaped leaves that are densely packed along its stems. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized flora species."
