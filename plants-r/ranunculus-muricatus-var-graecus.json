    "intro": "Ranunculus muricatus var. graecus, commonly known as the Greek buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive central blotch, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
