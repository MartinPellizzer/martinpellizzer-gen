    "intro": "Restrepia escobariana, commonly known as the Escobaria orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous structure and produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink. The plant typically blooms during the cooler months, often in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires bright but indirect light for optimal growth. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
