    "intro": "Racosperma cuthbertsonii subsp. lineare, commonly known as the slender wattle, is a shrub native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often drooping branches and small, yellow flowers that appear in spikes. The plant has finely divided, linear leaves that give it a grass-like appearance, and it is typically found in coastal and sandy soils. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes many leguminous plants, and it plays a role in nitrogen fixation in its habitat. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
