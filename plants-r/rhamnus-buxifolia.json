    "intro": "Rhamnus buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and small, glossy, dark green leaves that resemble those of boxwood. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in natural habitats."
