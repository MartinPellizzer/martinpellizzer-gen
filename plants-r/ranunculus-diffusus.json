    "intro": "Ranunculus diffusus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, often hairy stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with deeply lobed segments, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Ranunculus diffusus is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
