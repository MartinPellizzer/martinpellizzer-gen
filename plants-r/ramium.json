    "intro": "Ramium, commonly known as red clover, is a flowering plant belonging to the legume family, Fabaceae. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three oval-shaped leaflets, and its pink or purple flower heads that resemble a cluster of small blossoms. The plant is native to Europe and Asia but has been widely naturalized in North America. Ramium is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, making it an important plant in agricultural and ecological contexts. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and along roadsides."
