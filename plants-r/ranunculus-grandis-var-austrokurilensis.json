    "intro": "Ranunculus grandis var. austrokurilensis, commonly known as the Kuril buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the islands of the Kuril archipelago. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically arranged in a cup-like shape. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found growing in coastal meadows and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
