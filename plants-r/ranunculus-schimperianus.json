    "intro": "Ranunculus schimperianus, commonly known as the Schimper's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or alpine habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
