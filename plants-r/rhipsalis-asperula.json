    "intro": "Rhipsalis asperula, commonly known as the rough rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is a climbing plant with a unique appearance, featuring long, slender stems covered in short, stiff spines. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in greenhouses."
