    "intro": "Rapanea denticulata, commonly known as the toothed evergreen, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are often serrated or toothed, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Rapanea denticulata is valued for its ornamental appeal and has traditional uses in local medicine."
