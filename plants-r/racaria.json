    "intro": "Racaria, commonly known as the sea holly, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its striking, spiky flower heads that resemble small, colorful sea urchins. These plants are native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean and the eastern Mediterranean, where they thrive in saline and sandy soils. Racaria species typically have narrow, linear leaves and produce small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical capitula. They are often cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens and coastal landscapes."
