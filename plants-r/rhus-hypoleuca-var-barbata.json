It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into 5 to 9 serrated leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its ornamental value and ecological importance make it a notable species in native plant gardens."
