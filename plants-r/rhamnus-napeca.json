    "intro": "Rhamnus napeca, commonly known as the Napeca buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in temperate to subtropical climates. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its bark is smooth and grayish-brown. Rhamnus napeca is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological significance in its native habitat."
