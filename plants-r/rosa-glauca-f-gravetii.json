    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. gravetii, commonly known as the Glacier rose, is a rare and cold-hardy variant of the glaucous rose. It is characterized by its pale blue to white flowers and silver-gray foliage, which provide a striking visual contrast. This plant thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often found in rocky soils at high elevations. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a sought-after addition to specialized gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered endangered and requires careful conservation efforts."
