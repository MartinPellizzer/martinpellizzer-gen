    "intro": "Rubus lobulatus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, developing from clusters of tiny drupes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually serrated along the edges. This species is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and along stream banks."
