    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. brevinodis, commonly known as the short-stalked castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its reduced peduncles. It is an annual herbaceous plant native to tropical regions, featuring large, palmate leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. The plant produces unique spiny capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Due to its toxic properties, it requires careful handling and is not recommended for indoor cultivation."
