It is characterized by its reduced or absent glandular hairs on the fruit, distinguishing it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, oval-shaped fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
