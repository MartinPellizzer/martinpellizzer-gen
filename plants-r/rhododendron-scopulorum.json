    "intro": "Rhododendron scopulorum, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It typically grows in rocky or forested habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features dense, leathery leaves and produces clusters of bell-shaped, brightly colored flowers in shades of pink, red, or white. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic soil and partial shade. Rhododendron scopulorum is also notable for its ecological role in stabilizing soil in its native mountainous environments."
