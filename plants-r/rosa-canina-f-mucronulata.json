It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in the spring. The plant produces red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its natural habitat, making it a resilient and hardy species."
