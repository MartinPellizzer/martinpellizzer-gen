    "intro": "Rhynchopyle impolita, commonly known as the rough rhynchopyle, is a flowering plant native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy stems and broad leaves. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Rhynchopyle impolita is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and swampy areas."
