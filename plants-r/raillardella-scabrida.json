It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. Its small yellow flowers bloom in late summer, and the plant typically grows in dry, open habitats. Raillardella scabrida is often found in grasslands and rocky areas, where it thrives in full sun."
