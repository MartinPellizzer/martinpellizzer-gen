    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. martrinsiana, commonly known as the Matrinsiana rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing a dense foliage structure. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. It is well-suited for coastal climates due to its tolerance of salt spray and well-drained soils. Its slow growth and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for garden borders and containers."
