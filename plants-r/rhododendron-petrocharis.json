    "intro": "Rhododendron petrocharis, commonly known as the rock rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. It is often found growing on rocky slopes and in forest understories. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
