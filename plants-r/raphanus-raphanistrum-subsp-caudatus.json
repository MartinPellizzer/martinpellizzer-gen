    "intro": "Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. caudatus, commonly known as the hairy root rocket, is a wild brassica species native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branching stems and bright green, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which are followed by slender, beak-like seed pods. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery, radish-like flavor, making it a potential candidate for cultivation. The species is also noted for its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
