The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are broad and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its natural habitat. Rhodospatha surinamensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is cultivated in greenhouses and tropical gardens for its vibrant floral display."
