    "intro": "Rosa pustulosa, commonly known as the pustular rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers with numerous stamens, typical of the rose family. Its fruit is a red, hairy rose hip, which contains the seeds. Rosa pustulosa is often found in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight."
