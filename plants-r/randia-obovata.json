It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its opposite, ovate to obovate leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pink in color. Randia obovata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens and as a houseplant in some regions."
