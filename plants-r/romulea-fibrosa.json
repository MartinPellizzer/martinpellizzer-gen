    "intro": "Romulea fibrosa, commonly known as the fibrous broomrape, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Orchidaceae, although it is not a true orchid. The plant is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll and its dependence on host plants for nutrients, as it is a parasitic species. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange and are arranged in dense, racemose inflorescences. Romulea fibrosa thrives in dry, rocky habitats and is often found in grassland ecosystems."
