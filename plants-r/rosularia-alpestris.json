    "intro": "Rosularia alpestris, commonly known as the alpine rose or alpine rosularia, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rosette-like growth habit and produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink or white. The plant is adapted to cold climates and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Rosularia alpestris is often found in alpine meadows and slopes at high elevations. Its foliage is typically covered in a dense layer of fine, hairy hairs, which help protect it from harsh environmental conditions."
