    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. mutata, commonly known as the blue rose, is a variant of the Rosa glauca species, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This plant is characterized by its striking blue-pink flowers, which are a result of a unique genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The leaves are typically gray-green, with a fuzzy texture, and the stems are covered in thorns. It is a compact shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its rarity and aesthetic appeal, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical research."
