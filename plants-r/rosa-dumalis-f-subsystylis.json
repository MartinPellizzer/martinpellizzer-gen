    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. subsystylis, commonly known as the subsystylis form of the alpine rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its unique floral structure. This form exhibits a distinct subsystylis trait, which refers to the reduced length of the stamens compared to the standard Rosa dumalis. It is typically found in alpine or subalpine regions, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a representative of the diverse morphological variations within the Rosa genus."
