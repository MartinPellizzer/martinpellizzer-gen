    "intro": "Romulea flava, commonly known as the yellow romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces a bulbous stem that stores nutrients, allowing it to survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often forming a rosette at the base. Romulea flava is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant color and unique floral structure."
