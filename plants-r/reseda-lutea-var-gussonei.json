    "intro": "Reseda lutea var. gussonei, commonly known as the Italian wallflower, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, clustered yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, oblong seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and disturbed soils. It thrives in full sun and is often found in coastal areas and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a hardy, drought-tolerant species suitable for Mediterranean climates."
