    "intro": "Rhynchosia aureovillosa, commonly known as the golden hairy bean, is a leguminous plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its hairy, yellowish stems and trifoliate leaves with a distinctive auriculate base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated pods containing several oval seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for nitrogen fixation, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and agricultural settings."
