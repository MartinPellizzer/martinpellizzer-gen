    "intro": "Rudbeckia serotina f. homochroma, commonly known as the late yellow coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, hairy stems that bear large, showy yellow ray flowers surrounding a central disk of dark brown to black tubular flowers. The leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and often have a rough texture with a slightly hairy surface. This variety is distinguished by its uniformly yellow flowers, as opposed to the typical greenish or brownish hues of the species. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils in gardens and natural habitats."
