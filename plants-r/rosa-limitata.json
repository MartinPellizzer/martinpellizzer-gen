    "intro": "Rosa limitata, commonly known as the restricted rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in parts of Kazakhstan and China. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it produces small, red berries that ripen in the autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa limitata is considered a rare and endangered species."
