    "intro": "Rhyticarpus rugosus, commonly known as the rough-barked apple, is a small to medium-sized tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that gives it its common name. The leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a rough texture. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by edible, fleshy fruits that are typically yellow or red. It is often found in coastal and dry sclerophyll forests, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
