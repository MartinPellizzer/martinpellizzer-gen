    "intro": "Rathbunia beneckei, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a species of flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in clusters, and its heartwood is highly valued for its fragrance and durability. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and pale in color. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, Rathbunia beneckei is considered a threatened species in its native range."
