It is characterized by its dense, woolly hairs covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The botanical features of this variety make it both ornamental and useful in ecological settings."
