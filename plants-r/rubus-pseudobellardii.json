    "intro": "Rubus pseudobellardii, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to western North America, particularly found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and stream sides. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, prickly hairs. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
