    "intro": "Rhodophiala uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower orchid, is a rare and striking plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its unique, solitary bloom that often stands tall above its foliage. The plant typically grows in rocky or mountainous habitats, where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodophiala uniflora is considered a vulnerable species in its natural range."
