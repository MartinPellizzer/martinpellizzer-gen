    "intro": "Rapuntium volubile, commonly known as the creeping thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with hairy, lobed leaves that are often covered in spines. The plant produces purple to pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom from late spring to early autumn. Its root system is fibrous and can spread extensively, making it an aggressive weed in agricultural and natural settings. It is adapted to a variety of soil types but thrives in well-drained, sunny conditions."
