    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata var. liukiuensis, commonly known as the Liukiu rosebay, is a shrub native to Japan and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and prefers well-drained soil in full sun. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for hedges or ornamental planting in gardens. The leaves are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its showy floral display."
