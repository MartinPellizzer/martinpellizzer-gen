    "intro": "Radicula columbiae, commonly known as the Columbia radicula, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its small, white or pale pink flowers and slender, grass-like foliage. This plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or along stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and shallow, allowing it to anchor in loose, organic soil. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Radicula columbiae is considered a vulnerable species."
