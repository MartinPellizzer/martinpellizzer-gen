    "intro": "Rhodax hymettius, commonly known as the Hymettian rhodax, is a flowering plant native to the island of Hymettus in Greece. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, umbellate inflorescence. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils and thrives in sunny, arid conditions. Its small white or greenish flowers are followed by spherical, dry fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodax hymettius is considered a rare and endangered species."
