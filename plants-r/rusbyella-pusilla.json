    "intro": "Rusbyella pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf sunburst lichen, is a small, foliose lichen that thrives in moist, shaded environments. It has a distinctive yellowish-green to pale orange thallus with a granular texture. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae, which provides its primary source of nutrients through photosynthesis. Rusbyella pusilla is often found on tree bark, rocks, and soil in temperate forests. Its slow growth and delicate structure make it a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
