    "intro": "Rhododendron caucasicum var. alboroseum, commonly known as the Caucasian white roseum rhododendron, is a variant of the Caucasian rhododendron native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with dense, leathery foliage. Its leaves are elliptical, dark green, and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its floral display. This variety is prized in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained, acidic soils."
