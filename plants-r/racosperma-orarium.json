    "intro": "Racosperma orarium, commonly known as the black wattle, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family. It is native to eastern Australia and is characterized by its dark, woody stems and compound leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular clusters, followed by pods that contain small, brown seeds. It is often found in coastal and sandy soils, and it plays a role in soil stabilization due to its extensive root system. Racosperma orarium is also valued for its historical use in tanning and as a source of timber."
