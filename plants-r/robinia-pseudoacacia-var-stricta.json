    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. stricta, commonly known as the narrowleaf false acacia, is a variant of the honeylocust tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are typically 5 to 10 inches long, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, flat pods containing several seeds. It has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion and is often used in reforestation projects. This variety is more compact than the standard Robinia pseudoacacia, making it suitable for smaller landscapes."
