It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a deep red or black color. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible but often has a tart flavor, and it is sometimes used in local cuisines."
