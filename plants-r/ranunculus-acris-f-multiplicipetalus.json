    "intro": "Ranunculus acris f. multiplicipetalus, commonly known as the multi-petaled meadow buttercup, is a variant of the meadow buttercup with distinctive floral characteristics. This plant is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically found in meadows and grassy areas. Its flowers are notable for their increased number of petals, giving them a more elaborate and showy appearance compared to the typical form. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and the plant produces a cluster of small, yellow flowers. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in moist, well-drained soils."
