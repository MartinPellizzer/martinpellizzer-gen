    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 adriatica, commonly known as the Adriatic buckthorn, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhamnus cathartica and Rhamnus alnifolia. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its dark green, oval leaves and smooth, reddish-brown bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and riparian habitats. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological and horticultural contexts."
