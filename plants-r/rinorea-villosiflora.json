It is a small shrub characterized by its simple, opposite leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers with five petals, typically in shades of white or pale pink. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, wind-dispersed seeds. Rinorea villosiflora is often found in moist, shaded areas within tropical forests."
