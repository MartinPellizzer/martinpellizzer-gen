    "intro": "Rosa canina var. multiflora, commonly known as the multiflora rose, is a shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, fuzzy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and often used in culinary and medicinal applications. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is adaptable to different climates, making it a hardy ornamental plant. However, its aggressive growth can lead to it becoming invasive in certain regions."
