    "intro": "Ranunculus ondine, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange. The plant has a hairy stem that grows from 10 to 30 centimeters in height, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive wavy edge. Ranunculus ondine thrives in moist soils and is often found near streams, marshes, and ponds. Its botanical name reflects its association with water, as \"ondine\" is a Latin term related to water."
