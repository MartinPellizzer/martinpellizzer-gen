    "intro": "Rosa canina f. semibiserrata, commonly known as the semi-biserrate dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, featuring a combination of serrations that are both doubly and singly toothed. This form exhibits a compact growth habit with thorned stems and produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is typically found in woodland edges and open areas, thriving in well-drained soils. Its botanical interest lies in its unique leaf structure, making it a subject of study in plant morphology and horticultural classification."
