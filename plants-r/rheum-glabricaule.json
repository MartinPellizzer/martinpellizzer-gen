    "intro": "Rheum glabricaule, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glabrous. The plant produces tall, branched stems that bear clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. Its rhizomes are often used in traditional medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory properties. However, unlike edible rhubarb, Rheum glabricaule is not typically cultivated for consumption due to its bitter and potentially toxic nature."
