    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. apricensis, commonly known as the Armenian shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Armenia and Turkey. It features slender, thornless stems and is characterized by its clusters of small, white to pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with ovate to lanceolate leaflets, and its flowers are often borne on the previous year's wood. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance. The species is also noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils."
