    "intro": "Rubus pectinellus var. trilobus, commonly known as the three-lobed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The botanical features of this variety make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf morphology and fruit structure."
