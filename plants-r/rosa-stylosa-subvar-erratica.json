    "intro": "Rosa stylosa subvar. erratica, commonly known as the wandering rose, is a perennial shrub native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and it produces edible, though tart, red berries in the fall. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in traditional medicine."
