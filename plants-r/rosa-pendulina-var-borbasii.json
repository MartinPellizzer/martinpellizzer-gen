    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. borbasii, commonly known as the Borbasii climbing rose, is a vigorous shrub that produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. It is native to the Canary Islands and is characterized by its long, arching stems that can reach up to 6 meters in length. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it suitable for trellises or as a hedge. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ability to climb or trail in garden settings."
