    "intro": "Rubus edanoi, commonly known as the Hawaiian raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisine. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers during the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in native forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
