    "intro": "Rosa beschnauensis, commonly known as the Beschnau rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and prefers sunny to partially shaded conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa beschnauensis is considered a botanically significant and endangered species."
