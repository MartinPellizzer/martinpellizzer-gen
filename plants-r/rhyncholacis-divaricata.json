It is characterized by its distinctive, often variegated leaves that can vary in shape and color depending on environmental conditions. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in tropical rainforests. Its flowers are usually small and clustered, with a unique structure that includes a specialized lip for attracting pollinators. Due to its ornamental value and habitat specificity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
