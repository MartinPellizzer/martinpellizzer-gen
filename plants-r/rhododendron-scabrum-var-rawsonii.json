    "intro": "Rhododendron scabrum var. rawsonii, commonly known as the Rawson's rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, dark green foliage with leathery texture and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during late spring. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a versatile choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance, it is a popular selection among gardeners seeking hardy, decorative shrubs."
