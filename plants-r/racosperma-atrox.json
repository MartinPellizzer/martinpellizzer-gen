    "intro": "Racosperma atrox, commonly known as the black wattle, is a shrub native to eastern Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, yellow flowers. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules. Its bark and leaves have been traditionally used by Indigenous Australians for various purposes, including dyeing and medicinal applications. Racosperma atrox plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, contributing to soil fertility and providing habitat for native wildlife."
