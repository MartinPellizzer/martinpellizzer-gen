    "intro": "Rhamnus teidis, commonly known as the Teidis buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers followed by small, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
