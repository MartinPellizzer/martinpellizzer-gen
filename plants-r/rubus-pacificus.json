    "intro": "Rubus pacificus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands, streambanks, and coastal areas. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and they bloom in the spring. The fruit is edible, though often tart, and is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
