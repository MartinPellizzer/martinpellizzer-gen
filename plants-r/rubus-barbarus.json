    "intro": "Rubus barbarus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry plant, is a species of shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges. The plant produces small white flowers in the spring, which develop into the familiar edible blackberries in late summer. Rubus barbarus thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. Its berries are not only valued for their flavor but also for their nutritional content and use in traditional medicine."
