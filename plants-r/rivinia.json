    "intro": "Rivinia, commonly known as the coastal morning glory, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant blue or purple flowers that bloom in the morning. The plant thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is often found in dune environments. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and covered in fine hairs. Rivinia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
