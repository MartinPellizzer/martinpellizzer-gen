    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 davisianum, commonly known as the Davis rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant is evergreen, with leathery leaves that provide year-round structure in the landscape. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form thickets, offering both visual appeal and habitat for wildlife."
