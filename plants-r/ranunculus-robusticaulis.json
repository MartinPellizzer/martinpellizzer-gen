    "intro": "Ranunculus robusticaulis, commonly known as the robust water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds and streams, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are submerged or floating, and its flowers are usually yellow with five petals. It produces small, greenish fruits that are dispersed by water currents. Ranunculus robusticaulis plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
