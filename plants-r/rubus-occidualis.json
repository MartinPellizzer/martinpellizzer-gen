    "intro": "Rubus occidualis, commonly known as the western blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in a variety of soil types, including clay and loam. Rubus occidualis is often found in open woodlands, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas."
