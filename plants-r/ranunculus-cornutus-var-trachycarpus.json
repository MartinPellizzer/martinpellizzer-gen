    "intro": "Ranunculus cornutus var. trachycarpus, commonly known as the rough-seeded buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its distinctive, rough-textured fruits are dry and contain multiple seeds, aiding in its dispersal. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
