    "intro": "Ranunculus reptans var. strigulosus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features small, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a distinctive hairy texture, and it produces numerous seeds that are dispersed by wind. This variant is often found in the British Isles and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
