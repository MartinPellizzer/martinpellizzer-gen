These plants are characterized by their showy, velvety flowers that come in a variety of colors, including purple, pink, white, and blue. The leaves are typically dark green and velvety to the touch, often forming a rosette pattern. Runyonia species are popular as houseplants due to their ease of care and aesthetic appeal. They thrive in bright, indirect light and require consistent moisture and well-draining soil."
