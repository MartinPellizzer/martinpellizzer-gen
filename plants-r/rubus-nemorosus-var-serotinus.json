    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus var. serotinus, commonly known as the late-flowering bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the rose family (Rosaceae) and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Its flowering period occurs later in the season compared to other Rubus species, hence its common name."
