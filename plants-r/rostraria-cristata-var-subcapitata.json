    "intro": "Rostraria cristata var. subcapitata, commonly known as the hooded orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is characterized by its unique floral structure, featuring a prominent rostellum and a hood-like labellum that sets it apart from other orchid species. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in montane forests, and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Its flowers are usually pale green to yellowish in color, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
