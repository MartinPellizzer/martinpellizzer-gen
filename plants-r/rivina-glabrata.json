    "intro": "Rivina glabrata, commonly known as the silverleaf rivina, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its attractive foliage and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Rivina glabrata is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ability to attract pollinators."
