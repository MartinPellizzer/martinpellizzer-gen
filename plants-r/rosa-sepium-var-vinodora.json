    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. vinodora, commonly known as the Crimson Velvet Rose, is a hybrid rose cultivar characterized by its deep red, velvety petals and strong, fragrant aroma. It is a deciduous shrub that produces large, showy flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant is known for its vigorous growth and ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, though it prefers well-drained, fertile ground. Its foliage is dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. This variety is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively disease-resistant compared to other rose species."
