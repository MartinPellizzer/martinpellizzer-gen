It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
