    "intro": "Rosa urbica var. decalvata, commonly known as the urban rose, is a variant of the common dog\u73ab\u7470 that is adapted to urban environments. It is characterized by its reduced or absent stipules, which is a distinguishing feature from the typical Rosa urbica. The plant typically produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. It thrives in disturbed soils and can often be found growing along sidewalks and in urban waste areas. Due to its resilience, it is considered a weed in many cities but also a symbol of urban biodiversity."
