    "intro": "Rubus gertrudis, commonly known as Gertrud's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species among botanists."
