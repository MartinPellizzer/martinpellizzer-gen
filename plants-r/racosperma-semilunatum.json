    "intro": "Racosperma semilunatum, commonly known as the moon's eye or half-moon acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its distinctive, pale green, elongated leaves that resemble half-moons, hence its common name. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by flat, leathery pods containing seeds. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often found in coastal and inland regions. Racosperma semilunatum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
