    "intro": "Ranunculus nubigenus f. subintegrus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, bright yellow petals and a hairy stem that helps it withstand cold temperatures. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows where it can receive sufficient sunlight. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which aid in reducing water loss. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a vulnerable species and is often protected in conservation areas."
