    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. punicans, commonly known as the crimson or bloodleaf castor, is a cultivar of the castor oil plant. It is characterized by its striking, deeply lobed leaves that display a vibrant red to maroon coloration, especially when mature. The plant is a tropical perennial that thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil. Its leaves are not only ornamental but also contain toxic compounds, making it potentially hazardous to humans and animals. Despite its beauty, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value rather than its oil-producing capabilities."
