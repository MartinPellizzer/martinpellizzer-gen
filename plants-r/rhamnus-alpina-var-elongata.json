    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. elongata, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, adapting to the harsh, high-altitude environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds and some mammals. It thrives in rocky soils and has a compact growth habit, making it well-suited for alpine ecosystems. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary adaptation to cold, nutrient-poor conditions."
