    "intro": "Rosa evanida, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a species of flowering plant native to South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its botanical name, Rosa evanida, reflects its tendency to be rare or difficult to find in the wild. The ghost rose is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
