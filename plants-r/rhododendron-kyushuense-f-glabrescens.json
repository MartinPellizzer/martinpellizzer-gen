    "intro": "Rhododendron kyushuense f. glabrescens, commonly known as the Kyushu glabrous rhododendron, is a rare and unique variant of the Kyushu rhododendron. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous leaves and flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. Native to southern Japan, this plant thrives in humid, shaded environments with well-drained acidic soil. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a sought-after species in botanical gardens. Due to its limited natural range, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated for its aesthetic value."
