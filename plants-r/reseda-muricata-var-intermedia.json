    "intro": "Reseda muricata var. intermedia, commonly known as the rough wallaby bush, is a perennial shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for coastal and rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rough texture. It is often used in landscaping for its hardiness and ability to provide habitat for native wildlife."
