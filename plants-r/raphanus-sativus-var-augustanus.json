    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. augustanus, commonly known as the black radish, is a biennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its dark purple to black root, which is typically harvested in the second year of growth. The plant produces yellow flowers in a raceme, and its leaves are edible, though often less palatable than those of the common radish. It thrives in cool climates and prefers well-drained soil. The black radish is valued for its peppery flavor and is used in various culinary and medicinal applications."
