    "intro": "Rebutia minor, commonly known as the small stonecress, is a low-growing succulent native to arid regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, blue-green leaves that store water, allowing it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow or white during the spring or early summer. Its roots are shallow and adapted to absorb moisture from the surface soil. Rebutia minor is prized in rock gardens for its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
