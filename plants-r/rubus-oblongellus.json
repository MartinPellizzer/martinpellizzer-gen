    "intro": "Rubus oblongellus, commonly known as the small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less than 1 cm in diameter. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its small size and limited range, it is considered a rare and delicate member of the Rubus genus."
