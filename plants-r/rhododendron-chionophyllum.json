    "intro": "Rhododendron chionophyllum, commonly known as the snow-flower rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and shrublands, preferring cool, moist environments with well-drained soil. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often covered in a fine, silky hair that helps retain moisture. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
