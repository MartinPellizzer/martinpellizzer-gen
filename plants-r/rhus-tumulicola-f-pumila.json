    "intro": "Rhus tumulicola f. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf sumac, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 3 feet, featuring small, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries in the fall. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its dense growth habit makes it an excellent choice for erosion control and as a decorative plant in gardens."
