    "intro": "Rhynchospora prescottiana, commonly known as the Prescott sedge, is a perennial grass-like plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, which allows it to spread vegetatively. Rhynchospora prescottiana plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
