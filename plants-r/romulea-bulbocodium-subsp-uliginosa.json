    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. uliginosa, commonly known as the bog romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It produces delicate, grass-like leaves and striking, bell-shaped flowers in shades of yellow to orange. The plant thrives in wet, boggy environments and is adapted to acidic soils. Its bulbs store nutrients, allowing it to survive in nutrient-poor conditions. It plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
