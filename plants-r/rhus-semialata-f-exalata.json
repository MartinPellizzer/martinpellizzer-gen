    "intro": "Rhus semialata f. exalata, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, dark reddish-brown bark and alternate, simple, glossy dark green leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are followed by small, red berries that persist into winter. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The species is also known for its ornamental value and is sometimes used in landscaping."
