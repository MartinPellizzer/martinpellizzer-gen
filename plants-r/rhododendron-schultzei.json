    "intro": "Rhododendron schultzei, commonly known as the Schultze's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia, particularly in China and Myanmar. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and requires well-drained, acidic soil for optimal growth. It is often found in cloud forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
