    "intro": "Rorippa sylvestris f. olgae, commonly known as the Olgae watercress, is a subspecies of the watercress genus native to Europe. It is a flowering plant that typically grows in moist or aquatic environments, such as stream banks and wet meadows. The plant features small, alternate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with tiny white flowers that appear in clusters. It has a rapid growth rate and can spread through both seeds and vegetative means. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a food source for aquatic organisms and its potential use in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from water."
