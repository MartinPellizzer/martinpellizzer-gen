    "intro": "Rhynchocarpa rostrata, commonly known as the narrow-lobed sandthorn, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It belongs to the family Rutaceae, which includes many aromatic plants. The plant is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, leathery leaves adapted to conserve water. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, a feature typical of many members of the Rutaceae family. Rhynchocarpa rostrata is often found in sandy soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
