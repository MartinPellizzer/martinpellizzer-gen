    "intro": "Rhus radicans f. malacotrichocarpa, commonly known as the variegated box elder, is a variant of the box elder tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive variegated foliage, which features a mix of green, white, and yellow colors on the leaves. The plant is a deciduous shrub or small tree that typically grows in moist, well-drained soils along stream banks and wetlands. It produces small, greenish flowers in early spring, followed by edible, maple-like samaras that are dispersed by wind. The variegation in its leaves is due to a genetic mutation that affects chlorophyll production, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
