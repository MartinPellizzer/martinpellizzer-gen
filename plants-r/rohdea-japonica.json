    "intro": "Rohdea japonica, commonly known as the Japanese sword fern, is a striking evergreen perennial plant native to East Asia. It features a rosette of narrow, leathery, dark green leaves that resemble a sword, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white or greenish flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in shady, moist environments and is often used in ornamental gardening for its elegant appearance. Rohdea japonica is also valued for its ability to tolerate partial shade and its low maintenance requirements."
