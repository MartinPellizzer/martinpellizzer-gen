    "intro": "Rosa pogonobasis, commonly known as the bearded rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces red-orange hips that contain seeds. Rosa pogonobasis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
