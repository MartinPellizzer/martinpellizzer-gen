    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. subcollina, commonly known as the Japanese coral tree, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its striking, pendulous clusters of pink to white flowers that appear in spring. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for gardens and landscapes. Its ornamental value comes from both its showy flowers and its attractive, peeling bark."
