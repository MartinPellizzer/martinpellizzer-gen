    "intro": "Rubus gongshanensis, commonly known as the Gongshan blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the Yunnan province in China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and unique ecological role, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
