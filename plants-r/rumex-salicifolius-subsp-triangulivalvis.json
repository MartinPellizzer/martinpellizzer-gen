    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius subsp. triangulivalvis, commonly known as the triangular-veined sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive triangular leaf venation and serrated margins, which contribute to its unique appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation. The flowers are small and greenish, arranged in clusters, and the plant is known for its ornamental value in gardens."
