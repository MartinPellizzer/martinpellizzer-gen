    "intro": "Ruellia kleinii, commonly known as the Klein's ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are usually blue or purple in color, which attract various pollinators. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Ruellia kleinii is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and landscapes due to its attractive appearance and relatively low maintenance requirements."
