    "intro": "Rebutia oligacantha, commonly known as the \"Paddle Cactus,\" is a species of cactus native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its flat, paddle-shaped stems that are often ribbed and covered in small, white spines. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It is a succulent, storing water in its thick, fleshy stems to survive in arid environments. Rebutia oligacantha thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it a popular choice for desert gardens and indoor collections."
