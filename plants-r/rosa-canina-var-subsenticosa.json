    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subsenticosa, commonly known as the rough-stemmed dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its rough, thorny stems and dense, shrub-like growth habit. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in spring, which are followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges, and the plant is known for its hardiness and adaptability to various soil types. This variety is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its ecological importance as a food source for wildlife."
