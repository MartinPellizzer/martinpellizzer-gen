    "intro": "Regnellidium diphyllum, commonly known as the two-leaved flax, is a perennial herb native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, opposite leaves that are typically lance-shaped. The plant produces tiny, greenish-white flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in open woodlands and grasslands. Botanically, it is notable for its unique leaf arrangement and its role in supporting local insect populations."
