    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius var. subcaesius, commonly known as the blackberry elderberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant produces a distinctive, somewhat aromatic scent. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
