It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes various species of buttercups and water plants. The plant is characterized by its delicate, showy flowers that typically have five to eight petals, often in shades of yellow, white, or orange. It thrives in alpine and subalpine environments, often growing in rocky soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
