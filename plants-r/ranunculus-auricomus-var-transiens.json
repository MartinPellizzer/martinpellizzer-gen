    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus var. transiens, commonly known as the transitory golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as stream banks and forest floors. Its flowers are short-lived, typically lasting only a few days, which gives the plant its common name. It is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to pollinators."
