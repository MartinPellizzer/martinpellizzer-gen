    "intro": "Rhamnus cassinoides, commonly known as the Pacific buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a waxy coating. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters and are followed by small, orange-red berries that are edible for some bird species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
