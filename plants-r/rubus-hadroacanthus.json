    "intro": "Rubus hadroacanthus, commonly known as the hardy thorned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
