    "intro": "Rotala milne-redheadii, commonly known as the redhead waterhyacinth, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It has small, ovate leaves that are typically bright green with a reddish underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, often floating on the water surface. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its rapid growth, it can become invasive in some regions if not managed properly."
