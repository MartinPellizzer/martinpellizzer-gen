    "intro": "Rorippa officinalis, commonly known as watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately compound leaves that are often submerged or floating in water. The plant produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in racemes, which are typically borne on slender stems. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to aquatic environments, allowing it to thrive in moist or submerged soils. Watercress is known for its peppery flavor and has been used in traditional medicine and cuisine for centuries."
