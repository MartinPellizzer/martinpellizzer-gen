It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its lance-shaped, glabrous leaves that are typically white or pale green in color. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers that are usually pink to purple in hue, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forested areas. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
