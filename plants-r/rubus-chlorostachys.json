    "intro": "Rubus chlorostachys, commonly known as the green-stemmed raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, greenish stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers with five petals, and its leaves are pinnately compound with serrated edges. It thrives in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor wild berry in its native range."
