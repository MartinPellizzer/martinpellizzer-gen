    "intro": "Ricinocarpus nemorum, commonly known as the ghost tree, is a unique plant species native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is a climbing shrub that can grow up to 20 meters in height, characterized by its delicate, fern-like leaves and distinctive, pale yellow flowers. The plant produces small, fleshy fruits that contain toxic seeds, which are a significant concern for livestock and humans. Its ecological role includes providing habitat for various insects and birds, contributing to the biodiversity of its native environment. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, Ricinocarpus nemorum is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
