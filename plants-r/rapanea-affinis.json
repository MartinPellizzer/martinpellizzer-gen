    "intro": "Rapanea affinis, commonly known as the African boxwood, is a small evergreen shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and compact growth habit. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible berries that are consumed by various bird species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Due to its slow growth and hardiness, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and as a decorative plant in shaded areas."
