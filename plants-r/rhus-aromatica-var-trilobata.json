    "intro": "Rhus aromatica var. trilobata, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are composed of 5\u201311 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a striking feature in the fall. Smooth sumac is often found in open woods, along streambanks, and in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a valuable plant for ecological restoration and wildlife habitat."
