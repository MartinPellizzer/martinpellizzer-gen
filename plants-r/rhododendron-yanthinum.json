    "intro": "Rhododendron yanthinum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, with a dense covering of fine hairs on the underside. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
