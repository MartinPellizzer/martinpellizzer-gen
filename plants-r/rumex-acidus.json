    "intro": "Rumex acidus, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its serrated, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in dense, upright spikes. Its roots are rich in organic acids, which contribute to its sharp, tangy taste. Rumex acidus is often found in moist soils along roadsides, fields, and stream banks."
