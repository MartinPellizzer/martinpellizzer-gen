    "intro": "Ruppia andina, commonly known as the Andean water plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to South America. It thrives in brackish and freshwater environments, often found in coastal lagoons and estuaries. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that float on the surface of the water. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically submerged, and its seeds are dispersed by water currents. Ruppia andina plays an important ecological role in stabilizing water bodies and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
