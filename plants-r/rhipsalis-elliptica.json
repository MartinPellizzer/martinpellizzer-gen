    "intro": "Rhipsalis elliptica, commonly known as the Christmas cactus, is a unique epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It features slender, branching stems covered in soft, leaf-like structures called phyllodes. The plant produces fragrant, tubular flowers in shades of red, pink, and white during the winter months. Unlike typical cacti, it does not have true leaves or spines, relying on its stems for photosynthesis. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
