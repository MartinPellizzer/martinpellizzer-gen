    "intro": "Ranunculus caricetorum, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow water, along the edges of ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating, with bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize new areas. Ranunculus caricetorum plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms and contributing to water filtration."
