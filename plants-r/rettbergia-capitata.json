    "intro": "Rettbergia capitata, commonly known as the red torch ginger, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers and related plants. The plant is characterized by its striking red bracts that resemble torches, which are actually modified leaves rather than flowers. Its inflorescence consists of small, fragrant flowers that are often hidden within the brightly colored bracts. Rettbergia capitata is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a decorative plant in tropical landscapes."
