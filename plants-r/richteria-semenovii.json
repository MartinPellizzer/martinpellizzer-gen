    "intro": "Richteria semenovii, commonly known as the Semenov's richteria, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Ranunculaceae, which includes buttercups and other showy wildflowers. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
