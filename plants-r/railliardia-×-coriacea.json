    "intro": "Railliardia \u00d7 coriacea, commonly known as the hybrid orchid, is a cross between Railliardia lutea and Railliardia glabra. It is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South Africa, characterized by its erect growth habit and clustered inflorescences. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow and orange, typically blooming during the warmer months. Its leaves are linear and grass-like, forming a rosette at the base, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils. Railliardia \u00d7 coriacea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ease of cultivation in well-drained conditions."
