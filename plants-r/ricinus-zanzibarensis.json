It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, red bracts that surround its small yellow flowers. The plant produces capsule fruits that contain toxic seeds, similar to other species in the Ricinus genus. It thrives in tropical climates and is often found in sandy or coastal soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and botanical collections in warm regions."
