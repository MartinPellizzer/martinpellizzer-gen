    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. mollissima, commonly known as the silvery rose or woolly rose, is a shrub-like species native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, almost silvery appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is generally oval-shaped with a leathery texture, and it is often cultivated for ornamental purposes. Rosa tomentosa var. mollissima is relatively low maintenance and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun."
