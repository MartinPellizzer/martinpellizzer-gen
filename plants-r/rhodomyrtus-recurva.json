    "intro": "Rhodomyrtus recurva, commonly known as the red-flowered guava or red myrtle, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, pinkish-red flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, containing a single seed. Rhodomyrtus recurva is often cultivated for its ornamental value due to its attractive foliage and long-lasting blooms. It thrives in humid, warm climates and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
