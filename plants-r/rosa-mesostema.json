    "intro": "Rosa mesostema, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rose, is a species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring dense, thorny stems and small, narrow leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in the spring, which are attractive to pollinators. Its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Rosa mesostema is well adapted to arid environments and is often found in rocky soils and desert landscapes."
