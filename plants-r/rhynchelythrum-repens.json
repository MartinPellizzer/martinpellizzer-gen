It is a low-growing perennial that spreads via rhizomes, forming dense mats on the ground. The plant has spiny, lance-shaped leaves with a rough texture and produces yellow flowers in composite heads. It is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats such as roadsides and fields. Its botanical features make it a common weed in temperate regions."
