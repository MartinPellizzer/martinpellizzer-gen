    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subobtusulus, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, which are often marked with dark veins. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed segments that are often hairy, and the stems are slender and hairy as well. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, buttercup-like blooms."
