    "intro": "Ritterocactus mueller-melchersii subsp. gutierrezii, commonly known as the Mexican apple cactus, is a species native to the arid regions of Mexico. It is a small, cylindrical cactus with a ribbed stem that can grow up to 30 centimeters in height. The plant produces yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, which are typically clustered at the top of the stems. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to drought conditions. This subspecies is well-suited for xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and unique appearance."
