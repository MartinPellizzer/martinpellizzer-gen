It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many flowering plants known for their medicinal properties. The plant features slender, creeping stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pale pink flowers are typically clustered in racemes, and it produces small, berry-like fruits. The leaves are opposite, ovate, and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive botanical appearance."
