    "intro": "Rajania herradurensis, commonly known as the Herradura's rajania, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its striking, palmate leaves and showy, pale pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat destruction. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this unique botanical species."
