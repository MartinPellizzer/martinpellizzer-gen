    "intro": "Rumex infestus, commonly known as red sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves that are reddish in color, often with a distinctive purple or red tinge on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily, making it both a common weed and a resilient plant in disturbed soils. The leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
