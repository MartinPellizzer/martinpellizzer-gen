It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with prominent veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers that are clustered in loose inflorescences. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
