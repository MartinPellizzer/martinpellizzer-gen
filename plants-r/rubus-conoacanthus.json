    "intro": "Rubus conoacanthus, commonly known as the thorned blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it thrives in woodland and disturbed habitats. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a weed in agricultural and natural areas."
