    "intro": "Restio pumilus, commonly known as the dwarf restio, is a small, herbaceous plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family, which is characterized by grass-like appearance and specialized adaptations to arid environments. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in fynbos vegetation. Its slender, grass-like foliage is often mistaken for a grass or reed, but it has distinct floral structures typical of the restio family. Restio pumilus is adapted to withstand drought and fire, making it a resilient component of its ecosystem."
