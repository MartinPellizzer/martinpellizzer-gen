    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 arenarius, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a hybrid plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils, often in coastal or arid environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. The berries are usually red or black when mature and are edible, though they are often tart and less palatable compared to other raspberry varieties."
