    "intro": "Ranunculus oinonenii, commonly known as the Siberian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the cold regions of Siberia and northern Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by a yellow center and numerous stamens. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It typically grows in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Ranunculus oinonenii is often found in alpine meadows and tundra habitats, where it blooms in early summer."
