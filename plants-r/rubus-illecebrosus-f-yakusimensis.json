    "intro": "Rubus illecebrosus f. yakusimensis, commonly known as the Yakusim raspberry, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
