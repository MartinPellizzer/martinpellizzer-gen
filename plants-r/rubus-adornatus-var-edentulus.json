    "intro": "Rubus adornatus var. edentulus, commonly known as the toothless raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, toothless leaf margins, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation and adaptation."
