    "intro": "Roegneria gmelinii var. macrathera, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in open, disturbed areas such as roadsides, meadows, and agricultural fields. The plant has slender, creeping stems that often form dense mats, and its leaves are narrow, grass-like with a bluish-green hue. It produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, characteristic of the Poaceae family. This variety is noted for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
