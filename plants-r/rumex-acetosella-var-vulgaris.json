    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. vulgaris, commonly known as common sorrel, is a low-growing herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves and reddish stems. It typically thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas, meadows, and along stream banks. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by reddish-brown, three-lobed seeds. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a sour taste and making them useful in culinary applications. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
