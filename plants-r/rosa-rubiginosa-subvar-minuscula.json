    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subvar. minuscula, commonly known as the dwarf shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, with small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow flowers. The plant is characterized by its dense, spreading growth habit and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Its botanical features include stipulate stipules and hairy stems, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soils."
