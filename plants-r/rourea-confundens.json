    "intro": "Rourea confundens, commonly known as the Hawaiian rourea, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, often found in moist, shaded environments on the island of Hawaii. Its leaves are usually opposite and have a distinctive waxy texture, while its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rourea confundens is considered a rare and endangered species."
