    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina subsp. pumila, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant has small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving them a silvery appearance. Its flowers are yellowish-green and appear in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are edible but tart. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often used in ecological restoration projects in high-altitude areas."
