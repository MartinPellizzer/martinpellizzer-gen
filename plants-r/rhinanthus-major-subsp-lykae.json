    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. lykae, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of North Africa. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its presence is an indicator of healthy, diverse grassland ecosystems."
