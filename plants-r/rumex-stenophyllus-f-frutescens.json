    "intro": "Rumex stenophyllus f. frutescens, commonly known as the compact dock, is a compact, herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe. It features upright, branching stems that are typically shorter and more shrub-like compared to the species. The leaves are broad, heart-shaped, and covered with a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a distinctive texture. It produces small, greenish flowers in clusters, which are followed by elongated, reddish-brown seed pods. This form is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in moist, shady environments."
