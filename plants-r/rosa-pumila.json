    "intro": "Rosa pumila, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it withstand harsh alpine conditions. It produces edible hips that are rich in vitamin C. Rosa pumila is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
