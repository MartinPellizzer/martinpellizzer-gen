    "intro": "Rubus bogotensis subsp. eglandulosus, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
