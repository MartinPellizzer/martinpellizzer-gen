    "intro": "Rumex arifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal rosettes of large, lobed, and often hairy leaves that are typically green with a reddish tint on the underside. The plant produces tall, unbranched flowering stems that bear clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, ditches, and along roadsides. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though its primary ecological role is as a component of wetland ecosystems."
