    "intro": "Rhamnus inconspicua, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has dark green, ovate leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Rhamnus inconspicua is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats."
