    "intro": "Rhamnus celtifolia, commonly known as the European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in the autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and dark in color, often marked with longitudinal fissures. Rhamnus celtifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
