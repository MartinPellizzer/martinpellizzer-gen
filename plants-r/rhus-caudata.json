It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive reddish color in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. Rhus caudata thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands, thickets, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
