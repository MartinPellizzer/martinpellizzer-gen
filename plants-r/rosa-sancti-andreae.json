    "intro": "Rosa sancti-andreae, commonly known as the Saint-Andr\u00e9 rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and is typically found in coastal and mountainous regions. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and arranged in an alternate pattern along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa sancti-andreae is considered a vulnerable species."
