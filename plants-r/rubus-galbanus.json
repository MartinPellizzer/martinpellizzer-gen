    "intro": "Rubus galbanus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its yellowish-red fruits, which are typically smaller than those of other raspberry species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and hedgerows. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it suitable for jams and desserts."
