    "intro": "Rhynchosia clivorum, commonly known as the cliff senna, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa. It features compound leaves with elliptical leaflets and produces small, yellowish flowers clustered in racemes. The plant is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are often lobed or spurred. It thrives in rocky or cliff habitats, where it uses its tendrils to climb and anchor itself. Rhynchosia clivorum is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
