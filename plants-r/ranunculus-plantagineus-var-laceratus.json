    "intro": "Ranunculus plantagineus var. laceratus, commonly known as the torn-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is characterized by its finely divided, lobed leaves that give it a distinctive, lace-like appearance. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but is considered rare in the wild."
