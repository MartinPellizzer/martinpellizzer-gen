    "intro": "Rodgersia sambucifolia, commonly known as the silver foxtail, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of China. It features large, lance-shaped leaves with a silvery-white underside, giving it a striking appearance. The plant produces showy, pale pink to white, spadix-like flower clusters that are borne on tall, slender stems. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its foliage and the dramatic contrast between its leaves and flowers."
