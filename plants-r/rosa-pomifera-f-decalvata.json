    "intro": "Rosa pomifera f. decalvata, commonly known as the hairless rose, is a botanical variant of the rose species Rosa pomifera. It is characterized by its reduced or absent pubescence, giving it a smoother appearance compared to typical roses. The plant produces large, apple-like fruits called rose hips, which are typically orange to red in color. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that contribute to its ornamental value. This cultivar is often appreciated for its unique foliage and potential use in horticulture and herbal applications."
