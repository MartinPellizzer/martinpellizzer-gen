    "intro": "Rubus xanthoacanthus, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are typically yellowish in color, and its compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its fruit is similar to other Rubus species but has a distinct flavor and texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
