    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris var. velutinus, commonly known as the velvet blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its dense, velvety pubescence on the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive tactile appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique foliage and berries."
