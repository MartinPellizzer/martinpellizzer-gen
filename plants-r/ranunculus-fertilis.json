It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sun. Ranunculus fertilis is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along streams, where it plays a role in supporting local pollinators."
