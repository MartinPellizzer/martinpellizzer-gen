    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. oblongicalyx, commonly known as the broad-leafed evergreen rose, is a shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that remain evergreen throughout the year. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a long-blooming, evergreen shrub."
