    "intro": "Rubus pubescens subsp. austrotiroliensis, commonly known as the Austro-Tirolian brambles, is a shrub native to the Alps, particularly in Austria and northern Italy. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forest edges. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
