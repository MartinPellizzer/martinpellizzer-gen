    "intro": "Rauvolfia pentaphylla, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring woody stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Its roots and leaves are used in traditional medicine for their hypotensive properties, containing alkaloids such as reserpine. Rauvolfia pentaphylla is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its foliage."
