It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils. It is characterized by its short stature and is often found in high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
