    "intro": "Romulea ligustica var. stenotepala, commonly known as the narrow-tipped romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The flowers, which typically range in color from white to pink, are borne on tall, slender stems. This variant is distinguished by its narrower tepals compared to the typical form of Romulea ligustica. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or sandy habitats."
