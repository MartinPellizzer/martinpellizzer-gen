    "intro": "Rudgea sanluisensis, commonly known as the San Luis mountain vine, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by pods containing seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats at higher elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
