    "intro": "Rubus kurzianus, commonly known as the Kurz's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less commonly cultivated species."
