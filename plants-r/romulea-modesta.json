It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered bulbs that help it survive in arid conditions. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Romulea modesta is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable climates."
