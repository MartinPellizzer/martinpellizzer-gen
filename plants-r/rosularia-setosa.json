    "intro": "Rosularia setosa, commonly known as the hairy rose bush, is a perennial flowering plant native to central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit with numerous stems that bear small, clustered flowers. The plant features fuzzy, hairy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rosularia setosa produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
