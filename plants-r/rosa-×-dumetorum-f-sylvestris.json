    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild dog rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these are often used in herbal remedies. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
