    "intro": "Rottboellia stipoides, commonly known as the narrowleaf rottbollias, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and pastures. Due to its rapid growth and ability to spread vegetatively, it can become invasive in certain environments."
