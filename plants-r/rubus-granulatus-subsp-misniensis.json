    "intro": "Rubus granulatus subsp. misniensis, commonly known as the Misni mountain raspberry, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
