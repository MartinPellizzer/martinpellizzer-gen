    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. myrtifolia, commonly known as the myrtle-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark green leaves that resemble those of myrtle. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping for erosion control."
