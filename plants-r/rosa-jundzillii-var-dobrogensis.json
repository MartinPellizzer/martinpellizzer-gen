It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for gardens with specific conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
