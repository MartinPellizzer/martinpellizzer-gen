It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are often clustered in groups of three. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in alpine ecosystems."
