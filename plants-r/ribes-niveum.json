    "intro": "Ribes niveum, commonly known as white currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is part of the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a versatile addition to gardens. The berries are often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to their tart flavor."
