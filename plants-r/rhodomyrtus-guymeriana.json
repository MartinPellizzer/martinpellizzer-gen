    "intro": "Rhodomyrtus guymeriana, commonly known as the Guymer's rose myrtle, is a small evergreen shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that appear in spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible but often used in traditional Indigenous cuisine. It thrives in coastal and wetland areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade. Rhodomyrtus guymeriana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
