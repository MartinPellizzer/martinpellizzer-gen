    "intro": "Rubus flexuosus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Rubus flexuosus plays a role in supporting local wildlife, particularly birds and small mammals."
