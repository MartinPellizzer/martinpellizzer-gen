    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. maroccana, commonly known as the Moroccan romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Morocco. It features striking, tubular flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, arranged in a dense, terminal inflorescence. The plant produces a basal bulb that serves as its primary storage organ, allowing it to survive in arid conditions. Its leaves are grass-like and narrow, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
