It belongs to the family Araceae, which includes many aquatic and semi-aquatic plants. The plant is characterized by its broad, undulating leaves that can grow up to several feet in length. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in an inflorescence called a spadix, surrounded by a modified leaf called a spathe. Racinaea undulifolia is often found in wetland environments and is valued for its ornamental foliage in aquatic gardens."
