It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage, which gives it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils. Due to its compact growth habit, it is suitable for rock gardens and as a border plant."
