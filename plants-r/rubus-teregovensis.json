It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus genus."
