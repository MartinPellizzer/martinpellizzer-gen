    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-stemmed rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its woody stems and small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well adapted to arid environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and it produces red-orange hips that contain seeds. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements."
