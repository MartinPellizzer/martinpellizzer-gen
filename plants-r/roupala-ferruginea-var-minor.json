    "intro": "Roupala ferruginea var. minor, commonly known as the small-leaved ironwood, is a shrub or small tree native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by woody, spherical fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in coastal and lowland areas, often growing in sandy or rocky soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in landscaping and for erosion control in tropical regions."
