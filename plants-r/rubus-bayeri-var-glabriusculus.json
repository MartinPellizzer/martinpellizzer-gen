    "intro": "Rubus bayeri var. glabriusculus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or thicket habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
