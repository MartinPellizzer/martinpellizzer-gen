    "intro": "Rubus ctenodon, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black in color, though they are often covered in a fine, fuzzy coating. Native to parts of Asia, it thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and shrublands. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural study."
