    "intro": "Rhododendron pumilum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States. It typically reaches a height of only 12 to 24 inches, with dense, leathery foliage that is dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its compact size and ornamental flowers make it a valuable addition to native plant landscapes."
