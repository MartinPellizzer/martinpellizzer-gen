    "intro": "Ranunculus californicus var. gratus, commonly known as the California buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. It plays an important role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in native plant gardens."
