It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves with glandular dots on the underside. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in forested or open slopes. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
