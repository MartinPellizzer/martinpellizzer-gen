    "intro": "Ranunculus sublongimammus, commonly known as the long-hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy stem, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered with fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant blooms."
