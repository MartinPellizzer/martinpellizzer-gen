    "intro": "Rhododendron calophytum var. calophytum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its showy flowers. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, fragrant blooms in shades of pink to red, which appear in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is a popular choice for landscape planting in cooler climates."
