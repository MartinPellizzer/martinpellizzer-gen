    "intro": "Ricinodendron africanum, commonly known as the African balsa or African kapok tree, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Central and West Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, pale bark and large, simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody pods containing flat, leathery seeds. It is valued for its lightweight, buoyant wood, which is used in construction and as a flotation device. The plant also has cultural and traditional significance in various African communities."
