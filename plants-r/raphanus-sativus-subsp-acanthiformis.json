    "intro": "Raphanus sativus subsp. acanthiformis, commonly known as the curly top mustard, is a wild relative of the domesticated radish. It is characterized by its compact, hairy stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant produces small, round, pale green or reddish-brown seeds that are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying genetic diversity in the Brassicaceae family."
