It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's growth. The plant produces aggregate fruits, commonly referred to as berries, which are typically red when ripe. These berries are often used in culinary applications, such as jams and pies, due to their tart flavor. The plant thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils."
