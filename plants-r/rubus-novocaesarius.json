    "intro": "Rubus novocaesarius, commonly known as the New Zealand blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in regions outside its native range."
