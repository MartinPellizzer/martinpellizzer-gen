    "intro": "Rhinanthus major var. apterus, commonly known as the common yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, attracting various pollinators such as bees and hoverflies. It typically grows in grasslands, heaths, and disturbed soils, often forming dense colonies. Its presence can help suppress dominant grasses, promoting biodiversity in grassland ecosystems."
