The plant typically has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, which are typical of many Rubus species. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate berry that can vary in color from red to black. This hybrid is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its edible fruits and ornamental qualities."
