    "intro": "Rigiolepis minimiflora, commonly known as the dwarf starflower, is a small, herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features delicate, star-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and grows close to the ground, often forming dense mats in its natural habitat. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its small size and ornamental flowers, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts of alpine plants."
