It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Ranunculus ficaria and Ranunculus bulbosus, characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers with deeply cut petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate or palmately lobed, and it produces small, showy blooms in early spring. Ranunculus \u00d7 intermediifolius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens."
