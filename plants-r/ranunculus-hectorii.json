    "intro": "Ranunculus hectorii, commonly known as the Hector's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States, particularly found in California and Oregon. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, meadow-like environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding vibrant color to its native habitat. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
