    "intro": "Rhamnus villarsii, commonly known as the Sierra buckthorn, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in California. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to dry, rocky habitats and is often found in chaparral and woodland areas. Its fruit is a small, smooth, dark blue berry that ripens in the fall. Rhamnus villarsii plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects, through its flowers and fruits."
