    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that are often rounded at the tips. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by reddish-black berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though care must be taken due to its potential invasiveness."
