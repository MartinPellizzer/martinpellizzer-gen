It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor to various surfaces. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and often have a soft, fuzzy texture. This species is native to parts of Europe and is often found in disturbed soils and along woodland edges."
