    "intro": "Roldana grimesii, commonly known as Grimes' roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family and is characterized by its small, daisy-like flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, preferring cool and moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ornamental value in horticulture. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for conservation purposes."
