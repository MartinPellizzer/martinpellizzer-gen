It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in terminal inflorescences, followed by elliptical, red or orange berries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Randia tetracantha is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
