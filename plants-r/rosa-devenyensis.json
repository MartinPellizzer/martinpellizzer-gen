    "intro": "Rosa devenyensis, commonly known as the Deveny rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its fragrant, pinkish-white flowers and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. The plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
