    "intro": "Rubus exaltatus var. plicatus, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a thorny shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruit is a red, juicy berry that ripens in summer. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. It plays a role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and small mammals, by providing food and shelter."
