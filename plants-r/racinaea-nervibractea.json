It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically green or white in color. Its roots are fibrous and can become invasive, making it a common weed in agricultural settings. Racinaea nervibractea thrives in moist, warm environments and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks."
