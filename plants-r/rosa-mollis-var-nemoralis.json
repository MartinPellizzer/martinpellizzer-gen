    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. nemoralis, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, fragrant pink or white flowers, and dark green, glossy leaves. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and hedgerows, thriving in partial shade. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. The hips, or fruit, develop in autumn and are edible, often used in jams and teas."
