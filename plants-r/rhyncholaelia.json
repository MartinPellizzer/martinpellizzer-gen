    "intro": "Rhyncholaelia, commonly known as the orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. These plants are characterized by their complex, often showy flowers and specialized structures such as the labellum and column. Rhyncholaelia species are typically epiphytic or lithophytic, growing on trees or rocks in tropical and subtropical regions. They possess pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, and their roots are adapted for absorbing moisture from the air. The genus includes several species that are popular in horticulture due to their ornamental value and unique floral morphology."
