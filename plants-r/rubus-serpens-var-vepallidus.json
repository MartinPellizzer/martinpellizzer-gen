    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. vepallidus, commonly known as the pale-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, trailing growth habit and small, pale green leaves that distinguish it from other Rubus species. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a small, dark purple berry. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to its small size and less developed flavor."
