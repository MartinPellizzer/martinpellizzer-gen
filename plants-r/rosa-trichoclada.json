    "intro": "Rosa trichoclada, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on the stems and leaves, which provides insulation and protection against harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rosa trichoclada is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient species in its native range."
