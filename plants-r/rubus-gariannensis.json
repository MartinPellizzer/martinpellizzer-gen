    "intro": "Rubus gariannensis, commonly known as the Gariannen blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and streamside habitats. Its flowers are white with five petals and are typically visited by pollinators like bees and butterflies. The fruit is edible, though often described as having a tart flavor with a slight musky aroma."
