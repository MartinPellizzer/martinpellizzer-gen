It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant produces red, hairy fruits that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in coastal and rocky habitats, often growing in well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native range."
