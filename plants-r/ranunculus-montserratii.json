    "intro": "Ranunculus montserratii, commonly known as the Montserrat buttercup, is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a prominent central stigma. The plant typically grows in rocky or grassy areas at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps protect it from harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
