    "intro": "Ranunculus lappaceus var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf lake buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features small, delicate flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a central yellowish-green pistil, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
