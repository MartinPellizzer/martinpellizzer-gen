    "intro": "Rhododendron lamprophyllum, commonly known as the silver-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that exhibits a striking silvery-blue hue on the underside of its leaves. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation areas."
