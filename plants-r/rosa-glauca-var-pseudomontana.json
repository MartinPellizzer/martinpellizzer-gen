    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. pseudomontana, commonly known as the Sierra lavender rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, pale pink to lavender-colored flowers. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine, powdery bloom that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or alpine environments. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ornamental appeal in gardens and natural landscapes."
