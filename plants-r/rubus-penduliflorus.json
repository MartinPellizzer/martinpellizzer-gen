    "intro": "Rubus penduliflorus, commonly known as the hanging-flower blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that hang in clusters, giving it its common name. Its fruit, a small, dark-colored berry, is edible but not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties. The plant is often found in wetlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils."
