    "intro": "Rhaphidophora kinabaluensis, commonly known as the Kinabalu staghorn fern, is a unique epiphytic plant native to the mountainous regions of Borneo. It belongs to the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that form a rosette shape. The plant produces striking, spadix-like inflorescences that are often covered in a dense layer of bright orange or red spathes. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires high humidity and indirect light to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
