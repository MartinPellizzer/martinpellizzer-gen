    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. inaequabilis, commonly known as the unequal-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller and more acidic than those of other blackberry species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forest understories or along streambanks. Due to its unique fruit characteristics, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
