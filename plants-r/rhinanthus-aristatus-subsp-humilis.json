    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus subsp. humilis, commonly known as the lesser yellow rattle, is a flowering plant in the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August. It is typically found in grasslands and meadows, often in association with grasses like timothy and fescue. Its presence is an indicator of well-managed, biodiverse habitats."
