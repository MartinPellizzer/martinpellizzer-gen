    "intro": "Ranunculus dyris var. ayachicus, commonly known as the Ayachic mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with prominent white veins. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in early spring, adding a splash of color to the mountainous landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
