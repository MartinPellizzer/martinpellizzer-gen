    "intro": "Rubus virgultorum, commonly known as blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and arranged alternately along the stem. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color when mature. These fruits are edible and often used in culinary applications, though the plant is also valued for its ornamental features. Rubus virgultorum is native to various regions in North America and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
