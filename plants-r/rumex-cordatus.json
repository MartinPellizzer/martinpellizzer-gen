    "intro": "Rumex cordatus, commonly known as heartleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, which is characteristic of the Rumex genus. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex cordatus is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
