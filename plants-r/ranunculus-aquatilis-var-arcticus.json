It typically grows in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features finely divided, feather-like leaves that help it float on the water's surface. Its flowers are usually yellow or greenish-yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
