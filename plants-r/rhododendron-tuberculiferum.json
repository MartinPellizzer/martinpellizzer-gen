    "intro": "Rhododendron tuberculiferum, commonly known as the mountain rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. Rhododendron tuberculiferum is often found in forested areas at high altitudes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of the ecosystem."
