    "intro": "Restrepiopsis trilobata, commonly known as the three-lobed restrepiopsis, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It belongs to the family Restrepiopsidaceae and is characterized by its unique, trifoliate leaves with three distinct lobes. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, often blooming in the early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered endangered and is found primarily in high-altitude cloud forests. Its botanical study is important for understanding the biodiversity of Andean flora and its ecological adaptations."
