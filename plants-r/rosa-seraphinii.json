    "intro": "Rosa seraphinii, commonly known as the Seraphinii rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the high altitudes of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist climate to flourish. Its leaves are finely divided and covered in a soft, silvery down, adding to its ornamental appeal. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rosa seraphinii is considered a species of conservation concern."
