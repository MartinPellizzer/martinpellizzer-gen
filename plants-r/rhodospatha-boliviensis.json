It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically feature vibrant colors such as red, orange, and yellow. The plant has strap-like leaves and produces pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, adapting it to its often-dry habitat. It thrives in high-altitude environments with cool temperatures and moderate humidity. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by enthusiasts."
