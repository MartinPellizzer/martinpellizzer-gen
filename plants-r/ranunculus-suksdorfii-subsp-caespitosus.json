    "intro": "Ranunculus suksdorfii subsp. caespitosus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense,\u4e1b\u751f (clumped) growth habit and consists of basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky or sandy soils and is often found in alpine meadows and subalpine zones. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
