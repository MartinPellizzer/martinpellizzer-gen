    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ohmineanus, commonly known as the Japanese raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus strumosus (blackberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red, though some varieties may have a slightly different hue. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible berries. The botanical features of Rubus \u00d7 ohmineanus make it a valuable species in both horticulture and ecological studies."
