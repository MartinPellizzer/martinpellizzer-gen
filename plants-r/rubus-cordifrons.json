    "intro": "Rubus cordifrons, commonly known as the heartleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The leaves are heart-shaped, which gives the plant its common name, and they are usually dark green with a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in umbels, followed by black, edible berries that ripen in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets."
