    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. setifer, commonly known as the hairy willowberry, is a perennial shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries that are a distinctive feature of this variety. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its rugged appearance. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
