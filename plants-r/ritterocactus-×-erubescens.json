    "intro": "Ritterocactus \u00d7 erubescens, commonly known as the red-tipped ritterocactus, is a hybrid cactus species native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its columnar stems that are often ribbed and covered in spines. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne at the stem tips. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun exposure to flourish. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations in its foliage and floral characteristics."
