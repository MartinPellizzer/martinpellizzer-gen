    "intro": "Rubus sylvestris, commonly known as blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a dark green upper surface. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are composed of small drupelets surrounded by a white, fuzzy epicarp. These fruits are edible, though they are often covered in a sticky substance called burs. Rubus sylvestris is native to various regions in the Northern Hemisphere and is commonly found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils."
