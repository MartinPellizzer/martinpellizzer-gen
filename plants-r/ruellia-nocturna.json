    "intro": "Ruellia nocturna, commonly known as nightshade ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that are typically blue or purple in color. These flowers open in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Ruellia nocturna is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and unique blooming habit."
