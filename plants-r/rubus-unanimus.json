    "intro": "Rubus unanimus, commonly known as the single-stem blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its single, upright stem and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in dry, rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
