    "intro": "Rhododendron ramentaceum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found at high altitudes where temperatures are lower. Its flowers are typically borne on short pedicels and are adapted to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron ramentaceum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and alpine landscapes."
