    "intro": "Rubus leucanthus, commonly known as the white-flowered raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, white to pale yellow flowers. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its fruits, which are small and reddish, are edible but not as commonly cultivated as other raspberry species. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to local wildlife."
