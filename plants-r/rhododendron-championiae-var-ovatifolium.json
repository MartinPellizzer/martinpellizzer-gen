    "intro": "Rhododendron championiae var. ovatifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved champion rhododendron, is a rare and specialized evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its large, ovate, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking visual contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires high humidity and partial shade for optimal growth. Its floral display consists of clusters of pink to reddish-purple blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a conservation concern and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its ornamental and ecological value."
