    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla f. marginata, commonly known as the variegated rose, is a botanical variant of the prickly rose. It is characterized by its distinctive foliage, which features white or yellow marginal markings on otherwise green leaves. This form is typically propagated through grafting or cuttings due to its unstable genetic expression. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers, similar to its parent species, and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. Its ornamental value makes it a sought-after addition to gardens and botanical collections."
