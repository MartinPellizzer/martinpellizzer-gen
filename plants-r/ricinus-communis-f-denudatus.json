    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. denudatus, commonly known as the naked castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its reduced leaf pubescence. This plant exhibits a unique botanical trait of having nearly hairless leaves, which distinguishes it from the typical castor plant. It retains the same basic morphology as the species, including the distinctive spiny calyx and the large, palmate leaves. The flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, a feature typical of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is primarily cultivated for ornamental purposes due to its unique appearance and is also used in some traditional medicinal applications."
