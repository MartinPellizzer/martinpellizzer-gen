    "intro": "Rhodoptera, commonly known as the sunset butterfly, is a genus of butterflies found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. These butterflies are characterized by their vibrant, often iridescent wing patterns that resemble the hues of a sunset. The plants they interact with are typically flowering species, which provide nectar for their feeding habits. Their life cycle involves a complex relationship with host plants for laying eggs and feeding larvae. Botanically, the study of Rhodoptera includes understanding their ecological roles and interactions with plant communities."
