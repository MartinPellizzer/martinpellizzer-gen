    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor subsp. resimus, commonly known as the lesser yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces small, yellowish-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. It typically grows in grasslands, meadows, and disturbed soils, often in association with grasses. Its role in supporting pollinators and maintaining grassland biodiversity makes it ecologically significant."
