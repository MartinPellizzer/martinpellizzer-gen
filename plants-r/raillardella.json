    "intro": "Raillardella, commonly known as the \"blue-eyed grass,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Poaceae. It is characterized by its small, grass-like appearance with narrow leaves and clusters of tiny, blue or purple flowers. Raillardella species are typically found in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. The plant is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements. Its flowers attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies, contributing to local biodiversity."
