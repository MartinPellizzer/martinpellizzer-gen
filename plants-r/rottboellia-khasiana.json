It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, cylindrical leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories or on rocky slopes. Rottboellia khasiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional practices in its native region."
