It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural use in gardens and landscapes. However, it is also valued for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
