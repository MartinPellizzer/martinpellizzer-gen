    "intro": "Rubus wrightii var. ouensanensis, commonly known as the Ouensanensis blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to specific regions of Mexico. It is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists for its potential in cultivation and ecological studies."
