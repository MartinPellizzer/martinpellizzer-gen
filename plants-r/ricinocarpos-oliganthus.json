    "intro": "Ricinocarpos oliganthus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Cucurbitaceae, which includes cucumbers and gourds, though it is not closely related to those plants. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit, hairy stems, and small, pale green leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with separate male and female flowers on the same plant, and it produces small, round fruits that are typically green when mature. The species is adapted to harsh environments and is often found in sandy or rocky soils."
