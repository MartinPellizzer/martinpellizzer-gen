    "intro": "Rumex cyprius subsp. cyprius, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves that are reddish on the underside, often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on erect, slender stalks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, calcareous soils. It is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor reminiscent of rhubarb."
