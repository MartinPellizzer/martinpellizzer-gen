    "intro": "Rhus pterocarpa, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to North America. It is characterized by its thick, deeply furrowed bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, spiny fruit clusters. Its acorns are encased in a hard, spiky cap and are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus pterocarpa is often found in moist, well-drained soils in woodlands and along riverbanks."
