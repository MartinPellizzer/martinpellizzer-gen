    "intro": "Rhus orientalis, commonly known as the Chinese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds. Rhus orientalis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
