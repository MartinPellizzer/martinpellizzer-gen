    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. colomannensis, commonly known as the Colomann's blue rose, is a rare and unique variant of the blue rose species. It is characterized by its striking pale blue to bluish-white petals, which are a result of specific pigmentation and genetic traits. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, where it thrives in cool, temperate climates. It typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and produces small, fragrant flowers in late spring. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
