    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white berries, which are distinct from the typical dark-colored fruits of the main species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible fruits that are less common than those of other Rubus species."
