    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 symmetricus var. chladnensis, commonly known as the Chladnenschmid raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are composed of multiple small drupelets, and is often found in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it blooms with white to pinkish flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for both ornamental purposes and its edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other raspberry species."
