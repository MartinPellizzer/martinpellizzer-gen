    "intro": "Rubus deschoviciensis, commonly known as the Deschovici's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes a wide variety of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its prickly stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a relatively rare and less studied species within the Rubus genus."
