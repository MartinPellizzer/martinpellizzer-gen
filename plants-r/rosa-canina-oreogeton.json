    "intro": "Rosa canina oreogeton, commonly known as the dog rose or wild rose, is a shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Rosa canina oreogeton thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
