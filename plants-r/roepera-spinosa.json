The plant is characterized by its woody stems covered in sharp, spiny structures, which serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with five petals and a distinctive spurred shape. Roepera spinosa is often found in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments."
