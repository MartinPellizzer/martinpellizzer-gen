    "intro": "Rubus kolbei, commonly known as Kolbei's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The plant is a shrub that produces edible berries, similar to other Rubus species, with a distinctive flavor and texture. Its leaves are trifoliate, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
