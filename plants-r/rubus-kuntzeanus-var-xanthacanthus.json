    "intro": "Rubus kuntzeanus var. xanthacanthus, commonly known as the yellow-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, reddish stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with compound leaves and small white flowers. Its berries are edible but have a tart flavor, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded habitats. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique stem coloration and specific geographic distribution."
