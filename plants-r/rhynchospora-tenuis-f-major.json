It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and spike-like inflorescences that bear small, three-lobed flowers. The plant typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and other moist environments, showcasing its adaptability to aquatic or semi-aquatic conditions. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense stands that contribute to soil stabilization. The species is of interest in ecological studies due to its role in wetland ecosystems and its potential for wetland restoration projects."
