    "intro": "Ranunculus nemoricola, commonly known as the water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and marshy environments in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers that are typically yellow or orange with dark centers, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive hairy texture. The plant thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along streams, ditches, and other waterlogged habitats. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ranunculus nemoricola is characterized by its short, stout stems and its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent presence in wetland ecosystems."
