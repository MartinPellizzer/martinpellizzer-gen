    "intro": "Roseocereus tetracanthus, commonly known as the four-armed cactus, is a species of cactus native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that are covered in spines and are often branched at the base. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the summer months, which are typically borne on the upper parts of the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized plant."
