It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are followed by edible, fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used in ornamental gardening. Its unique growth habit and attractive foliage make it a popular choice for trellises and hanging baskets."
