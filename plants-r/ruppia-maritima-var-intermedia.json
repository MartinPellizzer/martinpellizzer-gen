It typically grows in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish to slightly saline conditions. The plant has narrow, ribbon-like leaves that are often submerged, and it produces small, yellow flowers that float on the water surface. It is an important component of coastal ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms. Its distribution is primarily along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America."
