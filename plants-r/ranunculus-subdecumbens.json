    "intro": "Ranunculus subdecumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, and it typically blooms from late spring to early summer. The plant has a sprawling habit, with stems that lie close to the ground and produce numerous small, clustered flowers. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. Ranunculus subdecumbens is often found in wet meadows, stream banks, and other damp habitats."
