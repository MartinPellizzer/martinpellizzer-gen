    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea subsp. sachalinensis, commonly known as the Sakhalin rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It thrives in alpine and subarctic environments, typically growing in well-drained, rocky soils at high elevations. The plant features wiry stems and fleshy, grass-like leaves, with small, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It is closely related to other rhodiola species and is often used in traditional medicine for its adaptogenic properties. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for harsh climatic conditions."
