It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, and is characterized by its simple, opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers, which are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. It typically grows as an erect shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. The bark and leaves of Rourea albidoflavescens have been used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties."
