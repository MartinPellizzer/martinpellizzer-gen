    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana var. puberula, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Asia. It features thorny stems and is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence, particularly on the leaves and young shoots. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine, soft down. Rosa afzeliana var. puberula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and visual interest."
