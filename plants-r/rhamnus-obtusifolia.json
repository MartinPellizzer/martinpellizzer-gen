    "intro": "Rhamnus obtusifolia, commonly known as the blunt-leaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The plant features small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green and have a leathery texture. Its flowers are clustered in small inflorescences and are followed by small, black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Rhamnus obtusifolia is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in challenging environmental conditions."
