    "intro": "Rhododendron kingdonii, commonly known as the Kingdon's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests, where it thrives in cool, moist, and shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant pink or red flowers. Rhododendron kingdonii is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
