    "intro": "Ranunculus parviflorus var. glabrescens, commonly known as the glabrous meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers with five petals and a hairy central stigma. The plant typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three heart-shaped leaflets, and it produces a basal rosette of foliage. The variety 'glabrescens' is distinguished by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, setting it apart from other varieties of Ranunculus parviflorus."
