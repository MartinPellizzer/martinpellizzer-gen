    "intro": "Rottboellia rariflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and narrow, blade-like leaves that are typically smooth and hairless. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Rottboellia rariflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its fine texture and upright growth habit."
