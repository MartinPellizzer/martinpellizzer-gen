    "intro": "Rosa transsilvanica var. subsystylis, commonly known as the Transylvanian substyle rose, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the Rosa transsilvanica species. It is native to the Carpathian Mountains in Central Europe, specifically found in Romania and parts of Hungary. This plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pink to white. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves, and it produces rose hips that are typically red or orange in color. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
