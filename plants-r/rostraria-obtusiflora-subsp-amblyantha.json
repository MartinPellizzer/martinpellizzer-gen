    "intro": "Rostraria obtusiflora subsp. amblyantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rostraria, is a rare and specialized member of the Apiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, hairy stems and small, clustered umbels of white flowers. The subspecies is distinguished by its reduced, obtuse flower heads and narrower leaves compared to the typical form. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats, often found in woodland areas with rich, loamy soil. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
