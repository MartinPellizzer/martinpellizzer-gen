    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. suboxyphylla, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
