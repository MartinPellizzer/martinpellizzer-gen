    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 scituliformis, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a hybrid plant belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated edges, typical of many Rubus species. It is often found in temperate regions, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
