    "intro": "Richthofenia, commonly known as the \"devil's backbone,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Apiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive, often spiny stems and compound leaves that resemble a backbone. The flowers are small and clustered in umbels, typical of the carrot family. Richthofenia species are typically found in arid or rocky habitats, thriving in regions with low moisture. These plants are sometimes used in traditional medicine, though their botanical study remains limited."
