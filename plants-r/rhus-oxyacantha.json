    "intro": "Rhus oxyacantha, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and often have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, fuzzy berries that are a common food source for birds. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive, horn-like appearance on older stems. Rhus oxyacantha is often found in dry, disturbed soils and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
