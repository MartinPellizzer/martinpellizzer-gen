    "intro": "Rapuntium erinoides, commonly known as the mountain hellebore, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It features a thick, rhizomatous root system and lance-shaped, dark green leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to greenish flowers in the spring, which are followed by small, berry-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its toxic properties, it is not typically cultivated for ornamental or medicinal purposes."
