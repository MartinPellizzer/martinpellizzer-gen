    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis f. vestitus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry. This variant of the pyramidal raspberry is characterized by its dense, hairy covering on both the stems and leaves, which provides a distinct appearance. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, aggregate fruits, typically red in color, similar to other raspberries in the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its hairy foliage and fruit make it a unique and visually striking member of the Rosaceae family."
