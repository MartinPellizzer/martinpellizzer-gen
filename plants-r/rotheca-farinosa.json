    "intro": "Rotheca farinosa, commonly known as the woolly rotheca, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, white, woolly covering on its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in clusters during the spring and summer months. Rotheca farinosa thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or arid environments. Its unique morphology makes it a notable species in its native habitats."
