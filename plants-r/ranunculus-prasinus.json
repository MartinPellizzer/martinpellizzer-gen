    "intro": "Ranunculus prasinus, commonly known as the green water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in shallow freshwater environments such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, arrow-shaped leaves that float on the water surface or are submerged. Its flowers are small, yellow, and often have five petals, blooming from spring to summer. Ranunculus prasinus plays a vital role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and fish."
