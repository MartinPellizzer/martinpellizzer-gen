    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina var. parvifolia, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the autumn. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is an important part of the mountain ecosystem."
