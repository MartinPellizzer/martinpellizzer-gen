    "intro": "Rivina tinctoria, commonly known as the redroot false mallow, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking red stems and showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Its historical use as a natural dye source has also contributed to its ecological and cultural significance."
