    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. adscendens, commonly known as the ascending buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that are often mistaken for petals. The plant has a short, tuberous root system and hairy, lobed leaves that are typically basal and arranged in a rosette. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The species is characterized by its ascending growth habit, with stems that rise gradually from the base rather than being prostrate."
