    "intro": "Rheedia pedicellata, commonly known as the creeping rheedia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Marcgraviaceae and is characterized by its rhizomatous growth habit, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, often borne on short pedicels. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Rheedia pedicellata is often found in shaded, humid environments, such as understorey habitats in tropical rainforests."
