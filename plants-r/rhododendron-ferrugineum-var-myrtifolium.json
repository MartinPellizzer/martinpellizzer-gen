It features small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in early spring, which are characteristic of the Rhododendron genus. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, shaded environments. This variety is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and hardiness in rocky gardens."
