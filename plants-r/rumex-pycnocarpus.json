    "intro": "Rumex pycnocarpus, commonly known as the dense-fruited sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant is characterized by its alternate, ovate leaves with a reddish or purple tint on the underside. Its small, green flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, round fruits that are typically retained on the plant for an extended period. Rumex pycnocarpus is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
