    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. odontocarpus, commonly known as the serrated dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North America. It is characterized by its distinctive serrated, wavy leaves that are often reddish at the edges. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily in moist, disturbed soils. It is often found in wetlands, meadows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
