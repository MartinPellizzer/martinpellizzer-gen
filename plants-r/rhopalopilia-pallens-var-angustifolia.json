    "intro": "Rhopalopilia pallens var. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrowleaf rhopalopilia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The flowers are typically white or pale blue and are arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or dry landscapes. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
