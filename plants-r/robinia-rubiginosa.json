    "intro": "Robinia rubiginosa, commonly known as the yellowwood tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its distinctive, compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and turn a striking yellow in the fall. The tree produces yellow, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its deep root system makes it highly drought-tolerant and capable of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. The bark is thick, fissured, and often covered in a sticky resin, which gives it its common name \"stinkwood.\""
