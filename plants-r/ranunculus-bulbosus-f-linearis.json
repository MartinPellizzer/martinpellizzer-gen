    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus f. linearis, commonly known as the linear buttercup, is a variant of the bulbous buttercup characterized by its elongated, narrow leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. Its flowers are typically yellow with five petals, and it blooms from late spring to early summer. The foliage is lance-shaped, distinguishing it from the more commonly seen varieties of Ranunculus. It is a herbaceous perennial that spreads through rhizomes, forming dense colonies in suitable habitats."
