    "intro": "Retiniphyllum scabrum var. ayangannense, commonly known as the Ayangannese retiniphyllum, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive, spiny leaves and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the early spring. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, typically found in dense tropical forests. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to retain moisture in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
