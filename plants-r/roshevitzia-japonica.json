    "intro": "Roshevitzia japonica, commonly known as the Japanese rosewood, is a species of flowering plant native to Japan. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a sought-after material in traditional crafts and furniture-making. However, due to overharvesting, it is now listed as an endangered species in its native habitat."
