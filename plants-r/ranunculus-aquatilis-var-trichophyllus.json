    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. trichophyllus, commonly known as the hairy water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup native to freshwater habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its finely divided, trifoliate leaves covered in a dense layer of soft, hairy trichomes, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams. Its flowers are yellow with five petal-like sepals, and it produces small, greenish fruits that disperse via water. Due to its aquatic habitat and hairy foliage, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
