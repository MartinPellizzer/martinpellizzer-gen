This evergreen shrub is native to China and is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with elliptical leaves that are slightly larger than the typical variety. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically pink or white, which bloom in the spring. It is well-suited for container gardening and can thrive in full sun to partial shade. Its compact growth habit makes it ideal for use as a hedge or ornamental plant in gardens."
