It features showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a fine, membranous layer, giving it its subspecies name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along streambanks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to native plant gardens."
