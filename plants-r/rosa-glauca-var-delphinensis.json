    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. delphinensis, commonly known as the Delphinian rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant features slender, thornless stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
