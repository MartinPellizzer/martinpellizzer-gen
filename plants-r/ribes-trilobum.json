    "intro": "Ribes trilobum, commonly known as the three-lobed gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It belongs to the genus Ribes, which includes various species of flowering plants in the family Grossulariaceae. The plant features small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible, tart berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are typically three-lobed, hence the common name, and are covered in a fine layer of pubescence. Ribes trilobum is often found in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
