It typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stalks. It is often found in meadows, stream banks, and forested areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The leaves are edible and have a slightly sour taste, making it a potential forage plant in certain regions."
