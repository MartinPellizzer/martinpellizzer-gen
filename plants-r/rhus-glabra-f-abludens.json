    "intro": "Rhus glabra f. abludens, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub or small tree characterized by its smooth, gray bark and compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important plant for ecological studies and ornamental gardening."
