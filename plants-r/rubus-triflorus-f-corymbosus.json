    "intro": "Rubus triflorus f. corymbosus, commonly known as the clustered blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique floral and fruiting structures. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of North America, particularly in the eastern United States. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, and its flowers are small, white, and clustered in corymbs. The fruits, which are aggregate berries, develop from the flowering clusters and are usually dark purple to black when mature. This form is notable for its dense inflorescence, which contributes to its distinctive appearance and ecological role in supporting pollinators and wildlife."
