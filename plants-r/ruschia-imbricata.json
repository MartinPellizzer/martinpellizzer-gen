    "intro": "Ruschia imbricata, commonly known as the sand mat, is a low-growing succulent native to southern Africa. It features dense clusters of small, fleshy, spoon-shaped leaves that form a compact, mat-like structure. The plant produces delicate, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink or purple during the warmer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping."
