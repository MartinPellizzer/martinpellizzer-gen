    "intro": "Renanthera monachica, commonly known as the monk's orchid, is a tropical orchid native to the Caribbean and Central America. It is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that are typically pink or purple with a yellow lip. The plant features a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often humid and tropical environment. Its leaves are broad and elliptical, arranged in a fan-like pattern around the pseudobulb. Renanthera monachica is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
