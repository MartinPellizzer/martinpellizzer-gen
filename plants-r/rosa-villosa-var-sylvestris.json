    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild dog rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its hips, which are the fruit of the plant, are typically orange-red and contain a high concentration of vitamin C. Rosa villosa var. sylvestris is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks, where it thrives in well-drained, acidic soils."
