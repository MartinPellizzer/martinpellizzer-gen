    "intro": "Ramonda serbica f. longipetiolata, commonly known as the long-petioled Serbian bellflower, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Primulaceae family. It is characterized by its elongated petioles, which give it a unique appearance compared to other members of the species. The plant produces bell-shaped, white or pale purple flowers that bloom in early summer. It is typically found in rocky or alpine habitats, often in the Balkan region. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant."
