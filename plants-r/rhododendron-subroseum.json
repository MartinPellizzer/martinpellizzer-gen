    "intro": "Rhododendron subroseum, commonly known as the pink-leaved rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its striking pink to reddish-purple foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the growing season. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
