    "intro": "Rumex maritimus subsp. ochotskius, commonly known as the Ochotsk dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the coastal regions of the Russian Far East and parts of northern Japan. It typically grows in saline or brackish environments, such as tidal flats and coastal marshes. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, erect spikes, and it produces capsules that contain numerous seeds. The species is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds."
