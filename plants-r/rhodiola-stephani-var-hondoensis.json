    "intro": "Rhodiola stephani var. hondoensis, commonly known as the Hondo rhodiola, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of Japan. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves and compact growth habit. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with five petals and numerous stamens, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
