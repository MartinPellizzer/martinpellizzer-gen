    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subdecumbens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Due to its low-growing habit, it forms dense mats that can suppress other vegetation."
