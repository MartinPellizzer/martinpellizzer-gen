    "intro": "Rubus micans var. aestimabilis, commonly known as the velvet raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its dark, almost black fruits that are covered in a fine, velvety bloom, giving it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and thickets. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are thorny. This variety is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible berries, which have a tart, complex flavor."
