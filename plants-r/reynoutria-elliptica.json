    "intro": "Reynoutria elliptica, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along riverbanks and in wetlands. Due to its rapid growth and invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions."
