    "intro": "Rosa pavlovii, commonly known as the Pavlov's rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, and its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves. Rosa pavlovii is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and by horticultural enthusiasts."
