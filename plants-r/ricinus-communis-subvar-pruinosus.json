    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. pruinosus, commonly known as the velvetleaf castor bean, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its distinctive velvety, glandular hairs covering its stems and leaves. This subvariety is native to tropical regions and thrives in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and often have a rough texture due to the presence of these fine, sticky hairs. The plant produces spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in the production of castor oil. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in agricultural settings."
