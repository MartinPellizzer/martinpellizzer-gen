    "intro": "Rubus chlorostachys subsp. elongatifolius, commonly known as the green-stemmed blackberry, is a subshrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and dark green foliage. The leaves are elongated and have a distinctive three-lobed shape, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by edible, tart berries in the summer. This species is well adapted to moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
