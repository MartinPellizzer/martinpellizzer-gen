    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. tomentosifolius, commonly known as the woolly-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence on both the leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a pale underside. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in racemes, while the fruit is a dark purple to black aggregate berry. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
