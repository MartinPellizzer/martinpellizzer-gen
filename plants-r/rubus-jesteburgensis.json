It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
