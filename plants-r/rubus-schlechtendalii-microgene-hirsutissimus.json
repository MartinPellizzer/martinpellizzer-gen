    "intro": "Rubus schlechtendalii microgene hirsutissimus, commonly known as the hairy microgene raspberry. It is a species of bramble characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and small, reddish-black fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions with moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its berries."
