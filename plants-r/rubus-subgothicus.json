    "intro": "Rubus subgothicus, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a shrub native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, dark red berries and prickly stems, which are adaptations to its harsh, cold environment. The plant typically grows in rocky, open habitats and is well-suited to low temperatures and short growing seasons. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the summer. Rubus subgothicus plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil in its fragile habitat."
