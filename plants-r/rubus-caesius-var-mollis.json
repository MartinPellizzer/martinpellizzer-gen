    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. mollis, commonly known as the soft-fleshed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and softer than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for home gardens. The fruit is often used in jams, pies, and other culinary applications due to its rich flavor and high pectin content."
