    "intro": "Rumex acetosa f. pygmaeus, commonly known as the dwarf sorrel, is a low-growing variant of the common sorrel. It is characterized by its small, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This form is notable for its compact size and is often used in ornamental gardening due to its attractive foliage."
