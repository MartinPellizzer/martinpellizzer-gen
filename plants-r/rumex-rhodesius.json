    "intro": "Rumex rhodesius, commonly known as Rhodes sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. Native to southern Africa, it thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible, though they contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
