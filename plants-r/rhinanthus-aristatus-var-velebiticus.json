    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus var. velebiticus, commonly known as the Velebit yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats like grasslands and disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
