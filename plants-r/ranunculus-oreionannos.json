    "intro": "Ranunculus oreionannos, commonly known as the Greek buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Greece. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens, typically blooming in spring. The plant has smooth, hairy, or glandular leaves that are palmately divided, often with three to five leaflets. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a common sight in rocky or woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
