    "intro": "Rubus infestus var. setosus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them popular for jams and pies."
