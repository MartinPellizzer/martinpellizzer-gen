    "intro": "Rubus paludosus, commonly known as the swamp blackberry, is a perennial shrub native to wetland habitats in North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and grows in dense thickets along the edges of ponds and marshes. Its flowers are white and clustered in the axils of the leaves, and it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Rubus paludosus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
