    "intro": "Rubus boudieri, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry shrub, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the eastern United States, particularly in regions with moist, acidic soils. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it has thorny stems that provide structural support. Rubus boudieri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, attracting pollinators and providing habitat for wildlife."
