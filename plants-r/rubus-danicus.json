    "intro": "Rubus danicus, commonly known as the Danish raspberry, is a species of bramble native to northern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental and culinary value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
