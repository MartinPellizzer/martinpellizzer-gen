    "intro": "Rhexia herbacea, commonly known as swamp sunflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetlands and moist woodlands in the eastern United States. It features upright, branching stems that bear clusters of bright yellow to orange flowers, which bloom in late summer. The plant has heart-shaped, toothed leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in poorly drained soils and is often found in swampy areas or along the edges of ponds. Rhexia herbacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
