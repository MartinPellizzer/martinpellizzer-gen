    "intro": "Ruellia superba, commonly known as the purple glorybower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is a perennial shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of purple, blue, or white, which bloom from summer to fall. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by hummingbirds and bees, making it an important species for pollinators. Ruellia superba is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
