    "intro": "Rosa sepium var. malmudariensis, commonly known as the Malmudar rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, with serrated edges that contribute to its distinctive appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
