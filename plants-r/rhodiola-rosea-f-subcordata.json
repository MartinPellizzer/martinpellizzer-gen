    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea f. subcordata, commonly known as the subcordate rose root, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the rhodiola genus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive subcordate (heart-shaped) leaves. This plant is native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and Central Asia, where it thrives in cold, arid environments. It possesses similar adaptogenic properties to other rhodiola species, making it of interest in traditional medicine. However, due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is less commonly cultivated or studied compared to other rhodiola varieties."
