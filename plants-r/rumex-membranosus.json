    "intro": "Rumex membranosus, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herb native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, waxy leaves that are typically narrow and have a distinctive reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender, upright stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, in fields, and near waterways. The leaves and stems are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
