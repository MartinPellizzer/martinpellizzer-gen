    "intro": "Rhododendron viscidum, commonly known as the sticky rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in cool, moist environments at high elevations. The plant is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are often covered in a sticky substance, which gives it its common name. Its flowers are usually pink to purple in color, appearing in clusters and blooming in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron viscidum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
