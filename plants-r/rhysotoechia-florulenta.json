    "intro": "Rhysotoechia florulenta, commonly known as the starlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent petals that emit a soft glow at night, a unique adaptation for attracting nocturnal pollinators. The plant has a complex root system that allows it to thrive in nutrient-poor soil, and its leaves are broad and waxy to reduce water loss. Its flowers bloom in clusters, producing a sweet, intoxicating fragrance that enhances its allure to pollinators. Botanists study this species due to its unusual biological traits and potential medicinal properties."
