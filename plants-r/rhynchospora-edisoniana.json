It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its triangular stems and dense, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its flowering period occurs in late spring to early summer, producing small, inconspicuous flowers that are adapted for wind pollination. Rhynchospora edisoniana plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various invertebrates and birds."
