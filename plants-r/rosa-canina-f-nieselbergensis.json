It is characterized by its distinctive, often double flowers with a rich pink hue. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The fruit, a red hip, develops in autumn and is used in traditional herbal remedies."
