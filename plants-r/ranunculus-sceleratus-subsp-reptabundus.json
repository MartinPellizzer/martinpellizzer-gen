    "intro": "Ranunculus sceleratus subsp. reptabundus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a low-growing habit with a mat-forming structure, and its leaves are divided into three to five lobes. Its flowers are yellow with five petals and are followed by bright orange seed pods that split open to release the seeds. The species is characterized by its rapid spread and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
