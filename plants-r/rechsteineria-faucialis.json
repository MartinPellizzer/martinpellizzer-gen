It is characterized by its striking blue or violet flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in sandy or rocky coastal habitats, where it is adapted to withstand salty air and strong winds. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of salt-excreting glands. Rechsteineria faucialis is a member of the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is often found in maritime environments."
