    "intro": "Rhododendron serrulatum f. mollicum, commonly known as the soft-leaved alpine rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It features dense, dark green foliage that is soft to the touch, distinguishing it from the typical leathery leaves of its species. The plant produces showy, tubular flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained acidic soil, often found in rocky or forested areas. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is commonly cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
