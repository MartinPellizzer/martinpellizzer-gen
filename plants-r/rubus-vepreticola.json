    "intro": "Rubus vepreticola, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and can spread aggressively through vegetative reproduction."
