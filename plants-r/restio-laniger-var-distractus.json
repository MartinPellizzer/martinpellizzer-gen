    "intro": "Restio laniger var. distractus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance with narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny white or pale green flowers. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal or inland fynbos vegetation. Due to its unique morphology and restricted distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
