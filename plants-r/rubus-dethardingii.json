    "intro": "Rubus dethardingii, commonly known as the Detharding blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species within its native habitat."
