    "intro": "Rutaea maculata, commonly known as the spotted rutaea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Rutaea maculata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
