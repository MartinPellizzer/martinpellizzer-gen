    "intro": "Rubus scolocaulon, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs. The plant is adapted to cold climates and has a long growing season, often blooming in late spring and early summer."
