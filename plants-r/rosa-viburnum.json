    "intro": "Rosa viburnum, commonly known as the sweetbriar, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and clusters of small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red or black berries in the fall, which are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Rosa viburnum thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for hedging and ornamental gardening. Its historical use in hedgerows and as a source of fragrance has contributed to its cultural significance."
