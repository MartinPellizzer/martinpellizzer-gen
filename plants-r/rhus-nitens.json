    "intro": "Rhus nitens, commonly known as the coast live oak, is a deciduous evergreen shrub or small tree native to coastal regions of California and Baja California. It has thick, waxy leaves that are typically gray-green in color, and it produces small, yellowish flowers in the spring. The plant is adapted to coastal conditions, including salt spray and strong winds, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Rhus nitens is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and attractive foliage. It plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for local wildlife."
