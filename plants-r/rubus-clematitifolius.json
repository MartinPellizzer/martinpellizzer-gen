    "intro": "Rubus clematitifolius, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruit, it is both cultivated and wild in its native habitat."
