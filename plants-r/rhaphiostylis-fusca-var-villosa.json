It belongs to the Araceae family, characterized by its unique inflorescence structure consisting of a spadix surrounded by a spathe. The plant is distinguished by its hairy texture on its leaves and stems, which gives it its varietal name \"villosa.\" It produces small, greenish-white flowers that are typically clustered together on the spadix. This species is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands."
