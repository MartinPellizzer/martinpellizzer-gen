    "intro": "Rhinanthus subulatus, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. This plant typically grows in grasslands and open woodlands, often in nutrient-poor soils. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, and it is known for its bright, showy appearance. Rhinanthus subulatus plays a role in supporting pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
