    "intro": "Rhamnella gilgitica, commonly known as the Gilgit Rhamnus, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth upper surface and a hairy underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by small, fleshy berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in rocky and arid environments, often found at elevations above 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
