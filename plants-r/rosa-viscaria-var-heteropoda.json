    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. heteropoda, commonly known as the hairy rose or the bristly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and hairy leaves, which help it retain moisture in arid environments. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a red, hairy rosehip, which contains seeds used in traditional medicine. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature in cooler climates."
