    "intro": "Ribes glaciale f. angustisepalum, commonly known as the narrow-sepaled white currant, is a botanical variant of the white currant species. It is characterized by its narrow, elongated sepals that distinguish it from the typical form of Ribes glaciale. The plant is a deciduous shrub, typically found in alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, with five narrow sepals and five petals. It produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to regular currants but are often less commonly cultivated."
