    "intro": "Rubus micans var. heterochrooides, commonly known as the variable everlet, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed, doubly serrate leaves that vary in coloration, often displaying a mix of green, red, and purple hues. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in rich, acidic soils. This variant is notable for its variability in leaf color and morphology, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
