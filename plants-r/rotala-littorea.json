    "intro": "Rotala littorea, commonly known as water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It has broad, waxy, heart-shaped leaves that form a rosette at the water's surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Rotala littorea is often found in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. It is valued in aquariums for its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide oxygen and shelter for aquatic life."
