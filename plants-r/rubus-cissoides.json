It is a perennial shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically black when mature, though they may remain green or red depending on the variety. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are usually serrated and covered in fine hairs. Rubus cissoides thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in shaded, damp areas along stream banks."
