    "intro": "Rorippa lippizensis, commonly known as the Lippizens water-cress, is a small flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many other mustard plants. The plant typically grows in moist, rocky habitats and has small, alternate leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in racemes, and it produces small, round seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
