    "intro": "Rubus erythrostachys var. hirtissimus, commonly known as the hairy evergreen bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a hairy texture, giving the plant its common name. This species is often found in moist, shaded forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid climates. Its fruit, a small, red berry, is edible but generally not cultivated for commercial use."
