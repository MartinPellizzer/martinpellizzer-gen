    "intro": "Retama angulata, commonly known as angular retama, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its angular, often thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, bean-like pods that contain seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for rocky or arid environments. Botanically, it belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is known for its ability to fix nitrogen in the soil."
