It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, thorny growth habit. The leaves are typically leathery and have a rough texture, which is a defining feature of the sclerophyllus variety. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, followed by edible berries that are usually dark purple to black in color. This plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats."
