    "intro": "Rottboellia uniflora, commonly known as the single-flower grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, erect stems that bear a single spikelet at the top. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically wind-pollinated, and its seeds are dispersed by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Rottboellia uniflora is valued for its ornamental potential and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine, grass-like foliage."
