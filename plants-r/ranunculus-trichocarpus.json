    "intro": "Ranunculus trichocarpus, commonly known as the Himalayan buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It features a slender, upright stem that can grow up to 60 cm in height, adorned with trifoliate or pinnate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in spring. Its roots are fibrous and often used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties. Ranunculus trichocarpus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and forested areas."
