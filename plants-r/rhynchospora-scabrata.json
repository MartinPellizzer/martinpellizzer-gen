    "intro": "Rhynchospora scabrata, commonly known as the roughleaf flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are rough to the touch, giving it its common name. Its flowering spikes are usually borne on tall, erect stems and produce small, inconspicuous flowers. Rhynchospora scabrata plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
