It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which provides a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a serrated margin. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
