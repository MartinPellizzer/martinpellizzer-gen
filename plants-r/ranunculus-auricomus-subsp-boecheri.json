    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. boecheri, commonly known as the Sierra golden cinquefoil, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly habitats, often in alpine or subalpine regions. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
