    "intro": "Richardia rossii, commonly known as the Mexican morning glory, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and Central America. It is a herbaceous annual that produces striking violet to blue flowers with a distinctive white throat. The plant has heart-shaped leaves and is often found growing in moist, open areas such as fields and stream banks. Its flowers open in the morning and close by midday, hence its common name. Richardia rossii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
