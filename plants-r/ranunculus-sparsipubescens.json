    "intro": "Ranunculus sparsipubescens, commonly known as the sparse-hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately lobed leaves with a hairy texture, and its flowers are typically yellow with prominent, showy sepals. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high elevations. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
