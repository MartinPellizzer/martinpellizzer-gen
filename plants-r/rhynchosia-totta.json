    "intro": "Rhynchosia totta, commonly known as the red-veined morning glory, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with distinctive red veins and produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. The plant is characterized by its fibrous, woody stems and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Its seeds are enclosed in a hairy, pod-like fruit that splits open when mature. Rhynchosia totta is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used traditionally in some cultures for medicinal purposes."
