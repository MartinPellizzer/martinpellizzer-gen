    "intro": "Rhododendron neriifolium, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features striking, large, showy flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of pink to red. The plant has elliptical, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant blossoms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its role in traditional Chinese medicine."
