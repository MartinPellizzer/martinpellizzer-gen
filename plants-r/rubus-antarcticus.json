    "intro": "Rubus antarcticus, commonly known as the Antarctic bramble, is a shrub native to the southern regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its berries are edible but typically have a tart flavor. Due to its hardy nature, it is adapted to survive in cold, high-altitude environments."
