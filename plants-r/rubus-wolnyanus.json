    "intro": "Rubus wolnyanus, commonly known as the Wolnyan blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern Russia and parts of northern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied member of the Rubus genus."
