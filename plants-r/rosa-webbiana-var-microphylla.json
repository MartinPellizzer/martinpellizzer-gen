    "intro": "Rosa webbiana var. microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its compact shrub form and dense growth habit, making it well-suited for rocky or well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
