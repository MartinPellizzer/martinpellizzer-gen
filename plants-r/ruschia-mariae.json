    "intro": "Ruschia mariae, commonly known as the Cape marigold, is a flowering plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Aizoaceae family and is characterized by its compact, succulent growth habit. The plant produces vibrant yellow or orange flowers that bloom in spring and summer. Its leaves are typically fleshy and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ruschia mariae is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments due to its drought tolerance."
