    "intro": "Ranunculus peltatus var. heterophyllus, commonly known as the heterophyllous buttercup, is a variant of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae) characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology. This plant typically features palmately lobed leaves that vary in shape depending on environmental conditions, a trait known as heterophylly. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks, where it forms dense, herbaceous growth. The flowers are usually yellow with five petals, and they bloom in early spring. Its botanical significance lies in its morphological adaptability, making it an interesting subject for studies on plant plasticity."
