    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. billotiana, commonly known as the Billot's woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to southern China and northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It prefers well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight, often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual and aromatic qualities."
