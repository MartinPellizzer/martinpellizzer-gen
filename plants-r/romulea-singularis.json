    "intro": "Romulea singularis, commonly known as the singular glory-of-the-sun, is a striking bulbous plant native to South Africa. It features showy, orange-yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. The plant has a fibrous root system and produces small, rounded bulbs that store nutrients for the next growing season. Its leaves are grass-like and often withered during the dormant period. Romulea singularis is adapted to dry, sunny environments and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth."
