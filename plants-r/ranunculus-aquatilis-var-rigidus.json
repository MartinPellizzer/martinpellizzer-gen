    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater habitats in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, such as ponds, streams, and lakes, where it forms dense colonies. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged, with small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are divided into narrow, thread-like segments, which help reduce water resistance. This variety is characterized by its rigid, upright growth habit, distinguishing it from other varieties of water crowfoot."
