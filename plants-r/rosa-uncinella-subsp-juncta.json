    "intro": "Rosa uncinella subsp. juncta, commonly known as the hooked rose or the creeping rose, is a shrub-like species native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The subspecies juncta is distinguished by its more compact growth habit and shorter, hooked thorns compared to the typical form of Rosa uncinella."
