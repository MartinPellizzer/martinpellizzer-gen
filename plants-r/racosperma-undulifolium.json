    "intro": "Racosperma undulifolium, commonly known as the undulating-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Australia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive undulating or wavy edge, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Racosperma undulifolium is adapted to thrive in low-nutrient soils and is often found in coastal and inland dunes."
