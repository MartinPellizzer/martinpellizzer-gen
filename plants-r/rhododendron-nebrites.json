    "intro": "Rhododendron nebrites, commonly known as the purple laurel, is a species of evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, humid climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its fragrant blooms, which appear in late spring to early summer. Rhododendron nebrites is also valued for its ability to form thickets, providing habitat for various wildlife species."
