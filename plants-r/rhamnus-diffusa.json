    "intro": "Rhamnus diffusa, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in the fall. It is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions. The bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used historically in traditional medicine."
