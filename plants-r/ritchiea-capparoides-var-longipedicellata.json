    "intro": "Ritchiea capparoides var. longipedicellata, commonly known as the long-stalked Ritchiea, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of New Guinea. It belongs to the family Cyclanthaceae, characterized by its distinctive floral structures and leaf morphology. The plant features elongated pedicels that support its small, white to pale green flowers, which are often clustered in inflorescences. Its leaves are typically broad and elliptical, with a smooth surface and a waxy texture. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native environment."
