    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. hermaphrodita, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 9 pairs of leaflets, and its distinctive reddish-orange fruit clusters that appear in late summer. The plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female flowers are found on separate plants, though some individuals may exhibit hermaphroditic traits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in well-drained soils in full sun. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it a valuable species in ecological restoration projects."
