    "intro": "Rubus discerptus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in shaded conditions."
