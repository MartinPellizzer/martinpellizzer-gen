It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers have numerous sepals that resemble petals. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
