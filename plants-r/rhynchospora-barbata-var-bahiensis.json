It is characterized by its erect, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the Cyperaceae family. It thrives in wetland or marshy habitats, often forming dense colonies in shallow water or moist soil. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive bristled inflorescence and is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying wetland ecosystems."
