    "intro": "Rochelia strigosa, commonly known as the woolly rockrose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, silver-gray foliage covered in fine, woolly hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of yellow to orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and coastal landscapes. Rochelia strigosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
