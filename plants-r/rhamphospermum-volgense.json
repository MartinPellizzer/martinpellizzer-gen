    "intro": "Rhamphospermum volgense, commonly known as the Volga beard lichen, is a member of the Lecanoraceae family. It is a crustose lichen that typically grows on bark and soil in temperate regions. The thallus is lecanorine, with a distinct upper cortex and a medulla composed of fungal hyphae. It has a pale to dark yellowish-orange coloration due to the presence of usnic acid. This lichen is often found in forested areas and is used as an indicator species for environmental health."
