It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are usually oval to elliptic in shape, with a serrated margin and a hairy underside. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of forests."
