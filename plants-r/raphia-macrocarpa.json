    "intro": "Raphia macrocarpa, commonly known as the African fan palm, is a large, tropical palm native to West and Central Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in diameter. The plant produces large, yellowish-orange inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, facilitating wind pollination. Its fruit is a three-lobed, fibrous structure that contains a single seed, and it plays a significant role in local ecosystems and traditional practices. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in construction and crafts."
