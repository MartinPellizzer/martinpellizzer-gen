It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, grey bark and simple, alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody fruits that contain toxic seeds. It is often found in lowland forests and is valued for its timber, although its toxic properties limit its use."
