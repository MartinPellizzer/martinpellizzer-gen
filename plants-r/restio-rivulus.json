    "intro": "Restio rivulus, commonly known as the river restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with slender, cylindrical stems. The plant typically grows in wet, sandy soils near rivers and streams, thriving in moist environments. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually clustered at the base of the plant, and it produces lightweight seeds that are dispersed by the wind. Restio rivulus plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
