    "intro": "Rostellaria vahlii, commonly known as the Vahli's rostellaria, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest understories or along stream banks. Its leaves are linear and arranged in a spiral pattern around the stem. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
