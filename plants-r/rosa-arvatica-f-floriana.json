It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage, often forming a rounded shrub. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the alpine regions of Europe and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
