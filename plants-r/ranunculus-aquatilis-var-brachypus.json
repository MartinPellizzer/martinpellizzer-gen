It typically grows in shallow water or damp soils, often found in ponds, marshes, and stream edges. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are usually deeply lobed and floating or submerged. It has a short, stout stem that supports its buoyant leaves and showy blooms. This variety is notable for its adaptation to aquatic environments and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
