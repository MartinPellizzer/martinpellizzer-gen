    "intro": "Robsonia, commonly known as the African violet, is a genus of flowering plants native to southern Africa. These plants are characterized by their dense, velvety foliage and showy, tubular flowers that come in a variety of colors. Robsonia species typically grow as small shrubs or herbaceous plants, often with a compact growth habit. They prefer well-drained soil and bright, indirect light, making them popular houseplants. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly sunbirds, which are attracted to their nectar-rich blooms."
