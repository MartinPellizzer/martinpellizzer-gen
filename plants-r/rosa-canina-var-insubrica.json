    "intro": "Rosa canina var. insubrica, commonly known as the Italian rose or wild dog rose, is a variety of the dog rose native to southern Europe. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by orange-red hips, the fruit of the plant. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional herbal medicine. The species is adapted to a wide range of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands."
