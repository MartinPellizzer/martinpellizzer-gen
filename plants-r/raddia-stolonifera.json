    "intro": "Raddia stolonifera, commonly known as the creeping raddia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, white or pale pink flowers clustered in racemes, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a soft texture. Raddia stolonifera is often found in dry, rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
