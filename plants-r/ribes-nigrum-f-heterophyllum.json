    "intro": "Ribes nigrum f. heterophyllum, commonly known as the blackcurrant hybrid or blackcurrant variant, is a cultivar of the blackcurrant plant. It is characterized by its distinct foliage, with leaves that are smaller and more variable in shape compared to the typical blackcurrant. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard blackcurrant. It is often grown for its ornamental value as well as for its edible fruits. This form is valued in horticulture for its adaptability and aesthetic appeal."
