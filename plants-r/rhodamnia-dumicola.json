    "intro": "Rhodamnia dumicola, commonly known as the coastal hakea, is a shrub native to southern Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and dense, needle-like leaves that are adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing seeds. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in coastal heathlands. Rhodamnia dumicola is a hardy species that plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
