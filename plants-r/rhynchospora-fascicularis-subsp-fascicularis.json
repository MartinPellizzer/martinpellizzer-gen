    "intro": "Rhynchospora fascicularis subsp. fascicularis, commonly known as the fasciated flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense colonies. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple in color. Its inflorescence is a spike-like structure with bracts that are often broader than the flowers themselves. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive fasciated (striped) leaves, which give it its common name."
