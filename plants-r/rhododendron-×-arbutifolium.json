    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 arbutifolium, commonly known as the bearberry-leaved rhododendron, is a hybrid plant that exhibits characteristics of both rhododendrons and arbutus. It features broad, leathery leaves that resemble those of the bearberry plant, giving it its common name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring. It is typically found in temperate regions with acidic soils and partial shade. Its botanical interest lies in its hybrid nature and ornamental value in gardens."
