    "intro": "Ranunculus hirtus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features erect, hairy stems that bear palmate, bright yellow flowers with numerous small, rounded petals. The leaves are trifoliate, with a rough, hairy texture that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. The plant is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy, often toxic flowers."
