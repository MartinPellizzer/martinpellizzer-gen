    "intro": "Ranunculus ternatus var. hirsutus, commonly known as the hairy water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow waters, wet meadows, and along stream edges, where it thrives in moist, often calcareous soils. The plant features small, delicate flowers with five sepals and numerous stamens, often in shades of yellow or white. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive hairy texture that gives it its common name. The hairy water crowfoot plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
