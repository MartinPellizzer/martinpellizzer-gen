    "intro": "Rubia ramosissima var. hispida, commonly known as hairy woodruff, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its creeping growth habit and dense, mat-forming structure. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in clusters along the stems. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant is often used in traditional herbal medicine and as a ground cover in gardens due to its ornamental value and low maintenance requirements."
