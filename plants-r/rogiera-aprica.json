    "intro": "Rogiera aprica, commonly known as the spring broom, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, yellowish-green foliage and small, inconspicuous flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and dry landscapes. Its growth habit is compact, with a spreading habit that forms a low, mat-like structure. Rogiera aprica is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
