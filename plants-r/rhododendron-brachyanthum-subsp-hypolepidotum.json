It typically grows at elevations between 2,000 and 3,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense clusters of bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with acidic, well-drained soil."
