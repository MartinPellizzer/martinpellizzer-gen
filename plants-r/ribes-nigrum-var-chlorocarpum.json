    "intro": "Ribes nigrum var. chlorocarpum, commonly known as the yellow currant, is a variant of the black currant species native to North America. It is characterized by its yellow berries, which are smaller and less tart compared to the typical black currant. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the distinctive yellow fruit. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruit. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, contributing to its visual appeal."
