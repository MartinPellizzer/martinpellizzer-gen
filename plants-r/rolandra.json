    "intro": "Rolandra, commonly known as the sacred lotus, is a genus of aquatic and semi-aquatic flowering plants native to tropical and subtropical regions. It belongs to the family Nymphaeaceae and is characterized by its showy, water-lily-like flowers that float on the surface of still or slow-moving water. The plant has thick, fleshy roots that anchor it in muddy substrates, while its broad, waxy leaves provide buoyancy. Rolandra species are known for their ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and are often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of rivers. The flowers typically open in the morning and close at dusk, a behavior that has been associated with spiritual symbolism in various cultures."
