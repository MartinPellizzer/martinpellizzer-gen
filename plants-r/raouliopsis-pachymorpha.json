    "intro": "Raouliopsis pachymorpha, commonly known as the thick-leaved raouliopsis, is a shrub native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its thick, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in spring. Its growth habit is compact, with multiple stems that form a dense, bushy appearance. Raouliopsis pachymorpha is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, showing resilience to harsh weather conditions."
