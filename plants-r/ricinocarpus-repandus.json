It is characterized by its palmate leaves, which are typically broad and deeply lobed. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in racemose inflorescences, and its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds. It thrives in moist, sunny environments and is often found in savannas and along riverbanks. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional medicine in some regions."
