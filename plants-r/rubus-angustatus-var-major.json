    "intro": "Rubus angustatus var. major, commonly known as the large-leaf bramble, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with elongated, pointed leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
