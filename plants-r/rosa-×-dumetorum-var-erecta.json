    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. erecta, commonly known as the upright dog rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which distinguish it from its climbing relatives. The plant produces small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
