    "intro": "Ricinocarpus parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved ricin tree, is a flowering plant native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant produces a milky latex, which contains toxic compounds, including ricin, making it potentially dangerous. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, often found in lowland forests and along riverbanks. Due to its toxic properties, it is typically avoided for cultivation or use in traditional medicine."
