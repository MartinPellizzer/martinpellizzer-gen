    "intro": "Roezliella ibis, commonly known as the ibis orchid, is a member of the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that resemble the beak of an ibis, hence its common name. It typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid, shaded environments. The botanical features of Roezliella ibis include long, slender stems and lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle."
