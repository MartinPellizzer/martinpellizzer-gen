    "intro": "Robinia ferruginea, commonly known as the honey locust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves that turn yellow in the fall and its thorned stems, which are often used in ornamental landscaping. The plant produces small, green pods that contain several seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Its flowers, which are pale yellow and fragrant, bloom in late spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The tree is also valued for its hard, heavy wood, which has been historically used for tool handles and other durable items."
