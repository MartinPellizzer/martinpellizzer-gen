    "intro": "Rubus subimbricatus, commonly known as the prickly raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe, attracting various pollinators and wildlife. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and they are often covered in fine hairs. Rubus subimbricatus plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, providing food and shelter for numerous animal species."
