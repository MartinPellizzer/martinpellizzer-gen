    "intro": "Rubus fictus microgene saltuivagus, commonly known as the silverleaf raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the temperate regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy, silvery leaves that give it its common name. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
