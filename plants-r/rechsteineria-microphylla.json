    "intro": "Rechsteineria microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaf rechsteineria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family, which includes many epiphytic and terrestrial species. The plant is characterized by its compact rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that form a water-holding cup, typical of bromeliads. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are usually green or white, emerging from the center of the rosette. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
