    "intro": "Ribes petraeum var. tomentosum, commonly known as the hairy currant, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, often used in local cuisines. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
