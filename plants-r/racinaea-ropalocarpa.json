    "intro": "Racinaea ropalocarpa, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive epiphytic plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, white, spider-like flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant lacks true leaves and instead absorbs nutrients through its roots, which are adapted to cling to tree trunks in humid, shaded environments. Its unique morphology and habitat requirements make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered endangered in many regions."
