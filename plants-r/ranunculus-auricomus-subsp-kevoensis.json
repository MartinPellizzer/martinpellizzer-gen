    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. kevoensis, commonly known as the Kevo buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the northern regions of Europe and parts of Siberia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with a distinctive, slightly reflexed petal arrangement. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in alpine or subalpine meadows. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that aids in water retention. This subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate, early spring blooms."
