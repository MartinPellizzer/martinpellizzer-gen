It is characterized by its fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has arching, thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedges and garden borders. Its historical use in perfumery and as a source of rosehip fruit adds to its botanical significance."
