    "intro": "Rhinanthus versicolor, commonly known as the common yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe, North Africa, and western Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges, often in well-drained soils. Its bright yellow flowers, which bloom from June to August, are clustered in whorls along the stem, attracting various pollinators. Rhinanthus versicolor is also known for its ecological importance in supporting insect populations and its role in soil stabilization."
