    "intro": "Rapanea novocaledonica var. mueoensis, commonly known as the Mueo rapanea, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Ericaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and small, clustered flowers. The leaves are typically elliptical with a leathery texture, and the plant produces berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the understorey of humid forests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
