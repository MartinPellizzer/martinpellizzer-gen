    "intro": "Rhododendron dichroanthum subsp. septentrionale, commonly known as the northern alpine rhododendron, is a rare and specialized plant species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. This subspecies thrives in cool, moist, and acidic soils, often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its growth is typically low and compact, forming dense shrubs that are well adapted to harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered plant in its native range."
