    "intro": "Rubus histricosus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry bush, is a species of flowering plant in the\u8537\u8587\u79d1 (Rosaceae) family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are usually dark purple to black in color when ripe. These fruits are edible, though they are often covered in a fine, fuzzy layer that can be unpleasant to eat. Rubus histricosus is native to various regions in Europe, Asia, and North America, and it thrives in a variety of soil types and climates."
