    "intro": "Rhysolepis, commonly known as the silverleaf maple, is a species of maple native to North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silver-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant has a broad, spreading canopy and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. Its fruits are samaras, which are winged seeds that aid in wind dispersal. Rhysolepis is often found in moist, well-drained soils in forested areas."
