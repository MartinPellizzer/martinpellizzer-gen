    "intro": "Rubus jamaicensis alpinus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
