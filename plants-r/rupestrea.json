    "intro": "Rupestrea, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is characterized by its epiphytic or lithophytic growth habit, often found growing on rocks or trees in tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have narrow, strap-like leaves and produce showy, fragrant flowers in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and purple. Rupestrea species are adapted to grow in nutrient-poor environments, relying on their ability to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. They are popular among orchid enthusiasts for their unique appearance and relatively easy care requirements."
