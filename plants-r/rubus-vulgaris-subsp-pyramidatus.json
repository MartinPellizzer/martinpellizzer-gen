    "intro": "Rubus vulgaris subsp. pyramidatus, commonly known as the bramble or blackberry bush, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible, though the stems and leaves contain irritants. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
