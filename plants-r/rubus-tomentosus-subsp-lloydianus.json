It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, white to pale pink flowers. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces edible, red berries in the fall. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the main species."
