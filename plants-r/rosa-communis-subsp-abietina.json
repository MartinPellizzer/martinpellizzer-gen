It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, thriving in cooler climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and alpine settings."
