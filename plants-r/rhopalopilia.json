    "intro": "Rhopalopilia, commonly known as the \"Bishop's Cap\" or \"Lion's Head,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are characterized by their striking, spherical flower heads that resemble a bishop's cap, composed of tightly packed yellow ray florets. Rhopalopilia species are native to southern Africa, particularly in countries like South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana. They typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are often found in mountainous or arid regions. The genus includes several species, such as Rhopalopilia corymbosa and Rhopalopilia glabrata, which are valued for their ornamental beauty and adaptability to various climates."
