    "intro": "Rubus hypoleucus, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of brambles native to western North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across various habitats. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically consumed by wildlife and birds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories or along stream banks."
