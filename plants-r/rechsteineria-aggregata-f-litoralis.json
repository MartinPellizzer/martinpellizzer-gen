    "intro": "Rechsteineria aggregata f. litoralis, commonly known as the coastal form of the clustered rechsteineria, is a rare and specialized plant adapted to coastal environments. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and succulent leaves, which help it retain moisture in salty, windy conditions. The plant typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, where it is exposed to salt spray and fluctuating tides. Its flowers are small and clustered, often appearing in shades of pink or white, and it blooms during the warmer months. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
