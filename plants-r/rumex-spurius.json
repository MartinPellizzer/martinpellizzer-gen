    "intro": "Rumex spurius, commonly known as common dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, while the upper leaves are more narrow and have a waxy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming from June to August. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and colonize moist, disturbed soils. It is often found along roadsides, in wet meadows, and in other damp environments."
