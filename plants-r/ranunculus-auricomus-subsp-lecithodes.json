    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. lecithodes, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often with a distinctive golden hue. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its leaves are deeply divided into lobes, and it produces small, green, globose fruits. The subspecies lecithodes is distinguished by its slightly different floral morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form."
