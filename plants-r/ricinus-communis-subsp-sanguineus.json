    "intro": "Ricinus communis subsp. sanguineus, commonly known as the crimson cup plant, is a herbaceous annual plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmate leaves that are often red-veined and have a velvety texture. The plant produces spiky, red or orange seed capsules that contain toxic, oily seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, often growing in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value and toxic properties, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens but requires caution during handling."
