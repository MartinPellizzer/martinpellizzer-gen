    "intro": "Rokautskyia scaposa, commonly known as the slender scapose orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, slender stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces pale yellow or greenish-white flowers, often arranged in a raceme, which bloom during the summer months. It thrives in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
