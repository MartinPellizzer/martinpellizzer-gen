    "intro": "Rubus radula subsp. uncinatus, commonly known as the hooked bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy berries. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it is considered a potential invasive species in some regions."
