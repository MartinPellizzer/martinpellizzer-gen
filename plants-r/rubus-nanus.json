    "intro": "Rubus nanus, commonly known as dwarf blackberry, is a small shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically small and hairy. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blackberries but are often less sweet. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
