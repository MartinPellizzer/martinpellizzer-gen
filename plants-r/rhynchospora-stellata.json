    "intro": "Rhynchospora stellata, commonly known as star sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and marshy areas in North America. It features slender, grass-like stems that grow from rhizomes, and its leaves are typically narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pale green to reddish in color, arranged in spikelets. Rhynchospora stellata is often found in disturbed wetland habitats and is adapted to tolerate fluctuating water levels. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wetland organisms."
