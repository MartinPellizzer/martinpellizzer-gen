    "intro": "Rhamnicastrum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rutaceae. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, dark berries that are a food source for various birds and animals. Rhamnicastrum species are native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa, and they often thrive in disturbed soils and woodland edges. Due to its invasive tendencies in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
