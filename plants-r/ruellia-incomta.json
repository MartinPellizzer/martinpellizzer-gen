It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue, typically blooming during the warmer months. Ruellia incomta thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as butterflies and bees."
