    "intro": "Roegneria ciliaris var. submutica, commonly known as the rough meadowgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves with a rough, hairy texture along the edges. The plant produces dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its fibrous roots contribute to soil stabilization, making it ecologically significant in wetland ecosystems."
