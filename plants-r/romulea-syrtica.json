It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often violet or pink, tubular flowers. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it conserve water in its harsh environment. Romulea syrtica produces underground bulbs that store nutrients and moisture, allowing it to survive long dry periods. It is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to full sun exposure."
