    "intro": "Rosa canina psilophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dog rose, is a species of shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically narrow and have a leathery texture, which helps the plant conserve water in its natural habitat. Its fruit, known as a hip, is orange-red and contains several seeds, often used in traditional medicine. This plant is well adapted to dry, sunny environments and is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils."
