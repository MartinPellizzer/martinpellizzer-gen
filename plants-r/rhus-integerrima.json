    "intro": "Rhus integerrima, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Smooth sumac is often found in open woods, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils. It has medicinal uses and is also valued for its ornamental qualities in landscaping."
