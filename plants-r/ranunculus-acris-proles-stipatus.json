    "intro": "Ranunculus acris proles stipatus, commonly known as the hairy bittercress, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features small, delicate flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant has heart-shaped, lobed leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its rapid growth and prolific seed production make it an invasive species in many regions outside its native range."
