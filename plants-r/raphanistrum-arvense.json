    "intro": "Raphanistrum arvense, commonly known as common smartweed, is an annual herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides, fields, and waste areas, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. The plant features alternate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it has a fibrous root system that allows it to thrive in a variety of soil conditions. Raphanistrum arvense is often considered a weed but is also valued for its nutritional content and traditional medicinal uses."
