    "intro": "Racinaea spiculosa var. ustulata, commonly known as the flame leaf fern, is a tropical plant native to the rainforests of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking, brightly colored foliage, which ranges from red to orange and yellow, giving it its common name. The plant has a rhizomatous growth habit, with dense clusters of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle. Its botanical features include small, clustered inflorescences that produce inconspicuous flowers, followed by spore-bearing structures. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in shaded garden environments."
