    "intro": "Rhynchostele hortensiae, commonly known as the pink-root fern, is a striking tropical plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, fiddlehead-like fronds that unfurl into a lush, feathery appearance. The plant features a rhizomatous growth habit, with a central, swollen rhynchostele that serves as the vascular core. Its leaves are typically bright green with a waxy texture, and it produces small, inconspicuous spore-bearing structures on the underside of its fronds. Rhynchostele hortensiae is often cultivated for its ornamental value and thrives in humid, shaded environments."
