    "intro": "Roupala heterophylla var. variifolia, commonly known as the variable-leaf roupala, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its diverse leaf shapes, which vary from ovate to elliptic. The plant produces small, white to cream-colored flowers arranged in dense, spherical clusters. Its leaves are typically alternate and can be either simple or lobed, depending on the growth conditions. This variability in morphology makes it an interesting subject for botanical study and horticultural cultivation."
