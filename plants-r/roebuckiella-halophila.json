It belongs to the family Amaranthaceae and is characterized by its succulent leaves and robust root system. The plant exhibits a shrub-like growth habit with small, fleshy leaves that help reduce water loss. It is native to coastal and arid regions where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Roebuckiella halophila is valued for its ability to tolerate high salinity and is often used in phytoremediation efforts."
