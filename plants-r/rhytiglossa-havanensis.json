    "intro": "Rhytiglossa havanensis, commonly known as the Havana orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Caribbean, specifically Cuba. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that display a unique combination of colors, often with a deep purple or violet hue. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, such as forest understories or rocky crevices. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the limited soil available in its habitat. Rhytiglossa havanensis is valued not only for its ornamental beauty but also for its ecological role in supporting local biodiversity."
