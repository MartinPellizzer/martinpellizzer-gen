    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. major, commonly known as the white-bracted raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white bracts that distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem with thorny growth."
