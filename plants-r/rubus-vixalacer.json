    "intro": "Rubus vixalacer, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It features compound leaves with a distinctive silvery underside, which helps reflect sunlight and reduce water loss. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its flowers are white and arranged in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
