    "intro": "Rhododendron flavantherum, commonly known as the yellow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking yellowish-green foliage and clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are often leathery and have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron flavantherum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
