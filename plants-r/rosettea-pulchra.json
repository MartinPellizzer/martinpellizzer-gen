    "intro": "Rosettea pulchra, commonly known as the beauty rosette, is a striking member of the Bromeliaceae family. It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant is characterized by its compact, rosette-shaped leaves that form a dense, water-holding cup at the center. These leaves are typically bright green with intricate patterns and a waxy texture. Rosettea pulchra thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot."
