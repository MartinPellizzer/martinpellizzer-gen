    "intro": "Rubus egregiusculus, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, bramble-like growth habit and clusters of small, edible berries. The plant typically thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals, and it produces fruits that are similar in taste to regular raspberries. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species in certain regions."
