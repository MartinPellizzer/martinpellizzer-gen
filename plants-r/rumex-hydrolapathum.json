    "intro": "Rumex hydrolapathum, commonly known as water sorrel, is a perennial herb native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically visited by various pollinators. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize moist soils effectively. Rumex hydrolapathum is often found in marshes, stream banks, and other aquatic or semi-aquatic environments."
