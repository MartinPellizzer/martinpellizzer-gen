    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy redleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant red foliage, which becomes more pronounced in autumn, and its clusters of fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with multiple stems, and its leaves are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it the \"pubescens\" variety name. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable candidate for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens for its striking appearance and seasonal color changes."
