    "intro": "Roegneria scabridula, commonly known as the roughleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves with a rough, scabrous texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in dry, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and steppe environments. Roegneria scabridula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
