    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. fenarolii, commonly known as the Fenarolii blue rose, is a cultivar of the species Rosa glauca, which is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. This form is characterized by its striking pale blue to violet flowers, a unique coloration resulting from a genetic mutation affecting pigmentation. The plant typically grows as a shrub with arching, thorny stems and pinnate leaves with serrated edges. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy yet ornamental addition to gardens. Due to its rarity and distinctive appearance, it is highly valued by horticulturists and botanical enthusiasts."
