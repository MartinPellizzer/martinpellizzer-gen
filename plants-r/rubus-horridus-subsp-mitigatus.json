    "intro": "Rubus horridus subsp. mitigatus, commonly known as the soft-hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible and have a sweet-tart flavor, often used in culinary applications. The subspecies is distinguished by its less prickly stems and softer foliage compared to other Rubus species."
