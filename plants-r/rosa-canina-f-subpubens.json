    "intro": "Rosa canina f. subpubens, commonly known as the hairy rose dogwood, is a botanical variant of the common dogwood. It is characterized by its dense, glandular pubescence on the stems and leaves, which distinguishes it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It is native to Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits to wildlife."
