    "intro": "Rubus alexeterius var. alexeterius, commonly known as the Alexander's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally endemic species."
