It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves with sharply toothed margins and small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems are armed with stout, curved prickles, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring.
