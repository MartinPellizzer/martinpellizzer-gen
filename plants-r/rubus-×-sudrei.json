    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 sudrei, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry), resulting in a plant that exhibits traits of both parent species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, with a tart flavor. Its stems are covered in stiff, prickly hairs, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Rubus \u00d7 sudrei is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
