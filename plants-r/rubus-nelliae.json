    "intro": "Rubus nelliae, commonly known as the Nellie's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple berries that are often used in jams and preserves. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
