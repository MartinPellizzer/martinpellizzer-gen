    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 collina var. coriifolia, commonly known as the silky rose, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and its ability to thrive in well-drained, alkaline soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, which are often followed by red, fuzzy fruits. Its leaves are covered in a fine, silvery-white down, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its aesthetic appeal and hardiness."
