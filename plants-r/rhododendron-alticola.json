    "intro": "Rhododendron alticola, commonly known as the highland rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows at elevations above 1,500 meters, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron alticola is often found in forests and rocky habitats, contributing to the biodiversity of its native ecosystems."
