    "intro": "Rendlia, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, velvety hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are often green or yellow in color. Rendlia thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and abandoned fields. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and rhizomes make it an invasive species in many areas."
