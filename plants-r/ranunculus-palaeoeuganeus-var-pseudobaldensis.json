    "intro": "Ranunculus palaeoeuganeus var. pseudobaldensis, commonly known as the pseudobalden's buttercup, is a rare and ancient plant species with a distinctive botanical profile. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant is typically found in calcareous soils and is adapted to specific microhabitats, often in mountainous regions. Its morphology reflects evolutionary traits that suggest a connection to its fossil relatives. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable indicator of past environmental conditions."
