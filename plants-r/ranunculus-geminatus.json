    "intro": "Ranunculus geminatus, commonly known as the twinleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves composed of three heart-shaped leaflets and produces delicate yellow flowers with five to nine sepals. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is often found in association with other wetland flora. Ranunculus geminatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in supporting local insect populations."
