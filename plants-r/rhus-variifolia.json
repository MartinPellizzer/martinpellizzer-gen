    "intro": "Rhus variifolia, commonly known as the variable sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have varying leaflets along their length, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, clustered yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it often has a sprawling growth habit. Rhus variifolia is adapted to a variety of soil types and is commonly found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
