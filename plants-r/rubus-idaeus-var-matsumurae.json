It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than the standard red raspberry."
