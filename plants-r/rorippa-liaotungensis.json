    "intro": "Rorippa liaotungensis, commonly known as the Liaotung watercress, is a small annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its alternate, pinnately lobed leaves and small, white or pale yellow flowers that typically appear in clusters. The plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils near water bodies, such as rivers and ponds. Its seeds are small and contain a high amount of essential oils, contributing to its distinct aroma. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
