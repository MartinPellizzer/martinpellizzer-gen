It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its morphology makes it a hardy, adaptable shrub with ecological and historical significance."
