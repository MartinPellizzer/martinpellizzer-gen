It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by distinctive, spiny pods that contain seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it has a fibrous root system. Rhynchosia chapmanii is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in poor, dry conditions."
