    "intro": "Ranunculus atlanticus, commonly known as the Atlantic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to coastal regions of the northeastern United States and eastern Canada. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shores, where it thrives in moist, well-drained conditions. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in photosynthesis in its often-salty environment. Ranunculus atlanticus plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and provides nectar for pollinators like bees and butterflies."
