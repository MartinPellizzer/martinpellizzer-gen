    "intro": "Rhynchospora cephalotes var. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beakspur, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in the southeastern United States. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly known as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically green or reddish in color, which bloom in late summer to early fall. It is often found in association with other wetland flora, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat. Rhynchospora cephalotes var. angustifolia is adapted to saturated soils and plays a role in stabilizing wetland environments."
