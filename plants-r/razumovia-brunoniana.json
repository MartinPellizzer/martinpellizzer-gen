    "intro": "Razumovia brunoniana, commonly known as the Brunoniana razumovia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Caucasus. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and distinctive, elongated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom during the short growing season in its alpine habitat. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and requires a cool, moist environment to flourish. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Razumovia brunoniana is considered a vulnerable species, highlighting the importance of conservation efforts in its native range."
