    "intro": "Ruscus \u00d7 microglossus, commonly known as creeping spurge or evergreen spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features dense clusters of small, waxy, dark green leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and ground cover. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is often used in horticulture for its aesthetic appeal and adaptability."
