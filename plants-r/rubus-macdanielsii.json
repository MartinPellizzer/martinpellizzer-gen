    "intro": "Rubus macdanielsii, commonly known as MacDaniels' raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals and numerous stamens. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
