It typically grows to a height of 5\u201315 meters and has lanceolate, glossy dark green leaves that are usually opposite or sub-opposite. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by spherical, black berries that are an important food source for various wildlife. Its dense foliage and ability to thrive in shaded conditions make it a valuable species for reforestation and ornamental purposes."
