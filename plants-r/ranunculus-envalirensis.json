    "intro": "Ranunculus envalirensis, commonly known as the Valdese buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features a basal rosette of finely divided, palmate leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
