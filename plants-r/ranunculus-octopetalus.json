    "intro": "Ranunculus octopetalus, commonly known as the eight-petaled buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow, radially symmetrical flowers with eight petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a short, upright stem with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
