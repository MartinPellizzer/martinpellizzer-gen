    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. leptoclada, commonly known as the slender-stemmed Rosa pouzinii, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces pinnate leaves with finely serrated edges, typical of many rose species. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
