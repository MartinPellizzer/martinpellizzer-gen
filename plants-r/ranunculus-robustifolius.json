    "intro": "Ranunculus robustifolius, commonly known as the robust-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has a basal rosette of large, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor soils, allowing it to thrive in moist, woodland environments. The species is often found in meadows, stream banks, and shaded forest floors."
