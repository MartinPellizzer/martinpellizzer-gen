    "intro": "Rhizophora rheedei, commonly known as the mangrove apple or red mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to tropical regions of the Indian Ocean and western Pacific. It is characterized by its pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that extend above the water to facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. The plant thrives in saline environments and plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. The tree has a distinctive red bark and is often found in estuaries and mangrove forests."
