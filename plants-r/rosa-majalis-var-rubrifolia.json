    "intro": "Rosa majalis var. rubrifolia, commonly known as the red-leafed shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dark green, lobed leaves that turn a striking reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to white flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for garden borders and hedges. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in temperate climates."
