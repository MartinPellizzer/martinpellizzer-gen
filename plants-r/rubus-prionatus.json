It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in rocky and alpine environments. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects in degraded alpine areas."
