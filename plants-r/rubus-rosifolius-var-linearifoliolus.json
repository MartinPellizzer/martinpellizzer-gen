    "intro": "Rubus rosifolius var. linearifoliolus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense thickets. The leaves are compound, typically with 5 to 9 leaflets that are elongated and have a serrated margin. It produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by red, edible berries in the fall. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and streamside habitats."
