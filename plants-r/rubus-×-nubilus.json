It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or orange in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a climbing habit due to its prickly stems. Botanically, it is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
