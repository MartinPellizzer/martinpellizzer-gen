    "intro": "Rhinanthus borealis subsp. kyrollae, commonly known as the northern marsh yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to northern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. This subspecies typically grows in wet meadows and marshy habitats, where it forms dense stands. Its roots are hemiparasitic, meaning they partially depend on host plants for nutrients. The plant plays an important role in supporting pollinators and maintaining biodiversity in its ecosystem."
