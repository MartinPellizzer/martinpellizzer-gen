    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, pale green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by dark purple, edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its berries."
