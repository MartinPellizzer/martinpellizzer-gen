    "intro": "Robinia neomexicana, commonly known as the New Mexico honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10 to 20 inches long and composed of 15 to 30 small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring, which are followed by slender, bean-like pods. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to thrive in arid and rocky soils. The plant is also notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
