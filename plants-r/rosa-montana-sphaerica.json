    "intro": "Rosa montana sphaerica, commonly known as the spherical mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring. The plant features dark green, serrated leaves that provide a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens across temperate climates."
