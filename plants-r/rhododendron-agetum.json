    "intro": "Rhododendron agetum, commonly known as the Alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. Rhododendron agetum is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to cooler climates."
