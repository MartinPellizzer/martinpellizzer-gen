    "intro": "Rubus berthae, commonly known as the Berthae bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rosaceae. It is native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. Its fruits, known as raspberries, are edible and have a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus berthae is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
