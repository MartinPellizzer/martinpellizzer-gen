    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius var. angustifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its lanceolate, serrated leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. It produces dense clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in terminal spikes, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges. Its leaves are edible and have been used historically in salads and as a vegetable, while the plant also serves as a food source for various insects. The species is notable for its adaptability to wet environments and its role in ecological succession."
