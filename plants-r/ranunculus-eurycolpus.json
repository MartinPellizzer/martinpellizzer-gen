    "intro": "Ranunculus eurycolpus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central and South America. It features delicate, nodding yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of white or yellow sepals. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a distinctive hairy texture, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in meadows, woodlands, and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
