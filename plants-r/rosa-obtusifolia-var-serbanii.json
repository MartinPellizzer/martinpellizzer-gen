    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. serbanii, commonly known as the Serban's shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Carpathian Mountains in Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are typically borne in groups of three to five. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy ornamental plant suitable for gardens and landscapes. This variety is noted for its compact growth habit and ornamental value, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species."
