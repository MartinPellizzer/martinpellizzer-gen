It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that are often hairy on the underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple fruits that are typically clustered together, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or thickets. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
