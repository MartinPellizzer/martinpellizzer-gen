It is a low-growing perennial herb characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are opposite and have a distinctive hairy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their purported soothing properties. The species is adapted to moist, shaded environments and thrives in woodland habitats."
