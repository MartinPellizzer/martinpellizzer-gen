    "intro": "Rubus distans, commonly known as the distant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
