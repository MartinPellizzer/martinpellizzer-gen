    "intro": "Rosa banksiae f. aculeata, commonly known as the prickly banksia rose, is a botanical variant of the Banksia rose, characterized by its dense, thorny stems and foliage. It is native to the eastern regions of Australia, where it thrives in coastal and sandy soils. The plant produces showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for small gardens or as a decorative hedge. The variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, though it requires well-drained soil and full sun for optimal growth."
