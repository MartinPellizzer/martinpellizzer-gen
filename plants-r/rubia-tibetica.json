    "intro": "Rubia tibetica, commonly known as Tibetan madder, is a perennial flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species known for their medicinal and dye-producing properties. The plant is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters. Its roots and leaves have been traditionally used in herbal medicine for their purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Rubia tibetica is also valued for its ability to produce a red dye, similar to other species in the Rubia genus."
