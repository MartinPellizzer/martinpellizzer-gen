    "intro": "Rhododendron commutatum, commonly known as the Japanese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to Japan and parts of Korea. It features broad, ovate leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence on the underside. The plant produces clusters of funnel-shaped, bell-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in early spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its botanical characteristics make it well-suited for woodland gardens and as a foundation plant in landscaping."
