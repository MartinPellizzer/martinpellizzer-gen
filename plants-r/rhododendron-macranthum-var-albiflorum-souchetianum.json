    "intro": "Rhododendron macranthum var. albiflorum-souchetianum, commonly known as the Souchet's white-flowered rhododendron, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with dense, evergreen foliage that provides a lush backdrop to its blossoms. It prefers acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to thrive in cool, moist climates and its long flowering period."
