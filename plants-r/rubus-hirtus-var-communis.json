    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. communis, commonly known as the common bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small white to pinkish flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and maintaining ecological balance."
