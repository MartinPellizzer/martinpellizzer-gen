It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Rubus fusus is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows, contributing to local biodiversity."
