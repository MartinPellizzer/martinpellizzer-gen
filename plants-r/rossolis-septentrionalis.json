    "intro": "Rossolis septentrionalis, commonly known as the northern rossol, is a rare flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It belongs to the family Rosaceae and is characterized by its small, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with woody stems and hairy leaves adapted to cold, nutrient-poor soils. Its roots are fibrous and help anchor it in rocky substrates, while its leaves are arranged alternately along the stem. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rossolis septentrionalis is considered endangered and is of interest to botanists studying alpine flora."
