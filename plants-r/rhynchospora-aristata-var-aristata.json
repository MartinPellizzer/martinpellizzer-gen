    "intro": "Rhynchospora aristata var. aristata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, where it thrives in full to partial sunlight. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that bear dense clusters of small, spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often with a distinct midrib, and are arranged in a basal rosette. The flowers are small and inconspicuous, with three stamens and a single pistil, typical of the Cyperaceae family."
