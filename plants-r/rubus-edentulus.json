    "intro": "Rubus edentulus, commonly known as the sand raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the coastal regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in dunes or along shorelines. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The species is adapted to harsh coastal environments and plays a role in stabilizing dune ecosystems."
