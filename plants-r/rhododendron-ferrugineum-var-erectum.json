It features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to red in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that are arranged in whorls around the stems. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. This variety is distinguished by its upright growth habit compared to the more prostrate form of the species."
