    "intro": "Rhus trichocarpa f. viridis, commonly known as the green-leafed sumac, is a variant of the smooth sumac characterized by its distinctive green foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States, typically found in dry, rocky areas. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value. The plant is adapted to arid conditions and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
