    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens subsp. arvensis, commonly known as the field rose, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which help protect it from herbivores. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, followed by red-orange hips that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in meadows. Rosa sempervirens subsp. arvensis is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is used in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of conditions."
