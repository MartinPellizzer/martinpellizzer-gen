    "intro": "Rhododendron laticostum, commonly known as the broad-costate rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, pink to reddish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments, preferring well-drained acidic soils. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps retain moisture. Rhododendron laticostum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
