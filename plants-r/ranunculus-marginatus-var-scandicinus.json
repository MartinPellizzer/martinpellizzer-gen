    "intro": "Ranunculus marginatus var. scandicinus, commonly known as the Scandinavian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to northern Europe. It features delicate, yellow flowers with a distinctive greenish margin, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and woodland edges, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
