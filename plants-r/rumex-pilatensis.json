    "intro": "Rumex pilatensis, commonly known as the Pilat sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes plants known for their distinctive leaf shapes and often edible leaves. The plant features alternate, lanceolate leaves that are often reddish or purple-tinged, especially along the veins. It produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Rumex pilatensis is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky slopes."
