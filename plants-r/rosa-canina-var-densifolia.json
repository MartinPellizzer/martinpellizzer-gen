    "intro": "Rosa canina var. densifolia, commonly known as the densefoliate dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a slightly serrated edge. This variety produces red-orange hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional herbal remedies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges."
