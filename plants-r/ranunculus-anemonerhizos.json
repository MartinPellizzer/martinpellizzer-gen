    "intro": "Ranunculus anemonerhizos, commonly known as the European buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or white flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201360 cm, with palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread vegetatively and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Ranunculus anemonerhizos is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
