    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria var. divergens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats that can dominate certain habitats."
