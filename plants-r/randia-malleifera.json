It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with hairy stems and palmate leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers that give way to orange, star-shaped fruits. The fruits are edible when ripe, though they are typically consumed in their immature, green stage."
