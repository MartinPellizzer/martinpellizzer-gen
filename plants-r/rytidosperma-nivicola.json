    "intro": "Rytidosperma nivicola, commonly known as the snow grass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its low-growing, tufted habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in alpine or arctic environments. Due to its resilience to harsh conditions, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small organisms."
