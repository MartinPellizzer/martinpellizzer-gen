    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. pervirens, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its evergreen foliage, which remains green throughout the year, and its clusters of fragrant, pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has a compact, rounded growth habit with thorny stems and glossy, dark green leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its hardiness and ability to withstand coastal conditions also make it suitable for seaside landscapes."
