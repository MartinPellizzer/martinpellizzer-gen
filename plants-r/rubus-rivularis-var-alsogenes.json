    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. alsogenes, commonly known as the waterberry or swamp blackberry, is a shrub-like species native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit, with hairy stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible, dark red to black berries. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found along streambanks and in swampy areas. Due to its adaptability, it plays an important role in stabilizing soil and providing food for wildlife."
