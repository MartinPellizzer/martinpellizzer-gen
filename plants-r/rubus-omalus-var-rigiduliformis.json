    "intro": "Rubus omalus var. rigiduliformis, commonly known as the rigid-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically firm and less juicy compared to other blackberry varieties. Its flowers are white and clustered in the axils of the leaves, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. This variety is valued for its hardiness and potential use in both ornamental and edible horticulture."
