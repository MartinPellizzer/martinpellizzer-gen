    "intro": "Ruellia aruensis, commonly known as the Hawaiian ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Hawaiian Islands. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of tubular flowers. The plant typically produces blue or violet flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Ruellia aruensis is often found in moist, shaded areas of forests and is adapted to the tropical climate of Hawaii. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, although it can become invasive in certain environments."
