    "intro": "Rosa deminuescens, commonly known as the declining rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, with pink to red petals that attract pollinators. Native to certain regions of South America, it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
