    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. calcicola, commonly known as the calcicola rose, is a shrub-like plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to harsh, dry environments and thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
