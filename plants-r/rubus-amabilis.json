    "intro": "Rubus amabilis, commonly known as the sweet cherry or the red raspberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red when mature, though some varieties may have a yellow or orange hue. These berries are rich in antioxidants and are often used in culinary applications. Rubus amabilis thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
