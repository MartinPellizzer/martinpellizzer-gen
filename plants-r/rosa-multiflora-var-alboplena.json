    "intro": "Rosa multiflora var. alboplena, commonly known as the White Multiflora Rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless growth habit and clusters of fragrant, white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are often covered in a soft, grayish bloom. It is highly valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thick, impenetrable hedges. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread rapidly."
