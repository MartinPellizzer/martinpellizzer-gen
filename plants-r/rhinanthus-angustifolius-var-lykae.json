    "intro": "Rhinanthus angustifolius var. lykae, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow rocket, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Scrophulariaceae. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinct appearance. This variety is typically found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and waste areas. It plays a role in supporting pollinators and is of interest in ecological studies due to its specific habitat preferences."
