    "intro": "Richardella chocoensis, commonly known as the Chocoan Richardella, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly in Ecuador and Colombia. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its woody stems, heart-shaped leaves, and showy, pentagonal flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
