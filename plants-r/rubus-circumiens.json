    "intro": "Rubus circumiens, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, wooded areas. The botanical features of Rubus circumiens make it an important component of its native ecosystem."
