    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. pseudojordanii, commonly known as the Jordanian rose, is a shrub-like species native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It features thorny stems and produces small, pale pink to white flowers with a faint fragrance. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers typically bloom in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often found in desert or semi-desert habitats. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in xeriscaped gardens."
