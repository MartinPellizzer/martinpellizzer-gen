    "intro": "Rosa arizonica, commonly known as the Arizona rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky or sandy soils, often in arid or semi-arid environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and its stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Rosa arizonica is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens despite its preference for specific ecological conditions."
