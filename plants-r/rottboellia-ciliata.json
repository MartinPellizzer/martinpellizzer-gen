    "intro": "Rottboellia ciliata, commonly known as the African grass or false rice, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is a perennial grass that typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in agricultural fields. The plant has slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, inconspicuous flowers are arranged in spikelets, and it produces small, three-angled seeds that are dispersed by wind. Rottboellia ciliata is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions, making it a common weed in many parts of the world."
