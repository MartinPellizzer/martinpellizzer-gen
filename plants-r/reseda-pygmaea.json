It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, branching stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. Reseda pygmaea is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in dye production."
