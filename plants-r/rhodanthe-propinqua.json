    "intro": "Rhodanthe propinqua, commonly known as the slender everlasting or narrow-leaved everlasting, is a flowering plant native to Western Australia. It is a member of the daisy family, Asteraceae, and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that are clustered in dense, spherical heads, which bloom throughout the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. Rhodanthe propinqua is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
