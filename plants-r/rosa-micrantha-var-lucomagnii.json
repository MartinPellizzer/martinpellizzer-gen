    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. lucomagnii, commonly known as the Lucca rose, is a rare and distinctive variant of the Rosa micrantha species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, producing delicate, semi-double petals. It is native to specific regions in Europe, particularly in the mountainous areas of Italy and Austria. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
