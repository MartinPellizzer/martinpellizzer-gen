    "intro": "Rhinocerotidium rhinoceros, commonly known as the horned orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fleshy leaves and striking, showy flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is known for its unique rhizomatous growth habit. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained, nutrient-rich soil. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its natural range."
