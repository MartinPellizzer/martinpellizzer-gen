    "intro": "Ranunculus bulbosus var. brachiatus, commonly known as the branched buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a short, rhizomatous root system and produces basal leaves that are deeply lobed and often covered in fine hairs. The plant is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with numerous petal-like sepals, which bloom in early spring. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
