    "intro": "Rottboellia selloana, commonly known as the African grass or red grass, is a perennial grass species native to Africa, Asia, and Australia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, reddish-brown inflorescences that appear at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers, which are typically green or purple in color. Rottboellia selloana thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in open grasslands, along roadsides, and in agricultural fields. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been introduced to various regions for erosion control and as a landscape plant."
