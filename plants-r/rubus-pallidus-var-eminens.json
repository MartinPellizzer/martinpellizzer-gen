    "intro": "Rubus pallidus var. eminens, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically eaten by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
