    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius var. geniculatus, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorned stems, which help it climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a tart flavor. Its leaves are rhomboid in shape, with serrated edges, and are often covered in fine hairs. This variety is notable for its adaptability to a range of soil types and its role in local ecosystems as both a food source and a habitat for various wildlife."
