    "intro": "Rhus microphylla var. vestita, commonly known as the silverleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, silver-white undersides on its pinnate leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to arid environments. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its autumn foliage, which turns reddish-brown."
