    "intro": "Rosa trifoliata, commonly known as the three-leaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to East Asia. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which consist of three leaflets, and its fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits called rosehips, which are rich in vitamin C. Rosa trifoliata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has historical uses in traditional medicine. It is also valued in horticulture for its adaptability to various soil types and climates."
