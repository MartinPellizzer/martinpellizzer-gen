    "intro": "Rhipidocladum zoqueorum, commonly known as the Zoquean spurge, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula in Mexico. It is a succulent shrub characterized by its fleshy, dark green leaves and yellow-orange flowers that bloom in spring. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. It has a compact growth habit and is often found in limestone areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
