    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. mendax, commonly known as the western yellow crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial native to western North America. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a hairy center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
