It features a basal rosette of shiny, waxy leaves that are typically lobed or divided. The plant produces showy, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is sensitive to heat and drought."
