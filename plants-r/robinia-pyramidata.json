    "intro": "Robinia pyramidata, commonly known as the sourwood tree, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright, pyramidal shape and compound leaves that are gray-green in color. The tree produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive yellow, lemon-scented fruits. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in moist, well-drained soils. The plant has historical uses in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
