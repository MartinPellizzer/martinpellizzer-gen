    "intro": "Rhododendron germanicum var. hirsutum, commonly known as the hairy rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features dark green, leathery leaves that are densely covered with short, stiff hairs, giving it a distinctive textured appearance. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in early to mid-spring, which are typically borne on long, pendulous inflorescences. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for gardeners in temperate climates."
