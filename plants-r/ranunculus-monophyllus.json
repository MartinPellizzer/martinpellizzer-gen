    "intro": "Ranunculus monophyllus, commonly known as the single-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers with prominent black spots. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ranunculus monophyllus is often found in calcareous soils and is an important species in ecological studies due to its specific habitat requirements."
