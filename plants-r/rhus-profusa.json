    "intro": "Rhus profusa, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that persist into winter. Its bark is thick and rugged, often appearing scaly or furrowed, and it is adapted to a variety of soil types. Rhus profusa is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade to full sun."
