    "intro": "Ranunculus tusbyensis, commonly known as Tusby's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. It has palmately divided leaves and produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
