    "intro": "Rubus foliosus microgene litigiosus, commonly known as the fiery leaf bramble, is a shrub characterized by its serrated, dark green leaves with a distinctive reddish underside. It produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, which are edible but have a tart flavor. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its stems are thorny, providing a natural defense against herbivores. The botanical name reflects its leaf structure (\"foliosus\"), small gene pool (\"microgene\"), and its tendency to grow in litigious or contested areas (\"litigiosus\")."
