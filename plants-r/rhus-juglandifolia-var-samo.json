It features compound leaves with three to five pairs of elliptic, leathery leaflets, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by woody, winged fruits that disperse its seeds by wind. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal or lowland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens."
