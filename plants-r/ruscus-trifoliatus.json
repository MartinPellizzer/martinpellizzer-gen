    "intro": "Ruscus trifoliatus, commonly known as common spurge or evergreen spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features distinctive leaves that are trifoliate, meaning they are divided into three narrow, pointed lobes. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. These flowers are followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. Ruscus trifoliatus is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
