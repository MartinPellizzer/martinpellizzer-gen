It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink in color. Its leaves are opposite and ovate, often with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Rostellularia palustris plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing habitat and nectar for various pollinators."
