It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant features compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. The flowers are white or pale pink, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its edible fruits."
