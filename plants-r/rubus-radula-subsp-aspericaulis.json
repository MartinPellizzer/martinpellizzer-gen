    "intro": "Rubus radula subsp. aspericaulis, commonly known as the roughleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to western North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The subspecies is distinguished by its rough, hairy leaves and often grows in moist, woodland habitats. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits. However, it can be invasive in some regions due to its vigorous growth and ability to spread through runners."
