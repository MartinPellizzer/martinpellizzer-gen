    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia, commonly known as Indian madder, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and heart-shaped leaves, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces small, pale purple flowers that bloom in summer, and its roots are the primary source of a red dye used historically in textiles and medicine. Rubia cordifolia is also valued for its medicinal properties, with traditional uses including treating skin conditions and digestive issues. Its cultivation is often associated with its ornamental value and sustainable dye production."
