    "intro": "Rubus leviculus, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of brambles native to North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant produces small, edible berries that are usually black when ripe, though they are less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. Its stems are covered in fine, hooked prickles, and its leaves are trifoliate with serrated edges. Rubus leviculus plays an important role in supporting local wildlife, including birds and insects."
