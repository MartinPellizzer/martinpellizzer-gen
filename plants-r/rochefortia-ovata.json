    "intro": "Rochefortia ovata, commonly known as the desert globemallow, is a perennial shrub native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compact, globular shape and silver-gray foliage, which helps it conserve water in harsh environments. The plant produces showy, yellow-orange flowers with a distinctive hooded structure, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are thick and leathery, adapted to reduce water loss, while its roots are deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater. Rochefortia ovata is well-suited for xeriscaping and is a valuable plant for stabilizing sandy soils in desert landscapes."
