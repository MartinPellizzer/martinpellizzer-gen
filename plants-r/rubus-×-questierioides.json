It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus glaucus (evergreen blackberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically has thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are larger and more tart than those of its parent species. This hybrid is valued for its fruit quality and is commonly cultivated for both commercial and home gardening purposes."
