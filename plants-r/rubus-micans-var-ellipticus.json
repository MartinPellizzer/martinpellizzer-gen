    "intro": "Rubus micans var. ellipticus, commonly known as the elliptic bramble, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia, particularly China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its elliptical leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, usually white or pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
