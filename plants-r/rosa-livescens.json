    "intro": "Rosa livescens, commonly known as the evergreen rose, is a species native to southern Africa. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring dense, thorny stems and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the year. Its evergreen nature allows it to maintain foliage year-round, making it a popular ornamental plant. Rosa livescens thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal water once established."
