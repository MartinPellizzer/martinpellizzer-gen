    "intro": "Rosa floccida var. castriferrei, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a rare and distinctive species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and flowers that range from white to pale pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of white hairs, which help to insulate the plant and reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
