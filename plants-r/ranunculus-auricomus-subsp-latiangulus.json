    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. latiangulus, commonly known as the Chinese buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to eastern Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with 5-10 petals that are often reflexed, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in a waxy cuticle, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. The subspecies is notable for its ornamental value and is cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, buttercup-like blooms."
