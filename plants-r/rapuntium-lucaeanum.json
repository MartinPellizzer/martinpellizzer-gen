    "intro": "Rapuntium lucaeanum, commonly known as the Lucaean cress, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other well-known plants like mustard and cabbage. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by seed pods that split open to disperse its seeds. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery flavor, similar to watercress. Rapuntium lucaeanum is often found in moist, calcareous soils near streams and wetlands."
