    "intro": "Rhamnus meyeri, commonly known as Meyer's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds and mammals. Its bark is smooth and reddish-brown, becoming fissured with age, and it is often found in rocky or forested habitats. Rhamnus meyeri is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
