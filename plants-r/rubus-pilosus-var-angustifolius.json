    "intro": "Rubus pilosus var. angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny, dark red to black drupes that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
