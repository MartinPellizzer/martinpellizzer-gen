    "intro": "Restio distachyos, commonly known as the narrow-leaved restio, is a member of the Restionaceae family, native to southern Africa. It is a perennial herb with grass-like foliage, characterized by its slender, wiry stems and narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences, typically in late summer to early autumn. It thrives in coastal and sandy environments, often growing in open, well-drained areas. Due to its hardy nature and ornamental appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in natural habitats."
