    "intro": "Rubus serpens proles brevistamineus, commonly known as the short-stamineous blackberry shrub, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit, with small, dark green leaves and white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along forest edges. Due to its unique staminal structure, it is of interest to botanists studying plant morphology and evolution."
