    "intro": "Rhodospatha popayanensis, commonly known as the Popay\u00e1n orchid, is a rare and endemic species native to Colombia. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically display a mix of red, pink, and white hues. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests at high elevations. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in a basal rosette. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhodospatha popayanensis is considered a conservation concern."
