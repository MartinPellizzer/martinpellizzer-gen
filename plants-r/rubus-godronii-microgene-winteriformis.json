    "intro": "Rubus godronii microgene winteriformis, commonly known as the Godron's blackberry, is a rare and highly specialized shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant exhibits a unique growth form, with winteriformis referring to its ability to survive harsh winter conditions through a specialized dormant state. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small white flowers in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered an endangered species and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
