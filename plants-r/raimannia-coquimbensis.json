    "intro": "Raimannia coquimbensis, commonly known as the Coquimbo thistle, is a flowering plant native to Chile. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant is typically found in arid and semi-arid regions, thriving in sandy or rocky soils. It produces yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by spiny, bract-like structures. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
