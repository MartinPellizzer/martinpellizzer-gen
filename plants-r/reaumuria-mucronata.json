    "intro": "Reaumuria mucronata, commonly known as the sharp-tipped saxifrage, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its succulent, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with deep root systems that help it survive in dry conditions. Its leaves are typically fleshy and have a sharp tip, which is reflected in its scientific name. Reaumuria mucronata is often found in rocky soils and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
