    "intro": "Rottboellia loricata subsp. glaberrima, commonly known as the glabrous loricata grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its erect, cylindrical stems and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically glabrous, meaning they lack hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or open habitats. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and use in landscaping due to its hardiness and adaptability."
