    "intro": "Ranunculus cornutus var. leiocarpus, commonly known as the smoothpod buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to North America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmately lobed leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks. Its unique feature is the smooth, hairless fruit capsule, which distinguishes it from other varieties of ranunculus. It plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is often found in wetland habitats."
