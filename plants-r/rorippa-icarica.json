    "intro": "Rorippa icarica, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It typically grows in shallow water, such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows, and has finely divided, feathery leaves that float on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which are often surrounded by a cluster of bracts. Rorippa icarica is characterized by its ability to spread through rhizomes, forming dense mats that can stabilize sediments. It is a cosmopolitan species, found in temperate regions around the world."
