    "intro": "Rupicapnos sarcocapnoides, commonly known as the silverleaf snowbell, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of white, waxy hairs, giving it a silvery appearance. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, which bloom in the spring. Its growth habit is upright and compact, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Rupicapnos sarcocapnoides is drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, preferring full sun to partial shade."
