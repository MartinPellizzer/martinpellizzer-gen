    "intro": "Rhododendron gregarium, commonly known as the clustered rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Rhododendron gregarium is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to form thickets in natural landscapes."
