    "intro": "Rubus longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that have serrated edges. Rubus longipes is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade."
