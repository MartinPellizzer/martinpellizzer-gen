    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. saelanii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be somewhat challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
