This plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its botanical features include a rhizomatous root system and spike-like inflorescences. The saxicola sedge is adapted to wetland environments and plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
