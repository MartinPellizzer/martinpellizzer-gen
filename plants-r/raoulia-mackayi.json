    "intro": "Raoulia mackayi, commonly known as the Mackay's raoulia, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of New Zealand. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and purple. The plant has a low-growing habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Raoulia mackayi thrives in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it forms dense clusters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
