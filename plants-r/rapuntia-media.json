    "intro": "Rapuntia media, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height, adorned with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with prominent white petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are thick and tuberous, which store nutrients and allow the plant to survive harsh winter conditions. Rapuntia media is known for its edible tubers, which have a slightly bitter taste and are used in various traditional cuisines."
