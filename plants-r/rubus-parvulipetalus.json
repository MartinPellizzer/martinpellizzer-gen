    "intro": "Rubus parvulipetalus, commonly known as the small-petaled blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southern United States. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black fruits that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry species. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are usually white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for use in jams and preserves."
