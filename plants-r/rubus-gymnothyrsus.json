    "intro": "Rubus gymnothyrsus, commonly known as the naked-thorn blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and thickets, preferring partial shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated and have a glossy appearance. The fruit is edible, though often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor."
