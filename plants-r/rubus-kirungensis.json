    "intro": "Rubus kirungensis, commonly known as the Kirungensis blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the highlands of East Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
