    "intro": "Rhynchosia ixodes, commonly known as the tickseed or tickseed beggar-ticks, is a flowering plant in the Fabaceae family. It is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and small, clustered flowers. The plant produces distinctive, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a legume pod that splits open to release seeds, which are often dispersed by wind. Rhynchosia ixodes is adapted to grow in a variety of soils but prefers well-drained, sunny environments."
