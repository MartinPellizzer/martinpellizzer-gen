    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene hylonomus, commonly known as the Hylonomus bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to anchor itself to surfaces. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in moist, shaded environments. The species is notable for its adaptability and role in supporting local wildlife."
