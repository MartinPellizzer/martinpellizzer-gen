It features a basal rosette of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale yellow flowers during the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Raddia sympodica thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight, making it a hardy addition to arid gardens."
