    "intro": "Rubus extensus, commonly known as the broadleaf raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and large, compound leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces showy white or pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red or yellow berries in the summer. Its fruit is edible but often has a tart flavor, making it a popular choice for jams and preserves. Rubus extensus thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
