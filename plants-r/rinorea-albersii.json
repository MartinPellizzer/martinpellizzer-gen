    "intro": "Rinorea albersii, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Albers' rinorea, is a tropical shrub native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often velvety to the touch. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Rinorea albersii is typically found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for ecological and horticultural study."
