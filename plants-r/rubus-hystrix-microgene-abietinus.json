    "intro": "Rubus hystrix microgene abietinus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are often covered in dense, glandular hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
