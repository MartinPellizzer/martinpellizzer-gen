    "intro": "Rapistrella, commonly known as the \"false nightshade,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the nightshade family, Solanaceae. It consists of several species, most of which are shrubs or small trees native to tropical and subtropical regions. The plants typically have alternate, simple, and often hairy leaves, and their flowers are usually showy with five petals. The fruits are berries that can be toxic, containing alkaloids similar to those found in other members of the Solanaceae family. Rapistrella species are often grown as ornamentals due to their attractive foliage and flowers."
