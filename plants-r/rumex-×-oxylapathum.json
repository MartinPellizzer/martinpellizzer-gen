    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 oxylapathum, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broad-leaved sorrel). It is characterized by its distinctive broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish at the base. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in clusters, typically in the spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
