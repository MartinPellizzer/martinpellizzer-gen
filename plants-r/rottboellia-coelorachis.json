    "intro": "Rottboellia coelorachis, commonly known as the false rice or velvet grass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit, with dense, fibrous roots and narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in wetland environments and is often found in marshes, riverbanks, and other moist soils. Due to its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural areas."
