    "intro": "Rhododendron kiyosumense subsp. mayebarae, commonly known as the Mayebarae rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to Japan. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, preferring acidic soil conditions. Its floral structure includes five to seven petals, often with a distinctive pinkish or reddish hue. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
