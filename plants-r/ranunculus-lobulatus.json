    "intro": "Ranunculus lobulatus, commonly known as the fringed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in woodland or grassland habitats. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often reddish in color. Ranunculus lobulatus is often found in shaded areas and is known for its early spring bloom."
