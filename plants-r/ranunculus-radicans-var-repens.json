    "intro": "Ranunculus radicans var. repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across moist soils in wetlands, marshes, and stream banks. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and often have a distinctive waxy coating. It is considered an invasive species in many areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
