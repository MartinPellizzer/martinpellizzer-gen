    "intro": "Rosa gymnocarpa subsp. gymnocarpa, commonly known as the naked-seed rose, is a species native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its simple, often thornless stems and alternate, pinnately compound leaves. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five to seven petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruit is a woody, ellipsoid achene, which is notably lacking in the typical fuzzy pappus found in many other roses. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
