    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 horridiramus, commonly known as the brambleberry hybrid, is a complex hybrid species within the Rubus genus, which includes raspberries and blackberries. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to its parent species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its genetic variability, it is challenging to classify and cultivate consistently."
