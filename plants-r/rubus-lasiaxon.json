    "intro": "Rubus lasiaxon, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of flowering plants in the rose family. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple or black when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
