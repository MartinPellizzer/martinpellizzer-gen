    "intro": "Rumex scutatus var. maculatus, commonly known as the spotted sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, often marked with dark spots or streaks. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
