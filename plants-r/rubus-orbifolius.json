    "intro": "Rubus orbifolius, commonly known as the round-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically oval or round in shape, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus orbifolius is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it can spread through its extensive root system."
