It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, powdery coating. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its roots are fibrous and can be used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
