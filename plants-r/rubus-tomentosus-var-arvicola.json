    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus var. arvicola, commonly known as the alpine bramble, is a shrub native to alpine and subalpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and hairy, dark green leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, juicy berries that are edible. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Due to its hardiness, it is often found in mountainous areas where other plants struggle to grow."
