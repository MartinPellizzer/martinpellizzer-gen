It is characterized by its small, pale pink flowers and thorny stems, typical of many Rosa species. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Its historical significance is noted in botanical studies due to its unique genetic makeup and limited distribution. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this endangered variety from habitat loss and climate change."
