    "intro": "Ruyschia pavonii, commonly known as the golden saxifrage, is a low-growing, mat-forming perennial plant native to South Africa. It features small, bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, adding a striking visual contrast to its silver-gray foliage. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and full sun to partial shade, making it well-suited for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in a fine layer of silky hairs, which help reduce water loss. Ruyschia pavonii is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in Mediterranean climates."
