    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum f. rubescens, commonly known as the red-leafed swamp azalea, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features dense, leathery foliage that turns a striking reddish-purple in the fall, adding visual interest to the landscape. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in late spring, which are typically borne on short, upright pedicels. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and partial to full shade, making it well-suited for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its unique leaf coloration and reliable blooming habit."
