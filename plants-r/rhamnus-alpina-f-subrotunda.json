    "intro": "Rhamnus alpina f. subrotunda, commonly known as the alpine buckthorn, is a shrub native to high-altitude regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often slightly rounded at the ends, giving it the subspecies name *subrotunda*. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and mountainous areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and is a common species in subalpine ecosystems."
