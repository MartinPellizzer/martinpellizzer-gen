    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius var. megastachys, commonly known as the large-stamen raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing a basal rosette of leaves and the second year producing the flowering and fruiting stems. The leaves are typically oval to rhomboid in shape, with serrated margins, and are covered in fine, white pubescence. The flowers are usually pink to reddish, and the fruits are aggregate berries that develop from the flowering stems. This plant is often found in open woods, thickets, and along roadsides, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
