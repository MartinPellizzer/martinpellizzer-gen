    "intro": "Rubus latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its large, serrated leaves and produces clusters of small, dark red berries. The plant is a deciduous shrub that thrives in temperate climates and can often be found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink and appear in the spring. The berries are edible but can be quite tart, making them suitable for jams and pies."
