    "intro": "Rhamnus cathartica var. davurica, commonly known as the Russian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn reddish in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant contains anthraquinone compounds, which have been used historically for their laxative properties."
