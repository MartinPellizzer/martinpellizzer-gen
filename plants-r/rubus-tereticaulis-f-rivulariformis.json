    "intro": "Rubus tereticaulis f. rivulariformis, commonly known as the slender blackberry fern, is a rare and distinctive plant species belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, clustered leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces tiny, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to blackberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found along stream banks and in rocky crevices. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
