    "intro": "Rogeria petrophila, commonly known as the rock lily, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its striking violet to purple flowers and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, arid environments. It produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, Rogeria petrophila is considered a rare and endangered species."
