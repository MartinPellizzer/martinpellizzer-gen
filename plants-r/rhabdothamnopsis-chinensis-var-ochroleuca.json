    "intro": "Rhabdothamnopsis chinensis var. ochroleuca, commonly known as the yellow-leaved spurge, is a flowering plant native to China. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive yellowish-green leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests or mountainous regions. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are clustered in cyathia, typical of the spurge family. The leaves are often covered in a fine layer of white wax, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat."
