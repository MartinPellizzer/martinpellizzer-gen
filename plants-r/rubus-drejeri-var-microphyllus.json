    "intro": "Rubus drejeri var. microphyllus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern China. It is characterized by its small, dark red to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with a hairy texture and produces erect, thorny stems that can grow up to 1.5 meters in height. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
