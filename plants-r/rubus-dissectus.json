    "intro": "Rubus dissectus, commonly known as the dissected blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, pinnately arranged leaves that give it a delicate, fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
