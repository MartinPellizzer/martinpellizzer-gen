    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. hispidella, commonly known as the hispid rose, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features upright, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in summer, which are typically borne in clusters. Its hirsute (hairy) appearance is a distinguishing characteristic, giving it the \"hispid\" suffix in its name. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardiness in mild climates."
