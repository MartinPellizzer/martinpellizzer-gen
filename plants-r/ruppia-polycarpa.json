    "intro": "Ruppia polycarpa, commonly known as the sea onion, is a marine flowering plant that thrives in brackish and saltwater environments. It is characterized by its submerged, strap-shaped leaves and small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant is typically found in coastal areas, such as estuaries and tidal flats, where it plays a vital role in stabilizing sediment. Its seeds are dispersed by water, allowing it to colonize new areas along shorelines. Ruppia polycarpa is an important species for aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
