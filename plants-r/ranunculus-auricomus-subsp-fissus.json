    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. fissus, commonly known as the fissured buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and wet meadows. Its flowers are often visited by bees and other pollinators, contributing to its ecological importance. The subspecies is distinguished by its deeply lobed leaves and the presence of a distinctive fissure in the leaf base."
