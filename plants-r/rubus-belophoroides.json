    "intro": "Rubus belophoroides, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark purple berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white to pinkish flowers in the spring. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
