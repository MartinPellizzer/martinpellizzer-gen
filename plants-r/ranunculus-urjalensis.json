    "intro": "Ranunculus urjalensis, commonly known as the Mongolian buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained soils and cool climates. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it produces a capsule fruit containing multiple seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
