    "intro": "Rubus aenigmaticus, commonly known as the enigmatic raspberry, is a shrub native to the temperate regions of the Pacific Northwest. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with flowering occurring on the previous year's stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and understudied species within the Rubus genus."
