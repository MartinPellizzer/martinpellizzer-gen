    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. pauperata, commonly known as the poorflower rose, is a rare and delicate variation of the blue rose. It is characterized by its pale blue to white petals and reduced floral display, giving it a more subdued appearance compared to typical roses. This form is typically found in alpine or rocky habitats, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its botanical features include narrow, glandular leaves and a compact growth habit. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is often considered a botanical curiosity."
