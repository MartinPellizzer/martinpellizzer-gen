It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to temperate regions of the Americas. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. Its leaves are covered in fine, glandular hairs that give them a distinctive, shiny appearance. This species is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade and well-drained conditions."
