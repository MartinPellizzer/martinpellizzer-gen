    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. elegans, commonly known as the silky rose or woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to parts of Asia, including China and Japan. It is characterized by its soft, grayish-white fuzzy foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to pale red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and has thorny stems, typical of many rose species. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is well-suited to temperate climates."
