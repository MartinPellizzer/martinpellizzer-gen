The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland areas. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the fruit is a small, dark berry. This form is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties but is valued for its unique floral and fruit characteristics."
