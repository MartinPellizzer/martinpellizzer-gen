    "intro": "Ruizia ferruginea subsp. borbonica, commonly known as the Bourbon ruizia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean, particularly Cuba and the Greater Antilles. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and limestone-rich soils. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant."
