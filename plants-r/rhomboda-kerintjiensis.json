    "intro": "Rhomboda kerintjiensis, commonly known as the Kerintji sandalwood, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, dark-colored heartwood, which is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant typically grows as a small to medium-sized tree, reaching heights of up to 15 meters. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy surface and a distinctive rhomboidal shape. Due to overharvesting and habitat loss, conservation efforts are critical to its survival."
