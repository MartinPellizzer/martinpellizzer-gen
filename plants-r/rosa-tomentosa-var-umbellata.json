    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. umbellata, commonly known as the woolly rose or the silver-haired rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-white pubescence that covers the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, which are typically borne on long, slender peduncles. Its leaves are trifoliate, with each leaflet being ovate and covered in fine hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique texture and floral display."
