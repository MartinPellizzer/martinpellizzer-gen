    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophytus f. gunae, commonly known as the Gunae ranunculus, is a botanical variant of the alpine buttercup. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. This plant thrives in high-altitude environments, often found in rocky or alpine meadows. Its leaves are trifoliate, with lobed margins, and it produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by the wind. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to cold and harsh mountainous conditions."
