    "intro": "Rosa arvensis f. atrata, commonly known as the black rose, is a variant of the field rose that exhibits distinctive dark pigmentation. This form is characterized by its deep purple to almost black flowers, which contrast sharply with its green foliage. The plant is a perennial shrub that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features include thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and fragrant flowers that bloom in summer. The dark coloration of its petals is due to high concentrations of anthocyanins, giving it a unique ornamental appeal."
