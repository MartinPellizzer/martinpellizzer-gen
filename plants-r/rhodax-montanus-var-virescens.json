    "intro": "Rhodax montanus var. virescens, commonly known as the green-leaved mountain rhodax, is a perennial shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It features lance-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green, often with a waxy surface that aids in water retention. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of white to pale pink during the spring and early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its unique foliage and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in specialized gardens."
