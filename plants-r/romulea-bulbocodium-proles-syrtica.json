    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium proles syrtica, commonly known as the Syrtic sand-rose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulbous structure that allows it to survive in harsh, dry environments. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred shape, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, adapted to minimize water loss. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
