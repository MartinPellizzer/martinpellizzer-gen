    "intro": "Ribes triste var. repens, commonly known as creeping goberry, is a low-growing shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by edible, bright red berries. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a slightly serrated margin. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
