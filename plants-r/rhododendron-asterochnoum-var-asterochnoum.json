    "intro": "Rhododendron asterochnoum var. asterochnoum, commonly known as the star-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southeastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with elliptical leaves that are often covered in a distinctive star-shaped pattern of raised glands. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for shaded garden landscapes. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
