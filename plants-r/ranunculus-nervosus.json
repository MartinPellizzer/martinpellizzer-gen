    "intro": "Ranunculus nervosus, commonly known as the veined buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive veined pattern. The plant typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its diverse and often ornamental species. The seeds are dispersed by wind, and the plant can spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some areas."
