    "intro": "Rosa stylosa var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular-stemmed shrub rose, is a species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems covered in glandular dots, which give it its botanical name. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in spring, which are typically followed by oval, red-orange hips. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are often hairy underneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
