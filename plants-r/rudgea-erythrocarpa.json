    "intro": "Rudgea erythrocarpa, commonly known as the red-fruited rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, clustered white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red, fleshy berries that are visually striking. Its leaves are typically elliptical, glossy, and arranged oppositely along the stems. While not widely cultivated, it is valued in horticulture for its ornamental berries and unique appearance."
