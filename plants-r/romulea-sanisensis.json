    "intro": "Romulea sanisensis, commonly known as the Sanisensian bulbous orchid, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking, spurred flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant produces a bulbous stem and has narrow, grass-like leaves that help it survive in arid conditions. It flowers during the summer months and is often found in rocky outcrops and sandy soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Romulea sanisensis is considered a vulnerable species."
