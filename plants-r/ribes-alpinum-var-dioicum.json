    "intro": "Ribes alpinum var. dioicum, commonly known as the alpine gooseberry, is a dioecious species native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with slender stems and alternate, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are either male or female on separate plants, a feature typical of dioecious species. Its fruits are red, fleshy berries that mature in late summer and are often used in traditional herbal remedies. This plant thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes."
