    "intro": "Rhododendron leptosanthum, commonly known as the slender-scented rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to purple in color. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers cool, moist environments. Its leaves are elongated and leathery, providing a dense canopy that supports various forms of understory vegetation. Rhododendron leptosanthum is often found in forested areas at high elevations, where it plays a significant role in local ecosystems."
