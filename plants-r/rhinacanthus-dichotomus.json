    "intro": "Rhinacanthus dichotomus, commonly known as the split-leaf or double-leaf balsam, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive bipinnate leaves that split into two equal parts, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, often clustered in terminal panicles. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardeners, though it is relatively rare in cultivation. The species is also valued for its medicinal properties in traditional medicine."
