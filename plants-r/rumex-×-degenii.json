    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 degenii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leaved sorrel). The plant typically has broad, arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple underside, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The plant is edible, though its leaves contain oxalic acid and should be consumed in moderation."
