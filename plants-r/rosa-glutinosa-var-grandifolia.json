    "intro": "Rosa glutinosa var. grandifolia, commonly known as the sticky rose or sticky wild rose, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by red, hairy fruits called hips. It thrives in moist, woodland environments and is often found in partial shade. The sticky resin on its stems and leaves gives it its common name and makes it distinctive in the genus Rosa."
