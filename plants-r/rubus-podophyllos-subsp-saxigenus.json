    "intro": "Rubus podophyllos subsp. saxigenus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and prickly stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, which are an important food source for various wildlife species. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is well adapted to cold climates and can tolerate harsh environmental conditions."
