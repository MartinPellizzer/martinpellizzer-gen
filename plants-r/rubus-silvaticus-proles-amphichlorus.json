    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus proles amphichlorus, commonly known as the double-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its unique floral structure. This plant belongs to the Rosaceae family and is known for its bi-colored flowers, which typically display both white and pink hues. The inflorescence consists of two distinct flower clusters, one white and one pink, giving it its distinctive appearance. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with moist, well-drained soil. The fruit, while similar to regular blackberries, is smaller and has a more delicate flavor."
