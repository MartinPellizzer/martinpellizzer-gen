    "intro": "Rumex umbellatus, commonly known as the clustered sorrel, is a herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its upright, branched stems and alternate leaves that are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple underside. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in umbel-like clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are edible and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex umbellatus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
