    "intro": "Ranunculus acris subsp. hultenii, commonly known as the Hult\u00e9n's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. The plant features basal leaves that are palmately divided, with a hairy surface, and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are usually borne on tall, slender stems and bloom in early spring. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and geographic distribution compared to the typical form of Ranunculus acris."
