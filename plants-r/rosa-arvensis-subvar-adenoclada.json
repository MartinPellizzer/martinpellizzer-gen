It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems that exude a sticky substance when broken. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This subspecies is often found in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and woodland edges."
