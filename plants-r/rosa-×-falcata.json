    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 falcata, commonly known as the evergreen roses, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage that remains evergreen throughout the year, providing year-round visual interest. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers in a range of colors, including pink, red, and white. It is typically shrub-like in form, with thorny stems and a compact growth habit. Rosa \u00d7 falcata is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils."
