It is characterized by its dark purple to black fruits, which are typically larger and more robust than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers and has thorny stems typical of the Rosa genus. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets. This variety is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates."
