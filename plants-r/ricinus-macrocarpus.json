    "intro": "Ricinus macrocarpus, commonly known as the large-seeded castor plant, is a species native to tropical regions of Africa. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiny seed capsules. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, making it both dangerous and valuable in certain medicinal applications. Its growth habit includes a tall, upright stem with hairy foliage, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Due to its toxic properties, it is often cultivated with caution and is used primarily for its industrial and pharmaceutical potential."
