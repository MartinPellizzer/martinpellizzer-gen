    "intro": "Richea continentis, commonly known as the coastal richea, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy soils along the coastline, where it is adapted to harsh maritime conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers during the spring and summer months, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its leaves are usually narrow and waxy, helping to reduce water loss in salty, windy environments. Richea continentis is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
