    "intro": "Rubus microstemon, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to western North America, characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit, though not as commonly cultivated as other blackberries, is edible and often used in local foraging and traditional practices."
