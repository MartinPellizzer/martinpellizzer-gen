    "intro": "Rhynchostele duvivieriana, commonly known as the Duvivier's rhynchostele, is a rare and unique fern species native to the tropical rainforests of Central and South America. It belongs to the family Blechnaceae and is characterized by its distinctive rhynchostele, a central vascular structure that is highly specialized for efficient water and nutrient transport. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often on rocks or tree trunks, and exhibits a compact, creeping growth habit. Its fronds are usually small, lance-shaped, and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its natural habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhynchostele duvivieriana is considered a vulnerable species in the wild."
