    "intro": "Ribes repens, commonly known as creeping gooseberry, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, oval leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow flowers in early summer, which are followed by small, edible berries that turn from green to red as they mature. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Ribes repens is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in wet areas."
