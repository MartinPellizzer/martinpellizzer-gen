    "intro": "Rubus macrostachys var. laevefactus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, thornless stems and large, aggregate fruits that range in color from dark purple to black. The plant produces white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value."
