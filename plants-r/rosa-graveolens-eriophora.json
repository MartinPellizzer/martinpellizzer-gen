It is characterized by its thorny stems, pinnately compound leaves, and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant produces oval, yellowish fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Its ornamental value and historical use in hedging make it a notable botanical species."
