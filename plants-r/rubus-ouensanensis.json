    "intro": "Rubus ouensanensis, commonly known as the Ouensanese raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
