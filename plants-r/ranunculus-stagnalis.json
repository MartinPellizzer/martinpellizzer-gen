    "intro": "Ranunculus stagnalis, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features striking yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. The plant has a slender, upright stem with alternate, trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed. It thrives in moist or waterlogged soils, often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an indicator species for wetland ecosystems and its historical use in traditional medicine."
