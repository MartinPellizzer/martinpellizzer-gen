    "intro": "Rubus nutans, commonly known as the nodding bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the rose family, Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across various habitats. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that droop downward, giving it its common name. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus nutans is native to parts of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks."
