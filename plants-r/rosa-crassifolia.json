    "intro": "Rosa crassifolia, commonly known as the thick-leaved rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, thriving in well-drained soils. Its stems are often covered in stiff, thorny hairs, providing a natural defense against herbivores. Rosa crassifolia is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
