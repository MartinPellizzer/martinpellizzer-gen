    "intro": "Rumex obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright, branched stems and alternate, heart-shaped to ovate leaves that are often reddish or purple underneath. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
