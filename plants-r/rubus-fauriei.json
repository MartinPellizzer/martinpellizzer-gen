    "intro": "Rubus fauriei, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and bears white to pale pink flowers in the spring. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, and the plant is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Rubus fauriei is also used in traditional Chinese medicine for its purported health benefits."
