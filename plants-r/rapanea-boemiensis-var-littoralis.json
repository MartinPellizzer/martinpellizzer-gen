    "intro": "Rapanea boemiensis var. littoralis, commonly known as the coastal rapanea, is a variant of the rapanea species native to the coastal regions of Central Europe. It is a small evergreen shrub characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves and small, fragrant white flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils along the coast, where it is adapted to salt spray and strong winds. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss, and it produces small, fleshy berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. This plant plays a significant role in stabilizing coastal dunes and preventing erosion."
