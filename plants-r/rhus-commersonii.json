    "intro": "Rhus commersonii, commonly known as the burr oak, is a deciduous tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its thick, fissured bark and large, lobed leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring, followed by distinctive, spiny burrs that enclose its seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along riverbanks. Rhus commersonii is valued for its hardiness and is used in landscaping for its ornamental and ecological benefits."
