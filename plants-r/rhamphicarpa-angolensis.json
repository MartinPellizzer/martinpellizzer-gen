    "intro": "Rhamphicarpa angolensis, commonly known as the Angola ghost flower, is a unique and rare plant species native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its striking, ghost-like appearance, with translucent, waxy leaves that give it a spectral look. The plant thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, often growing in rocky soils and dry grasslands. Its flowers are small and inconspicuous, typically appearing in clusters during the rainy season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
