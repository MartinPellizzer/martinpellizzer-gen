    "intro": "Ranunculus subborealis subsp. villosus, commonly known as the hairy mountain buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its cold, dry habitat. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky or gravelly soils and is often found in mountain meadows and alpine tundra. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator species of high-altitude environments."
