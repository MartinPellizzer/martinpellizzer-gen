    "intro": "Rosa caryophyllacea var. pseudocaryophyllacea, commonly known as the pink sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender, branching stems and small, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture, adapted to the arid and saline conditions of its habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and rocky outcrops. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
