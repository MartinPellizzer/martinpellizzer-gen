It features thorny stems and is characterized by its distinctive, often fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces small, edible fruits that are similar in appearance to apricots, though they are not typically consumed by humans.

This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
