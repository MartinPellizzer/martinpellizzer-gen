    "intro": "Rubus jacens var. blanchardianus, commonly known as the Blanchard's trailing raspberry, is a variant of the trailing raspberry species native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange when ripe, containing multiple drupes. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
