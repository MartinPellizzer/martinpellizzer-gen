    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. obovatus, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often with a distinctive white or greenish center. The leaves are typically lobed and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. This subspecies is characterized by its broader, more rounded leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
