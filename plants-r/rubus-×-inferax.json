    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 inferax, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is both a useful food source and a challenging weed in agricultural settings."
