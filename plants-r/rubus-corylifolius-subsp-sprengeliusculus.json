    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. sprengeliusculus, commonly known as the Sprengel's bramble, is a shrub native to parts of East Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are usually red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or rocky habitats. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for both ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
