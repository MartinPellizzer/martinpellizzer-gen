    "intro": "Rosa mollimaelarensis, commonly known as the Mollimaela rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, typically during the spring season. The plant has slender, thornless stems and heart-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, humid environment to flourish. Due to its limited habitat and endangered status, it is highly valued in botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
