    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. vulgaris, commonly known as the wooly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, white to grayish pubescent foliage and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in pink or white. The plant produces hips, which are the fruit, containing seeds encased in a red, fuzzy covering. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a hedge."
