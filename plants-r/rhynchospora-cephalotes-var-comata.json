It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its cylindrical, spike-like inflorescence that bears small, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and grass-like, with a fibrous root system adapted to waterlogged soils. This variety is distinguished by its hairy or pubescent appearance, particularly on the inflorescence and leaf surfaces."
