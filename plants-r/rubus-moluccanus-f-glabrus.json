    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus f. glabrus, commonly known as the smooth bramble, is a variant of the Moluccan raspberry. It is a shrub native to Australia, characterized by its thornless stems and dense foliage. The plant produces small, aggregate berries that are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are usually ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture due to the absence of hairy covering. This form is notable for its horticultural value and adaptability to various soil conditions."
