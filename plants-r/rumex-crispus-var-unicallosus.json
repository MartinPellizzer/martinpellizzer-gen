    "intro": "Rumex crispus var. unicallosus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its serrated, wavy leaves that are typically narrower than those of the common dock. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often surrounded by bracts. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. Its leaves are sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties."
