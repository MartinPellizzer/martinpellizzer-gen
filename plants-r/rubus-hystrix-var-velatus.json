    "intro": "Rubus hystrix var. velatus, commonly known as the velvety bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense, velvety foliage that gives it its common name. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
