It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 20 centimeters in length, providing dense foliage. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full sunlight for optimal growth. Due to its size and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
