    "intro": "Roegneria glaberrima, commonly known as the smooth wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the northern regions of North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, bluish-green leaves that are typically smooth to the touch. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous slender, two-rowed spikelets. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, disturbed sites such as roadsides and meadows. Roegneria glaberrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant landscaping."
