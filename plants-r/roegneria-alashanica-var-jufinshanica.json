    "intro": "Roegneria alashanica var. jufinshanica, commonly known as the Jufinshanica wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to arid and semi-arid regions of China. It belongs to the Poaceae family and is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with pale green to blue flowers, which are typical of many wheatgrass species. It is adapted to grow in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in dry steppe and desert environments. Due to its drought tolerance, it is considered an important component of local vegetation in its native habitat."
