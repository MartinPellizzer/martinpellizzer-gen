    "intro": "Rhamnus lycioides var. aragonensis, commonly known as the Aragon buckthorn, is a shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, dark red berries that are edible but often bitter. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean scrublands. This variety is distinguished from other Rhamnus species by its specific geographic distribution and morphological features."
