    "intro": "Rhus neoglutinosa, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a key feature of the species. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important plant for both ecological and ornamental purposes."
