    "intro": "Rorippa cryptantha var. mildbraedii, commonly known as the mildbraed's watercress, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist environments such as stream banks, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has slender, branching stems that are often submerged or partially submerged, with small, alternate leaves that are usually lance-shaped. Its flowers are white or pale yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, oval seeds that are dispersed by water. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important crops."
