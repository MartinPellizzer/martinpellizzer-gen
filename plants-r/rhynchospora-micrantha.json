It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, commonly referred to as the sedge family, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant produces small, violet-colored flowers that are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Rhynchospora micrantha typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, and it plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and wildlife. Its botanical features make it an important indicator species for assessing the health of wetland environments."
