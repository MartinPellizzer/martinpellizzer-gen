    "intro": "Rubus pruinosus subsp. maximus, commonly known as the glossy blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dark, glossy leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that ripen to a deep black color. These berries are often used in jams and desserts due to their rich flavor and high acidity. The subsp. maximus is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger, more intensely flavored fruits compared to other Rubus species."
