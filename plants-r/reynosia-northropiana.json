    "intro": "Reynosia northropiana, commonly known as the California buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the coastal regions of California. It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, which are typically oval and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal sage scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can become invasive in certain areas."
