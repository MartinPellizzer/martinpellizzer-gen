    "intro": "Rhododendron purshii, commonly known as the Pursh rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western China and eastern Tibet. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and shrublands, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are often clustered in inflorescences, and the leaves are leathery with a waxy coating. Rhododendron purshii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in regions with similar climatic conditions."
