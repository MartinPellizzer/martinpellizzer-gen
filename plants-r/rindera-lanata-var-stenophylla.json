    "intro": "Rindera lanata var. stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved woolly rindera, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that covers the stems and leaves, providing protection against intense sunlight and water loss. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and is adapted to survive in low-nutrient environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. The flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in spikes, and bloom during the rainy season."
