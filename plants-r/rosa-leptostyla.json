    "intro": "Rosa leptostyla, commonly known as the slender-stemmed rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central America and northern South America. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring upright, often thornless stems covered in dense, grayish-white bark. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double pink or red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. Rosa leptostyla is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
