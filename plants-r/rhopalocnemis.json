    "intro": "Rhopalocnemis, commonly known as the golden-eyed leafhopper, is a genus of plant-hoppers belonging to the family Fulgoridae. These small insects are characterized by their distinctive, often colorful body structures and the presence of prominent eyes. They are primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, where they feed on the sap of various plants. Rhopalocnemis species are known for their ability to camouflage with their host plants, making them difficult to detect. Their botanical significance lies in their role as both herbivores and potential vectors of plant pathogens."
