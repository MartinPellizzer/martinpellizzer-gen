    "intro": "Rubus acaenocalyx, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in high-altitude forests. Due to its ornamental value and potential for cultivation, it is occasionally grown in botanical gardens and for its edible berries."
