    "intro": "Roupala heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf roupala, is a small evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its variable leaf shapes, which range from ovate to elliptical, depending on the growth conditions. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Its leaves are typically glossy and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Roupala heterophylla is often found in coastal and lowland forests, where it thrives in moist, well-drained soils."
