    "intro": "Rondeletia monteverdensis, commonly known as the Monteverde rondeletia, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the family Lythraceae and is characterized by its vibrant red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in the dense canopy of its habitat. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a waxy texture to retain moisture in the humid environment. Rondeletia monteverdensis plays a role in supporting local biodiversity by providing nectar for pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
