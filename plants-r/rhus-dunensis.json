    "intro": "Rhus dunensis, commonly known as the Persian ironwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen shrub or tree native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and small, leathery leaves that provide year-round cover. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers followed by small, red or orange berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Rhus dunensis is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it drought-tolerant and suitable for xeriscaping. Its hardy nature and ornamental value make it a popular choice for landscaping in regions with hot, dry climates."
