    "intro": "Rubus rubristylus, commonly known as the red-styled raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red or orange in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus rubristylus is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
