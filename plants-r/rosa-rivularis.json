It is characterized by its slender, trailing stems that often grow along the edges of water bodies such as streams and ponds. The plant produces small, fragrant white or pink flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and typically have a serrated edge. Rosa rivularis is adapted to moist environments and is often found in riparian habitats."
