    "intro": "Ranunculus sennii, commonly known as the Senn's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, showy flowers with five to eight bright yellow petals and a prominent central pistil, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
