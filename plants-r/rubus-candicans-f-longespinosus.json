    "intro": "Rubus candicans f. longespinosus, commonly known as the long-spined raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its elongated, stiff spines. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is native to regions of South America, particularly Brazil. The plant produces small, red berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. Its foliage consists of compound leaves with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soil with ample sunlight. This form is notable for its increased spination, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
