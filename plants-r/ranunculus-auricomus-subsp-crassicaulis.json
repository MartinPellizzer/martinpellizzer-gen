It features glossy, heart-shaped leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5-10 sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or meadow habitats. It is characterized by its stout, hairy stems and its ability to thrive in cool, temperate climates.
