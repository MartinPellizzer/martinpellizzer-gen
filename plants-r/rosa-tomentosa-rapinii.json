    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa rapinii, commonly known as the Mongolian rose, is a species of shrub native to the cold regions of Mongolia and northern China. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has a compact growth habit and is well adapted to harsh, arid environments. Its leaves are typically covered in a thick layer of white to gray hairs, which help reduce water loss. Rosa tomentosa rapinii is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climate conditions."
