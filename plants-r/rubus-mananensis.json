    "intro": "Rubus mananensis, commonly known as the Mananense raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Philippines. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, thriving in moist, shaded environments. Its fruit is small, aggregate, and usually reddish or purplish in color, with a tart flavor. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and less-studied species within the Rubus family."
