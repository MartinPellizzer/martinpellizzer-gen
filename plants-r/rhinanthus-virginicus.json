    "intro": "Rhinanthus virginicus, commonly known as the yellow goatweed, is a flowering plant native to the eastern United States. It is an annual herb that typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators. Its slender, branched stems are often covered in fine hairs, and its leaves are lance-shaped with a rough texture. Rhinanthus virginicus plays a role in supporting local ecosystems by providing nectar for bees and other insects."
