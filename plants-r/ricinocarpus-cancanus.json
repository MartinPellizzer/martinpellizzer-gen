    "intro": "Ricinocarpus cancanus, commonly known as the white mangrove, is a halophytic tree native to tropical coastal regions. It has thick, fleshy leaves that store water, helping it survive in saline environments. The plant produces small, white flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing seeds. Its roots form a dense network that stabilizes coastal sediments and prevents erosion. Ricinocarpus cancanus plays a vital role in mangrove ecosystems by providing habitat and shelter for various marine and terrestrial species."
