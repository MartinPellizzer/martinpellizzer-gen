    "intro": "Rosa schemnitzensis, commonly known as the Schemnitz rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the Carpathian Mountains. It is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-red flowers and thorny stems. The plant typically grows in rocky, forested areas and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Rosa schemnitzensis has small, lobed leaves and produces fragrant blooms in late spring to early summer. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
