    "intro": "Rosa umbelliflora, commonly known as the umbrella flower rose, is a species native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. The plant produces fragrant, white to pale pink flowers in clusters, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Its botanical name reflects the umbrella-like arrangement of its flower heads, a distinctive feature of the species. Rosa umbelliflora is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
