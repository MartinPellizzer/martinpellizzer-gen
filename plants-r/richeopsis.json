It is characterized by its showy yellow or orange ray flowers and a central disk of tubular florets. The plants typically have basal leaves that are lobed or dissected, and they often grow in arid or semi-arid environments. Richeopsis species are native to Mexico and the southwestern United States, and they are often found in rocky soils. Some species are cultivated for their ornamental value due to their vibrant floral display."
