    "intro": "Riedlea caracasana, commonly known as the Caracasana riedlea, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to the Caribbean. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with a glossy surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by orange-red berries. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in coastal areas and forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
