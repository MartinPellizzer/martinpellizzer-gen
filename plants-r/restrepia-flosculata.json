    "intro": "Restrepia flosculata, commonly known as the miniature orchid or the dwarf orchid, is a species of orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is a small, epiphytic plant that typically grows on trees or rocks in humid, shaded environments. The plant features delicate, greenish-white flowers that bloom in late winter or early spring. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the air, and it thrives in cool, high-altitude conditions. Due to its compact size and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for indoor cultivation."
