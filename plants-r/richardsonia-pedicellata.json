    "intro": "Richardsonia pedicellata, commonly known as the pink sandalwood, is a rare and critically endangered plant species native to the Hawaiian Islands. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its pale pink or white flowers and aromatic, fragrant leaves. The plant is notable for its unique morphology, including its clustered inflorescences and specialized root system adapted to nutrient-poor soils. It plays an important ecological role in its native habitat, supporting various pollinators and contributing to forest biodiversity. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect this rare species from extinction due to habitat loss and invasive species."
