    "intro": "Retinispora lycopodioides, commonly known as the dwarf clubmoss, is a species of spore-bearing plant belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is a small, evergreen shrub characterized by its compact growth habit and needle-like leaves. The plant produces small, cone-like structures called strobili, which contain the spores for reproduction. Retinispora lycopodioides typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky crevices. Its simple, primitive structure reflects its ancient lineage among the vascular plants."
