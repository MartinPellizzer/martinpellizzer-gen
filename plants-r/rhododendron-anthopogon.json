    "intro": "Rhododendron anthopogon, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and relatively compact size make it suitable for smaller garden spaces."
