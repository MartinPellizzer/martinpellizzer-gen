    "intro": "Rupicapnos fraterna, commonly known as the fraternals or mountain snowbells, is a species of flowering plant in the family Polemoniaceae. It is native to the western United States, particularly in areas with high elevations and rocky soils. The plant is characterized by its bell-shaped, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. Rupicapnos fraterna is typically found in open woodlands and meadows, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
