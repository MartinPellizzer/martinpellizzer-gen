    "intro": "Rohdea tupistra, commonly known as the mountain fern, is a perennial plant native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that forms a rosette pattern. The plant features lance-shaped leaves with a waxy texture, which help it retain moisture in its natural habitat. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by spore-bearing cones. Rohdea tupistra is often cultivated for its ornamental value and its ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
