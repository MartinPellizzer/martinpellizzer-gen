    "intro": "Ruellia japurensis, commonly known as the Brazilian bluebell, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Amazon rainforest. It is characterized by its striking blue-violet flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant has lance-shaped leaves with a smooth texture and can grow up to 1 meter in height. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in the undergrowth of tropical forests. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in subtropical regions."
