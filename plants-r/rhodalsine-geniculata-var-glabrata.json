It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) leaves and distinctive floral structure, which includes showy, clustered blooms. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in cloud forests or mountainous regions. Its botanical features are adapted to its specific ecological niche, making it an important subject for botanical research. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is the focus of conservation efforts."
