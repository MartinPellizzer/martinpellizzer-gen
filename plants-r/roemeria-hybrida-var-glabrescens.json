It features upright, branching stems that are covered in smooth, glabrous foliage. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a desirable plant for botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
