It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branched stems and bright yellow flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its unique floral structure and ecological role make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
