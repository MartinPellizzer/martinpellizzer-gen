    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. petiolulatus, commonly known as the yellow pond-lily, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features floating leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green color and showy yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant has a short, stout stem that supports its broad, heart-shaped leaves, which are often covered in fine hairs. Its flowers consist of five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats and plays a role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
