    "intro": "Rhodanthemum depressum, commonly known as the creeping chrysanthemum, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, daisy-like flowers that range in color from white to pale yellow, typically blooming in late summer to early autumn. The plant has a compact, mat-forming growth habit with hairy, grayish-green leaves that help it retain moisture. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract beneficial insects such as bees and butterflies."
