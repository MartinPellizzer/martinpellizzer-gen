    "intro": "Reichardia tingitana var. subintegra, commonly known as the Atlantic coast sandwort, is a low-growing, mat-forming plant native to the coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to saline and coastal environments. The plant features small, succulent leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically pink or white, arranged in dense clusters, and it blooms from spring to early summer. It plays a role in stabilizing dunes and is often found in maritime climates."
