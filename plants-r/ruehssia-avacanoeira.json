    "intro": "Ruehssia avacanoeira, commonly known as the Brazilian ironwood, is a tropical tree native to South America, particularly Brazil. It is characterized by its dense, hard wood that is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The plant has compound leaves with elongated, lance-shaped leaflets that are arranged oppositely along the stems. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by woody pods containing oval seeds. Due to its ecological and economic importance, it is often found in lowland rainforests and is a key species in reforestation efforts."
