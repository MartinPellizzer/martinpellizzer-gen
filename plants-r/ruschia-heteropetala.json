    "intro": "Ruschia heteropetala, commonly known as the variable Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features rosettes of fleshy, blue-green leaves that are often tinged with red or purple. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red during the warmer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental appeal, it is a popular choice for xeriscaping."
