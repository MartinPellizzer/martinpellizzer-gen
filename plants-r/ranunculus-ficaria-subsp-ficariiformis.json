    "intro": "Ranunculus ficaria subsp. ficariiformis, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has smooth, glossy leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas and along stream banks. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread rapidly, making it both a common weed and a popular garden plant."
