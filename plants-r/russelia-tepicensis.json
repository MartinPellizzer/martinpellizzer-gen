    "intro": "Russelia tepicensis, commonly known as the Mexican flamebush, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its vibrant red or orange tubular flowers that bloom in clusters during the summer months. The plant is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching heights of up to 6 meters, with lance-shaped, opposite leaves. Its flowers attract hummingbirds and other pollinators due to their nectar-rich structure. Russelia tepicensis is well-suited for cultivation in warm climates and is often used in ornamental gardening."
