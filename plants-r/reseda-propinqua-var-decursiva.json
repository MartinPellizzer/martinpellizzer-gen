    "intro": "Reseda propinqua var. decursiva, commonly known as creeping reseda, is a low-growing herbaceous plant native to southern Europe and parts of western Asia. It features slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. Its leaves are narrow and lance-shaped, with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed or rocky habitats."
