    "intro": "Rubus ellipticus var. flavus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a variant of the elliptic raspberry species native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-red fruits that are typically smaller than those of the common raspberry. Its leaves are elliptical in shape with serrated edges, and it blooms with white flowers in the spring. The yellow raspberry is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique fruit color and fragrance."
