    "intro": "Ranunculus multifidus var. repens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with rhizomes that allow it to colonize moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and wet meadows. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with 5-15 petals, typically blooming from May to July. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that aids in identification. The species is often considered invasive in certain regions due to its rapid spread and ability to thrive in wet environments."
