    "intro": "Robinia altagana, commonly known as the golden robinia, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 10\u201320 cm long and consist of 10\u201325 pairs of ovate to lanceolate leaflets. The tree produces showy, fragrant yellow flowers in late winter to early spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is smooth and light gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia altagana is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soils and its use in reforestation projects."
