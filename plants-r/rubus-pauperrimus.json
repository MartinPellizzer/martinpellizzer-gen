    "intro": "Rubus pauperrimus, commonly known as the poor man's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as forest understories and along streambanks. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in disturbed soils and is considered a pioneer species in certain ecosystems."
