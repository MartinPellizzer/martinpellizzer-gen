    "intro": "Rhus nelsonii, commonly known as the Nelson's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, and its clusters of small, fragrant, white flowers. The plant produces red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals but not typically for humans. It thrives in arid and semi-arid environments, making it well adapted to harsh, dry climates. Its botanical features make it an important species in desert ecosystems and a common sight in regions like Texas and New Mexico."
