    "intro": "Rosa obornyana, commonly known as the Tibetan rose or Himalayan rose, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky and alpine environments, thriving at elevations between 2,500 and 5,000 meters. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, arid conditions. Rosa obornyana is valued for its ornamental beauty and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential healing properties."
