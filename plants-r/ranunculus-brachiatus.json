It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often colorful flowers. The plant typically features a short stem with compound leaves that are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and it produces small, green fruits that contain several seeds.
