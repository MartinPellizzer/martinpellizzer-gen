    "intro": "Riedelia minor, commonly known as the dwarf riedelia, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Canary Islands. It belongs to the family Cistaceae and is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense foliage. The plant features small, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hair, giving it a silvery appearance. It produces small, yellowish flowers that bloom in spring, adding a delicate touch to its appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Riedelia minor is considered a rare and endangered species."
