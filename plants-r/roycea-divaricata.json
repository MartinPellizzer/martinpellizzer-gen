    "intro": "Roycea divaricata, commonly known as the rock orchid, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine environments. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a rhizomatous root system that helps it survive in harsh conditions. Roycea divaricata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
