    "intro": "Reynosia, commonly known as the desert willow, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Reynosia tridentata, which is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant is characterized by its slender, often twisted stems and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, or white. Its leaves are typically narrow and opposite, and it thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Reynosia is well adapted to dry conditions, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping and native plant gardens."
