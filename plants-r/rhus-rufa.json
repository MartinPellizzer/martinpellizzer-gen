It typically grows to a height of 3 to 10 feet, featuring compound leaves that are pinnately arranged with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is smooth and gray, and it is often found in open woodlands or along stream banks. Rhus rufa is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local ecosystems."
