    "intro": "Rubus vrabelyianus, commonly known as the Vrabel's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the forests of eastern Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
