    "intro": "Rubus dissectifolius, commonly known as the dissect-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are deeply lobed, giving it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as blackberries, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
