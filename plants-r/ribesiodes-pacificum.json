    "intro": "Ribesiodes pacificum, commonly known as the Pacific gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western coast of North America. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-white flowers in early spring, followed by edible berries that turn red when mature. These berries are often used in jams and jellies due to their tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal forests and streamside habitats."
