It is characterized by its glossy, oval-shaped leaves and small, fragrant pink or red flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, blue-black berries that are edible but not typically consumed by humans. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and subtropical regions. Rhodomyrtus parvifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is also used in traditional medicine."
