It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender-colored flowers and slightly hairy foliage. This form is typically smaller than the standard Rosa glauca, with a more compact growth habit. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Its unique coloration and ornamental value make it a prized addition to botanical collections."
