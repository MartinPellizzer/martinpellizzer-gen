    "intro": "Roegneria racemifera, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a species of grass native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, tufted growth habit and produces slender, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a bluish-green hue, and it is often found in high-altitude meadows. Roegneria racemifera is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
