    "intro": "Ranunculus bipinnatus, commonly known as the two-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant has a hairy stem that is usually branched and grows up to 30 cm in height. Its leaves are deeply lobed, with a distinctive bipinnate structure, giving it a feathery appearance. Ranunculus bipinnatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
