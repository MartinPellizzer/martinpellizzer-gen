    "intro": "Rubus stormanicus, commonly known as the storman blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of eastern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in forested or rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and somewhat endangered species in its native range."
