    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. rotundata, commonly known as the woolly rose or round-leaved shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, single or semi-double pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broadly ovate with a rounded base and are also covered in fine hairs. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
