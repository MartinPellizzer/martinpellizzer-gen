    "intro": "Rubus vallisparsus subsp. brevipetiolulatus, commonly known as the short-petiole blackberry, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible but generally less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a slightly serrated edge. This subspecies is adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests."
