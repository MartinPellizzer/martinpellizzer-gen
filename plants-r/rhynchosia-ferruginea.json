    "intro": "Rhynchosia ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty thorn or red thorn, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. It has a deep root system that helps it thrive in poor soils, and it is sometimes used in traditional medicine. The seeds are dispersed by animals that eat the pods, contributing to its spread in the wild."
