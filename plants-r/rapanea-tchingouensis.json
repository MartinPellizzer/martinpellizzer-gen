    "intro": "Rapanea tchingouensis, commonly known as the Tchingou holly, is a species of flowering plant in the family Ericaceae. It is native to the mountainous regions of southern China, particularly in Yunnan Province. The plant is characterized by its evergreen leaves, which are glossy and arranged alternately along the stems. It produces small, white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by bright red berries that are a source of food for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
