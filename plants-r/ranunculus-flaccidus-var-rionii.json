    "intro": "Ranunculus flaccidus var. rionii, commonly known as the Rion Mountains buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the Appalachian Mountains. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, shaded habitats such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
