    "intro": "Rubus haesitans, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when ripe. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks. Due to its thorny stems and edible fruits, it plays an important role in local ecosystems and has some historical use in herbal medicine."
