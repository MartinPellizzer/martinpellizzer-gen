    "intro": "Rubus laurocerasus, commonly known as the common blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, alternate leaves with serrated edges, and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a deep purple or black color, typically in late summer. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile ground. The species is often used in hedges due to its dense growth and attractive foliage."
