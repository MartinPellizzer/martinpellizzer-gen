The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender stalks. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is commonly found in wetlands, ditches, and along stream banks. Rumex \u00d7 conspersus is a perennial herb that can spread through both seeds and rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
