    "intro": "Rea pruinata, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a species native to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. It is characterized by its silvery-white, waxy coating on its leaves, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, round fruits. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and often have a distinctive heart-shaped base. Rea pruinata is often used in traditional medicine and is valued for its ornamental appearance."
