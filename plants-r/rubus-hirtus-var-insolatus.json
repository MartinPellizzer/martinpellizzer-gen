    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. insolatus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it spreads through both seeds and vegetative growth. This species is valued for its edible fruits and its role in supporting local wildlife."
