    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus subsp. gallicus, commonly known as the Gallic dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils, often found in wetlands, marshes, and along riverbanks. The plant features basal leaves that are broadly triangular with wavy margins and reddish veins, and it produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in spring. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. The species is characterized by its distinctive leaf shape and its ability to thrive in wetland environments."
