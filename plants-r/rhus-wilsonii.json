    "intro": "Rhus wilsonii, commonly known as the Wilson's sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries, which are a food source for birds and mammals. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in swamps, floodplains, and along streambanks. The species is valued for its ecological role and ornamental qualities in wetland landscapes."
