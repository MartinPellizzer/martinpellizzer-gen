    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruit surface, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupelets that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are alternate, serrated, and have a hairy texture, typical of many Rubus species. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or thicket environments."
