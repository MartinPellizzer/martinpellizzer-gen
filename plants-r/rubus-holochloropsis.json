    "intro": "Rubus holochloropsis, commonly known as the yellow-tipped blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to eastern North America, characterized by its stout, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature, though some varieties may have a yellowish tinge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and wild areas."
