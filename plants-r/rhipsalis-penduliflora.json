    "intro": "Rhipsalis penduliflora, commonly known as the hanging rhipsalis, is a species of cactus native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its long, pendulous stems that can reach several meters in length, often hanging from trees or growing epiphytically. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom during the rainy season, typically in the summer months. Its leaves are reduced to small, hair-like structures, and it lacks true leaves, relying on photosynthesis through its stems. Rhipsalis penduliflora is well adapted to humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant for its unique appearance."
