    "intro": "Robinia hispida var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf false acacia, is a compact shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, dark green leaves that are densely hairy, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant, yellow pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by woody, pod-like fruits. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established. Its slow growth rate and dense foliage make it an attractive choice for small garden spaces or as a hedge."
