    "intro": "Rumex salicifolius subsp. mexicanus, commonly known as Mexican dock, is a perennial herb native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, greenish flowers that are typically arranged in a spike-like inflorescence. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and along roadsides. Its botanical characteristics make it a common weed in agricultural and urban environments."
