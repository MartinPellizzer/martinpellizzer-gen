    "intro": "Rhododendron canescens var. candidum, commonly known as the white alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, bell-shaped white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments with well-drained soil and partial shade. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, whitish pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural alpine habitat."
