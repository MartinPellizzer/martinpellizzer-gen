    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 affinoides, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in moist, temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along stream edges. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are a mix of blackberry and raspberry flavors. This hybrid is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
