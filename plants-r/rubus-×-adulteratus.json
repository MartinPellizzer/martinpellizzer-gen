    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 adulteratus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (the European blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the red raspberry). This plant typically produces fruit that is a mix of the characteristics of both parent species, often resulting in a dark red to nearly black berry. The botanical features include thorny stems, pinnate leaves, and aggregate fruits composed of small drupelets. It is often found in temperate regions where the parent species overlap geographically."
