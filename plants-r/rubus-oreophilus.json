    "intro": "Rubus oreophilus, commonly known as the mountain raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ecological importance and ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
