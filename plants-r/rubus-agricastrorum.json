    "intro": "Rubus agricastrorum, commonly known as the agricola raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant produces white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, shady environments, often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its berries are edible, though they are generally less palatable than those of other Rubus species."
