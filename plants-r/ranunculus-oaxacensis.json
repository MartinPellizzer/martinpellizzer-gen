    "intro": "Ranunculus oaxacensis, commonly known as the Oaxaca buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Mexico. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse seeds by wind. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
