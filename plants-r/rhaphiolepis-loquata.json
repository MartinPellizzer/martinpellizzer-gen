    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis loquata, commonly known as the Chinese holly or winter holly, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its bright red berries. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, followed by ornamental berries that persist through the winter. It is often cultivated for its winter interest and is suitable for hedges or as a specimen plant. Rhaphiolepis loquata is relatively low maintenance and thrives in full sun to partial shade."
