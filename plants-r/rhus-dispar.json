    "intro": "Rhus dispar, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Rhus dispar thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, open woods, and disturbed sites. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it a common sight in many eastern U.S. landscapes."
