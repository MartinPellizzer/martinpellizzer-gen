    "intro": "Rubus caliginosus, commonly known as the misty blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in the spring. Its fruit, a dark purple to black berry, develops in the summer and is edible, though often tart and less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and contributing to soil stability."
