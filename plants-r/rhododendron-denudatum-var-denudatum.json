    "intro": "Rhododendron denudatum var. denudatum, commonly known as the naked-leaved rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It is characterized by its striking, large, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink to reddish in color. The leaves are narrowly elliptical and turn yellow in autumn before falling off, giving the plant its \"naked\" appearance in winter. It prefers well-drained, acidic soils and partial to full shade. This species is valued for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral displays."
