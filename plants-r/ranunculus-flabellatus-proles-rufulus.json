    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus proles rufulus, commonly known as the yellow flag iris, is a flowering plant native to wetland areas in Europe and parts of Asia. It features showy, yellow to orange flowers with six petals and a prominent yellow center, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, sword-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating in water, aiding in its aquatic habitat. It grows in shallow water or moist soil, and its rhizomatous root system helps it spread and colonize new areas. This species is often found in marshes, pond edges, and along riverbanks, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for aquatic life."
