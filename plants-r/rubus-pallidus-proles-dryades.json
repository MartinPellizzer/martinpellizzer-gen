It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries in the fall. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and wines."
