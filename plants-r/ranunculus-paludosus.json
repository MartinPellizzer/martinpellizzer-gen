    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus, commonly known as the marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features glossy, waxy leaves that are typically divided into three to five segments, and its flowers are bright yellow with numerous stamens. The plant thrives in moist, often acidic soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ranunculus paludosus is characterized by its ability to tolerate waterlogged conditions, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems."
