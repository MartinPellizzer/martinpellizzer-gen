    "intro": "Ribes macrostachyum, commonly known as the giant gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its large, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of yellow, bell-shaped flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, orange-red berries. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are used both for culinary purposes and in traditional medicine. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation in temperate climates."
