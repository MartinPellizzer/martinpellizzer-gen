    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. burgalensis, commonly known as the Burgalense Raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering its stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the cultivar. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for its unique foliage and fruit characteristics."
