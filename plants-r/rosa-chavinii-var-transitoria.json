    "intro": "Rosa chavinii var. transitoria, commonly known as the Chavin rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the high Andes of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant has small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture and thrives in cool, moist environments. It is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in Andean culture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
