    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of heart-shaped, bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are short and often prostrate. Ranunculus flammula is known for its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats, making it both a common weed and an early indicator of soil moisture."
