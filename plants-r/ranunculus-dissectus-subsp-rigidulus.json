    "intro": "Ranunculus dissectus subsp. rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely dissected, fern-like leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its leaves and flowers are covered in fine hairs, and it is known for its delicate, cup-shaped petals. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
