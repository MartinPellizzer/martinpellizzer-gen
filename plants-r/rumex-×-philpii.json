    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 philpii, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved dock). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple tinge on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations depending on the parent species involved."
