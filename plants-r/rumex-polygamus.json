    "intro": "Rumex polygamus, commonly known as the common dock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the summer, which are followed by elongated, ribbed seed pods. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. The species is known for its medicinal properties and has been used historically for its astringent and anti-inflammatory effects."
