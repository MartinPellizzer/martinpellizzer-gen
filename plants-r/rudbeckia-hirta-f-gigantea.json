    "intro": "Rudbeckia hirta f. gigantea, commonly known as the giant swamp coneflower, is a striking variant of the common coneflower. It is characterized by its large, showy yellow daisy-like flowers with a prominent brown central disk. The plant typically grows in wet or moist habitats such as marshes and swamps, thriving in full sun to partial shade. Its foliage is lance-shaped and covered in fine, hairy textures, contributing to its rugged appearance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to attract pollinators like bees and butterflies."
