    "intro": "Racosperma pinguiculosum subsp. teretifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, elongated leaves that are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular or cylindrical clusters, which are typical of the Acacia genus. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in arid and semi-arid regions. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in revegetation projects in degraded landscapes."
