    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens f. abortiva, commonly known as the evergreen rose or the white evergreen rose, is a unique form of the evergreen rose that exhibits distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its persistent, leathery leaves that remain on the plant throughout the year, distinguishing it from its deciduous relatives. The flowers are typically smaller and more pale in color compared to the standard Rosa sempervirens, often appearing in clusters. This form is notable for its ability to thrive in coastal environments due to its salt tolerance and resilience. Its botanical interest lies in its horticultural variability and adaptability to different climates."
