    "intro": "Ranunculus gongheensis, commonly known as the Gonghe buttercup, is a rare and endemic species native to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. It is characterized by its striking yellow flowers with deeply lobed petals and a prominent central pistil. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows at high elevations, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided and covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, which helps to reduce water loss in its harsh environment. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species facing threats from climate change and habitat degradation."
