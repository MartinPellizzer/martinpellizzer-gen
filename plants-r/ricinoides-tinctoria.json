    "intro": "Ricinoides tinctoria, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a halophytic shrub that thrives in coastal and estuarine environments. It is characterized by its unique adaptations to saline conditions, including salt-excreting glands on its leaves. The plant produces small, pinkish flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries containing seeds. Its roots form a complex network that helps stabilize shorelines and prevent erosion. Ricinoides tinctoria plays a vital role in the ecological balance of mangrove ecosystems."
