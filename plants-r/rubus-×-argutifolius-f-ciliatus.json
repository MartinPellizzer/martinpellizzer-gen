    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 argutifolius f. ciliatus, commonly known as the hairy-leaf blackberry, is a hybrid shrub in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its compound leaves with serrated edges and hairy surfaces, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it both ecologically significant and a subject of interest in horticultural studies."
