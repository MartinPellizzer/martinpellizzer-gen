    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. fascifoliata, commonly known as the Broad-leaved shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features dense, arching stems covered in dark green, leathery leaves that are broader than those of the typical Rosa obtusifolia. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is distinctive for its broad, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly wavy margin. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in gardens."
