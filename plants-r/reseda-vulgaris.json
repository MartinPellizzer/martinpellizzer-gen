It features erect, branched stems that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy on the upper surface. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in fields, roadsides, and waste areas. Botanically, it is valued for its ability to fix nitrogen and its historical use in dye production."
