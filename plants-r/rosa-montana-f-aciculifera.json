    "intro": "Rosa montana f. aciculifera, commonly known as the needle-leaf rock rose, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Europe. It features dense clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has needle-like leaves that are dark green and provide year-round interest in gardens. It is well-suited for rock gardens, borders, or as a ground cover due to its low-growing habit. Its hardy nature makes it adaptable to a variety of soil types and climates."
