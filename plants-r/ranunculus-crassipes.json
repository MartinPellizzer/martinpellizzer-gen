    "intro": "Ranunculus crassipes, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland and aquatic environments in Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals and a central cluster of stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant has broad, heart-shaped leaves that are usually floating on the water surface, with long, slender petioles. Its roots are adapted to aquatic conditions, allowing it to thrive in shallow water or muddy soils. Ranunculus crassipes is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
