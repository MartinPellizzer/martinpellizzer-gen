    "intro": "Rubus fagifolius, commonly known as the hazelnut blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, with the central leaflet often resembling a hazelnut leaf. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to blackberries but have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
