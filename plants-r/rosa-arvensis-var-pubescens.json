It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as fields and roadsides. The plant features thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are pink to red, often with a white base, and appear in clusters. The variety is distinguished by its hairy (pubescent) stems and leaves, which give it its scientific name."
