    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. dolosa, commonly known as the Dolosa rose, is a shrub-like plant native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as hips, which are orange-red and contain numerous seeds. These hips are often used in traditional medicine and as a source of vitamin C. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun, making it adaptable to a variety of garden environments."
