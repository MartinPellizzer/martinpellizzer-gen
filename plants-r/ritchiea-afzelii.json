It is characterized by its tall, unbranched stem and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces cones rather than flowers, with male and female cones occurring on separate plants. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, showcasing a slow growth rate and long lifespan. Due to its unique morphology and ecological significance, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists alike."
