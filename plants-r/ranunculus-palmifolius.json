    "intro": "Ranunculus palmifolius, commonly known as the broad-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of large, palmately lobed leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
