    "intro": "Rhododendron dasylepis, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath, and it produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple. Rhododendron dasylepis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in cooler climates. It plays an important ecological role in its native environment by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
