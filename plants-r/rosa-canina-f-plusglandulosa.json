    "intro": "Rosa canina f. plusglandulosa, commonly known as the glandular hip rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive glandular structures on the stems and leaves, which give it its specific epithet. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, hairy hips that are a notable feature. It is native to Europe and thrives in woodland and scrub habitats. The glandular features contribute to its unique ecological role and horticultural interest."
