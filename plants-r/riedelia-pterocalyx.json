    "intro": "Riedelia pterocalyx, commonly known as the velvetleaf sandmat, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It belongs to the family Malvaceae, which includes cotton and hibiscus, and is characterized by its hairy, woody stems and broad, heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, often during the spring and summer months. Its fibrous roots help it retain moisture in dry environments, making it well adapted to desert conditions. Riedelia pterocalyx is often found in rocky soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
