    "intro": "Rorippa spasskajae, commonly known as the Spasskaja water-cress, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of eastern Europe and western Siberia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes other mustard family plants. The plant is characterized by its small, bright green leaves and clusters of tiny white flowers that bloom in the summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found near ponds, marshes, and slow-moving streams. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
