    "intro": "Rubus siemianicensis, commonly known as the Siemianice blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Southeast Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
