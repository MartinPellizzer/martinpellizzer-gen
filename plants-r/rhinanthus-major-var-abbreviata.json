    "intro": "Rhinanthus major var. abbreviata, commonly known as the short-styled common tickseed, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its short-styled form distinguishes it from other varieties within the Rhinanthus genus."
