    "intro": "Ranunculus speciosus, commonly known as the showy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features striking, palmately lobed leaves and bright yellow, petal-less flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with slender, hairy stems that support its showy inflorescence. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its botanical characteristics make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance ornamental plant."
