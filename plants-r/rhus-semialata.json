    "intro": "Rhus semialata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are arranged in pairs along the stem and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy berries. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive, rough texture that gives it its common name. Rhus semialata is often found in moist soils near streams, wetlands, and along forest edges."
