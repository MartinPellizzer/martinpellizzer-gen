    "intro": "Ruta rosmarinifolia, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features aromatic, dark green, pinnately compound leaves with a strong, pungent odor. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or dry habitats. Its essential oils, derived from the leaves, have been traditionally used in herbal medicine and as a natural insect repellent."
