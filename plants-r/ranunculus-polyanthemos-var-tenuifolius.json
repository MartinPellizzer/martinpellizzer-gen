    "intro": "Ranunculus polyanthemos var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often adorned with a dark center, and is known for its early spring blooming period. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and emit a mild, sometimes irritating odor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but requires careful management to prevent its spread into natural habitats."
