    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. pseudorhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian shrub rose, is a variant of the coral tree rose native to the Alps. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers in early summer, followed by red-orange hips. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with elliptical leaflets that are hairy beneath. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
