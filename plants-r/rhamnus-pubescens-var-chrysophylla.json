It is characterized by its smooth, dark green leaves that turn a striking yellow in the fall, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for landscaping in temperate climates."
