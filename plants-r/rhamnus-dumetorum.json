    "intro": "Rhamnus dumetorum, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, western Asia, and North Africa. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval leaves with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries in the fall. Its berries are toxic to humans and animals, containing compounds like anthraquinones. Rhamnus dumetorum is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it plays a role in supporting local wildlife despite its poisonous nature."
