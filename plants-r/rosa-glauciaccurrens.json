    "intro": "Rosa glauciaccurrens, commonly known as the blue-leaf rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue-green foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and is well adapted to dry, rocky soils. Its botanical significance lies in its unique coloration and potential for hybridization with other rose species. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable subject for horticultural and botanical research."
