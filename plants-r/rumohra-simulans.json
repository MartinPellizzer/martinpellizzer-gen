It is characterized by its distinctive fronds that are covered in fine, silvery hairs, giving it a unique appearance. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its leaves are pinnately divided, with a basal rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. Rumohra simulans plays an important ecological role in New Zealand's native ecosystems."
