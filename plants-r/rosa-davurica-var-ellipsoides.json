    "intro": "Rosa davurica var. ellipsoides, commonly known as the Siberian sand rose, is a perennial shrub native to the cold climates of Siberia and northern China. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves that are densely covered with fine hairs, giving it a slightly fuzzy appearance. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to rock gardens or borders. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a popular choice for gardeners in colder regions."
