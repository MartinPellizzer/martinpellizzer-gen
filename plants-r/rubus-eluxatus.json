    "intro": "Rubus eluxatus, commonly known as the white-tailed blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that give way to dark purple berries, which are edible but often tart. It thrives in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, with unique adaptations for its native habitat."
