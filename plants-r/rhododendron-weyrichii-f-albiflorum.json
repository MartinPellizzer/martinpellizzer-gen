    "intro": "Rhododendron weyrichii f. albiflorum, commonly known as the White-flowered Weyrich Rhododendron, is a rare and unique cultivar within the Rhododendron genus. It is characterized by its striking white flowers, which contrast sharply with its deep green foliage. This form is a natural mutation of the parent species, Rhododendron weyrichii, and is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. Its botanical interest lies in its ornamental value and its role in the study of rhododendron genetics and horticultural variation."
