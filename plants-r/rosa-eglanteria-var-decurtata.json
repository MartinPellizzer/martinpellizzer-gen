    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. decurtata, commonly known as the cut-leaved dog\u73ab\u7470, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its pinnately compound leaves that are often deeply lobed and have a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its visual interest. However, it is also known for its thorny stems and can be somewhat invasive in certain regions."
