    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. genuina, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a rare and delicate plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a low-growing shrub with simple, often hairy leaves and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its botanical features include a woody stem, trifoliate leaves, and a compact growth habit adapted to harsh mountain climates. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
