It is characterized by its smooth, often hairy leaves and clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and swampy areas. Its flowers are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in humid, tropical climates."
