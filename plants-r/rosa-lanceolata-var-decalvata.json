    "intro": "Rosa lanceolata var. decalvata, commonly known as the naked-stemmed shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, thorny stems that are often leafless during the winter months, giving it its common name. The plant produces fragrant, single or double pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets that are typically hairy on the underside. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in colder climates."
