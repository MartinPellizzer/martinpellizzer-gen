    "intro": "Rorippa uliginosa, commonly known as greater water parsley, is a herbaceous aquatic plant native to wetlands and marshy areas. It has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic environments. Rorippa uliginosa is often used in wetland restoration projects due to its ability to tolerate and thrive in waterlogged conditions."
