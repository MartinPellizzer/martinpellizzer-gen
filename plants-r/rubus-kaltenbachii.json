    "intro": "Rubus kaltenbachii, commonly known as the Kaltenbach blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial shade, often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
