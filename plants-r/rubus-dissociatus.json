    "intro": "Rubus dissociatus, commonly known as the dissociated blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Chile. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and they appear in clusters during the spring. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rubus dissociatus is considered a rare and endangered species."
