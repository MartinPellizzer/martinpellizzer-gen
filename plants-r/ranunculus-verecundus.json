    "intro": "Ranunculus verecundus, commonly known as the shy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows to a height of about 15\u201330 centimeters and prefers well-drained, moist soils in partial shade. Its flowers are often short-lived, lasting only a few days, and it is known for its modest and retiring appearance. Ranunculus verecundus is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is relatively easy to cultivate in suitable conditions."
