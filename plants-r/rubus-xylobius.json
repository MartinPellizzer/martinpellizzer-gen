It is native to the southeastern United States, where it thrives in moist, woodsy habitats. The plant produces small, edible red berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a more acidic flavor. Its leaves are compound, typically consisting of three leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities, with its clusters of white flowers appearing in the spring."
