    "intro": "Rhododendron reticulatum var. wadanum, commonly known as the Wadanum azalea, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features dense, dark green foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy, tubular flowers. The blooms, which are typically pink to purple in color, appear in late spring and are highly fragrant. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact growth habit. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial shade to full sun for optimal growth."
