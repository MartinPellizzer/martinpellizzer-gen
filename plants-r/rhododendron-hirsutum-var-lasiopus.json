    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. lasiopus, commonly known as the woolly alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that provides insulation against cold temperatures. The plant produces clusters of showy, pink to purple flowers in the spring, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and requires partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climatic conditions."
