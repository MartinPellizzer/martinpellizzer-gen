    "intro": "Reynosia jamaicensis, commonly known as the Jamaican reynosia, is a species of flowering plant in the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, and is characterized by its woody stems and alternate leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in cyathia, a feature common in the Euphorbiaceae family. Reynosia jamaicensis is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks. Its botanical significance lies in its role as part of the regional flora and its potential ecological interactions within its native environment."
