    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. spiniger, commonly known as brambles or blackberries, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves that are usually serrated and have a distinctive leaflet arrangement. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible berries that ripen in late summer or early autumn. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils and full sun to partial shade. This species is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas due to its adaptability and aggressive growth habit."
