    "intro": "Ranunculus pantothrix, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky habitats at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by distinctive leaflets. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant produces achenes as its seeds. Ranunculus pantothrix is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
