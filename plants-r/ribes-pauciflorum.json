It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and streambanks. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. The fruit, a small, tart berry, ripens in late summer and is often consumed by birds and wildlife."
