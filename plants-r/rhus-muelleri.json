    "intro": "Rhus muelleri, commonly known as the Mueller's sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 9 to 15 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are edible for some animals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and open forest habitats. Rhus muelleri is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local wildlife."
