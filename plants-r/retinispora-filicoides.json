    "intro": "Retinispora filicoides, commonly known as the fern-like lichen, is a unique plant that exhibits characteristics of both ferns and lichens. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure. The plant forms a symbiotic relationship with algae or cyanobacteria, which provide it with nutrients through photosynthesis. Retinispora filicoides typically grows on tree trunks and rocks in moist, shaded environments. Its appearance resembles a delicate fern, contributing to its common name."
