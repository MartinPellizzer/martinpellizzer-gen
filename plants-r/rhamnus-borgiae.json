    "intro": "Rhamnus borgiae, commonly known as Borgia's buckthorn, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are typically consumed by local wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its restricted habitat, Rhamnus borgiae is considered a rare and endangered species."
