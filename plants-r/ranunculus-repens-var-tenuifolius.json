    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a low-growing herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has thin, trifoliate leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in moist, often calcareous soils. It is commonly found in meadows, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. This variety is noted for its rapid spreading habit through stolons, making it a persistent weed in certain habitats."
