    "intro": "Rhynchospora testui var. pleiantha, commonly known as the narrow-leaved spikerush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flower spikes that bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist soils. It plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
