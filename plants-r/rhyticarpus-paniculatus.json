    "intro": "Rhyticarpus paniculatus, commonly known as the beach hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Australia. It is a shrub that typically grows in sandy or saline soils, adapting well to harsh coastal environments. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Rhyticarpus paniculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing coastal dunes."
