It is characterized by its distinctive purple-tinged leaves and thorny stems, which are typical features of many Rubus species. The plant is native to parts of Europe and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. The fruit, a red or black raspberry-like berry, is edible and often used in culinary applications."
