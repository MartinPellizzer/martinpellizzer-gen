    "intro": "Rhus scytophylla, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. Rhus scytophylla thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained soils and full sun. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate urban conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping and erosion control."
