    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. hyalacantha, commonly known as the Ghost Cactus, is a fascinating succulent native to South America. It features a compact, rounded shape with a thick, fleshy stem that can grow up to 10 inches in diameter. The plant produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to deep orange, often appearing in late spring. Its leaves are typically reduced to spines, giving it a distinctive, almost ghostly appearance. This variety is prized for its unique morphology and is well-suited for rock gardens and arid environments."
