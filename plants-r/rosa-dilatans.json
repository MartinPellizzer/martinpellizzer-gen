    "intro": "Rosa dilatans, commonly known as the trailing rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its long, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. Rosa dilatans is native to Europe and parts of Asia and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ability to form dense ground cover."
