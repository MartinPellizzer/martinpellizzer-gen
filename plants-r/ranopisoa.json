    "intro": "Ranopisoa, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. These plants are characterized by their large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence. Ranopisoa species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, where they thrive in warm, humid climates. They produce showy flowers that range from yellow to red, often with a prominent central disk. The genus includes several species, some of which are considered invasive in certain regions due to their rapid growth and competitive nature."
