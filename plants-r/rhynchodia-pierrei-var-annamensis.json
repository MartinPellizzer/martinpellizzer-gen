    "intro": "Rhynchodia pierrei var. annamensis, commonly known as the Annam rhynchodia, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the subtropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Gesneriaceae and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from pale pink to deep red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with glossy, elliptical leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for shade gardens and rockeries. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
