It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, juicy berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its hardy nature, it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil."
