    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. subnitidiformis, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a variant of the glaucous rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue to bluish-green foliage and flowers that range from pale pink to white. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its leaves are often covered in a waxy, powdery coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
