    "intro": "Ruellia biceps, commonly known as the two-stemmed ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the warm climates of the Americas. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, attracting various pollinators. Ruellia biceps thrives in well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread through runners make it both a desirable and sometimes invasive species in certain regions."
