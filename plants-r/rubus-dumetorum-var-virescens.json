    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. virescens, commonly known as green-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark green, almost black berries that are typically larger than those of the common blackberry. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are typically covered in stinging hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
