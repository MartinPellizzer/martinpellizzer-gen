    "intro": "Remijia asperula, commonly known as the roughleaf spurge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It typically grows in moist to wet habitats such as marshes, swamps, and along stream banks. The plant has alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in fine, rough hairs, giving it its common name. Its flowers are small, yellow, and clustered in dense, spherical heads, which are borne on slender stalks. Remijia asperula is characterized by its milky sap, which is toxic and can cause skin irritation."
