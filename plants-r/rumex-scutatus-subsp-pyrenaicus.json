    "intro": "Rumex scutatus subsp. pyrenaicus, commonly known as the Pyrenean dock, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of the Iberian Peninsula and southern France. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features basal leaves that are lanceolate and covered in fine hairs, with a rough, reddish underside. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in dense clusters, and it produces elongated, ribbed seed capsules. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and distinctive foliage."
