It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its opposite, hairy, and often lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, round seeds. Randia pilosa is often found in moist, shaded areas and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
