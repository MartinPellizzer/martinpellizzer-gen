    "intro": "Rhopalobrachium fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant leaf orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its flowers bloom in clusters and emit a sweet, floral scent, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
