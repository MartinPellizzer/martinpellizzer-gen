    "intro": "Rhododendron pholidotum, commonly known as the Himalayan rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in Nepal, Bhutan, and India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in humid, cool climates. The plant features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round foliage. Rhododendron pholidotum is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific conditions to thrive."
