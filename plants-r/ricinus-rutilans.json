    "intro": "Ricinus rutilans, commonly known as the golden castor bean, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and striking yellow-orange flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces toxic seeds containing ricin, a potent toxin, which makes it dangerous to handle. It thrives in warm, sunny climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Despite its beauty, it requires caution due to its harmful properties."
