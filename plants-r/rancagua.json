It is one of the tallest bromeliads, with some specimens reaching heights of up to 10 meters. The plant features a massive rosette of sword-shaped leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. Its inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of bright red flowers that bloom once in its lifetime. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered an endangered species."
