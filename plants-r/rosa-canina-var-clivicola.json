    "intro": "Rosa canina var. clivicola, commonly known as the cliff rose, is a variant of the dog rose that thrives in rocky and coastal environments. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, which help it anchor itself in challenging terrain. The plant produces small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used historically in herbal medicine. Its adaptability to harsh conditions makes it a hardy and resilient species found in coastal cliffs and mountainous regions."
