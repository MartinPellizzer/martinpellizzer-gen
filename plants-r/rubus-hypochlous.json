    "intro": "Rubus hypochlous, commonly known as the greenleaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, red berries in the summer. Its leaves are typically green and have a distinctive, slightly hairy texture. Rubus hypochlous is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, where it thrives in partial shade."
