    "intro": "Rosa montana f. punctillata, commonly known as the Sierra Rosa or Sierra Blanca rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of California and Nevada. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, often with a distinctive white-pink speckled pattern on the petals. The plant produces rose hips that are typically red or orange, containing the seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its hardiness and ability to bloom throughout the growing season."
