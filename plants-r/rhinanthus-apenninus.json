    "intro": "Rhinanthus apenninus, commonly known as the Italian or Apennine blazingstar, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its bright yellow-orange flowers. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky areas. Rhinanthus apenninus blooms from June to August and is often found in the Mediterranean region."
