    "intro": "Reseda alba subsp. maritima, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive blue or violet flowers and silver-gray leaves covered in fine hairs. The plant thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. Its narrow, upright stems support clusters of small, showy flowers that bloom in summer. Reseda alba subsp. maritima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize coastal soils."
