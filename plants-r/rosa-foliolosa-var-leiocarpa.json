    "intro": "Rosa foliolosa var. leiocarpa, commonly known as the silky leaf rose, is a shrub-like species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its finely divided, almost fern-like leaves that give it a delicate, lacey appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring and early summer. Its stems are covered in soft, silvery hairs, contributing to its common name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage and modest floral display."
