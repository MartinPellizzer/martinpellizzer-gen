    "intro": "Ranunculus parviflorus var. australis, commonly known as the New Zealand buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to New Zealand. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with a central brownish disc, typically blooming in spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are finely divided and covered in a soft, hairy texture. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and forest margins. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is also considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
