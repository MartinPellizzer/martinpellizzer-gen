It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences, while the fruit is a aggregate of small, juicy drupelets. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. It plays an important ecological role by providing food for native birds and insects."
