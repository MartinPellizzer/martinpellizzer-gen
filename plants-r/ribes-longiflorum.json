    "intro": "Ribes longiflorum, commonly known as the long-flowered gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It belongs to the genus Ribes, which includes various species of flowering plants commonly found in the Americas. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit, with slender stems and alternate, ovate leaves that are often hairy beneath. Its most distinctive feature is its clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring, typically in shades of white or pale yellow. The plant produces small, tart berries that mature to a dark red or black color, often used in culinary applications despite their sharp flavor."
