    "intro": "Rhododendron deciduum, commonly known as the deciduous rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its deciduous leaves, which turn yellow before falling off in autumn. The plant produces clusters of pink to purple flowers in the spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. Its foliage is typically dark green and glossy, providing visual contrast to the flowers. Rhododendron deciduum thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in temperate forest environments."
