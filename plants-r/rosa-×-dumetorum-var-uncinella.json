    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. uncinella, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features slender, arching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with a finely serrated margin. This variety is well-suited for ground cover in gardens and is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to suppress weeds."
