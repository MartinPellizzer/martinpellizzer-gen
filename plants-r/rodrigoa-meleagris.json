    "intro": "Rodrigoa meleagris, commonly known as the Mexican beautyberry, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, characterized by its lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant produces fragrant white flowers in late spring, which are followed by the showy, berry-like fruits that persist through the winter. Rodrigoa meleagris thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening in tropical and subtropical regions. Its unique appearance and seasonal color contrast make it a notable species in botanical collections."
