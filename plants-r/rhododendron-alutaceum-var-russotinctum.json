    "intro": "Rhododendron alutaceum var. russotinctum, commonly known as the Russian redleaf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Russia. It features dense, leathery foliage that turns a striking reddish-brown in the autumn, adding seasonal visual interest. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pinkish-white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its vibrant fall color and delicate floral display."
