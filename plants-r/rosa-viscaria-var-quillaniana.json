It features dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for rock gardens or as a border plant due to its hardy nature and ornamental value. The variety is noted for its resilience in poor soil conditions and its ability to thrive in full sun."
