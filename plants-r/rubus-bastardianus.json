    "intro": "Rubus bastardianus, commonly known as the bastard blackberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy conditions. The leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows."
