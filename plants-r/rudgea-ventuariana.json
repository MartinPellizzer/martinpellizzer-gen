    "intro": "Rudgea ventuariana, commonly known as the Brazilian peacock flower, is a striking plant native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its large, showy, violet-blue flowers that resemble peacock feathers. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub, reaching heights of up to 3 meters, with lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. Its flowers bloom in clusters, often in spring and summer, attracting various pollinators such as birds and insects. Due to habitat loss, Rudgea ventuariana is considered vulnerable and is a subject of conservation efforts in its native range."
