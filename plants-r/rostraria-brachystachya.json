    "intro": "Rostraria brachystachya, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed rostraria, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It belongs to the family Restionaceae, which includes many grass-like plants adapted to coastal and saline environments. The plant produces small, clustered inflorescences that are often surrounded by modified leaves called bracts. Its unique floral structure features a narrow, tubular corolla with prominent stamens, typical of the genus Rostraria. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal dunes and marshy areas."
