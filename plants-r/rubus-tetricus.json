    "intro": "Rubus tetricus, commonly known as the shrubby blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to parts of Asia and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are not as widely cultivated as other blackberry varieties. Rubus tetricus thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a notable species for both ecological and horticultural study."
