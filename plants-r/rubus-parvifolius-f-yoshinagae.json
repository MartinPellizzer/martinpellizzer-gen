    "intro": "Rubus parvifolius f. yoshinagae, commonly known as the Yoshinaga's bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its distinctive foliage and floral features. It is a shrub native to Japan, typically found in forested areas and rocky slopes. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are generally smaller and more lobed compared to the typical Rubus parvifolius. This form is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
