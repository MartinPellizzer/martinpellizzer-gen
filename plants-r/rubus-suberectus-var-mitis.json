It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has thin, ascending stems covered in fine hairs, which contribute to its distinctive appearance. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and they have a slightly serrated edge. The flowers are white and clustered in groups of three, typical of the Rubus genus."
