    "intro": "Rubus thuringensis, commonly known as the Thuringian bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Central Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white to pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when mature. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
