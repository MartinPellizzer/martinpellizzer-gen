    "intro": "Ranunculus gmelinii f. prolificus, commonly known as the prolific buttercup, is a botanical variant of the buttercup family (Ranunculaceae). It is characterized by its bright yellow, spurred petals and its tendency to produce a large number of flowers, hence the name \"prolificus.\" This form is native to regions of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with trifoliate leaves and a short, hairy stem. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant floral display."
