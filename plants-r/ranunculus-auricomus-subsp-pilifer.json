    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pilifer, commonly known as the hairyleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features showy yellow flowers with broadly ovate, often hairy sepals that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, riverbanks, and woodland edges. Its foliage is characterized by deeply lobed leaves with a hairy texture, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that disperse via wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
