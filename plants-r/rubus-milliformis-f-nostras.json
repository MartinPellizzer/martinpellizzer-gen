    "intro": "Rubus milliformis f. nostras, commonly known as the coastal blackberry, is a unique variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. This subspecies is characterized by its compact growth habit and dark, almost black, berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically oval-shaped with a slightly serrated edge, and the plant thrives in coastal environments with high salinity and wind exposure. It has a woody stem structure and produces small, white flowers in the spring. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in challenging coastal conditions."
