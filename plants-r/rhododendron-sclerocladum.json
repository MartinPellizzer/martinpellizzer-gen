    "intro": "Rhododendron sclerocladum, commonly known as the dense-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a suitable ornamental plant in woodland gardens. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in high-altitude forests."
