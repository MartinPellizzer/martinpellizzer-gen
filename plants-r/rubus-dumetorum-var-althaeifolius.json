    "intro": "Rubus dumetorum var. althaeifolius, commonly known as the althaeifolius raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, often thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that resemble those of the althaea plant, giving it its common name. The flowers are typically pink or white, with five petals and numerous stamens, and they appear in clusters. The fruit, a red or black aggregate berry, is edible but often has a tart flavor. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
