It is characterized by its aromatic, reddish-barked trunk and needle-like leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous cones that contain seeds dispersed by wind. Its foliage provides habitat for various wildlife species, and its wood is highly valued for its durability and resistance to decay. The tree plays an important ecological role in forest ecosystems, contributing to soil stability and biodiversity."
