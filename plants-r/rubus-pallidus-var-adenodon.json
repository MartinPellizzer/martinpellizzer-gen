It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow to reddish flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, hairy berries in the summer. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
