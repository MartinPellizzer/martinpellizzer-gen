    "intro": "Ranunculus alboffii, commonly known as the alboff's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, palmately divided yellow flowers with a distinctive red or purple central blotch. The plant has slender, hairy stems that often lie prostrate or ascending, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a waxy coating. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
