    "intro": "Rhodosepala, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a species of orchid native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its striking golden-yellow flowers that resemble small bells, hence its common name. The plant typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions, preferring moist, shaded environments. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often have a waxy texture, which helps in retaining moisture. Rhodosepala is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its unique floral display."
