    "intro": "Rumex viridis, commonly known as green sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and western Asia. It features upright, branching stems covered in small, serrated leaves that are typically bright green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in dense clusters during the spring and early summer. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, though they are sometimes used in cooking in moderation. Rumex viridis is often found in moist soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
