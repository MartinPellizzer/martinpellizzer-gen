    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. puripulvis, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers partial shade. Its botanical features make it distinct from other Rubus species, particularly in its leaf and fruit characteristics."
