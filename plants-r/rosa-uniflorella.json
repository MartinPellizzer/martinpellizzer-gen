    "intro": "Rosa uniflorella, commonly known as the single-flower rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its small, solitary flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white, often with a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, preferring well-drained soil and partial sunlight. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa uniflorella is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
