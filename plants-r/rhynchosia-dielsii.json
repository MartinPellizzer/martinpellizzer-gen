    "intro": "Rhynchosia dielsii, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers that are typically clustered in racemes. The plant produces flat, bean-like pods that contain several seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of protein. Rhynchosia dielsii thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and forest edges. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it valuable for soil enrichment in agricultural settings."
