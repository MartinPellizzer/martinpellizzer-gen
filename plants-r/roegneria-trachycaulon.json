    "intro": "Roegneria trachycaulon, commonly known as the rough-stemmed wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, tufted foliage with narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Its leaves are often covered in a fine layer of hair, giving them a rough texture. Roegneria trachycaulon is adapted to dry, rocky environments and is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
