    "intro": "Rauvolfia oppositifolia, commonly known as the Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender pedicels. Its root system is notable for containing alkaloids, which have been studied for potential medicinal properties. Rauvolfia oppositifolia is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
