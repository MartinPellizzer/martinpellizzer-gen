    "intro": "Rubus hystrix var. rosaceiformis, commonly known as the rose-like bramble, is a variant of the prickly rose species native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and compound leaves that resemble those of roses. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and ecological role, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
