    "intro": "Rhabdadenia macrostoma var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy stem cactus, is a succulent plant native to South America. It is characterized by its cylindrical, branching stems that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the warmer months, typically in spring or early summer. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its unique morphology and adaptability, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in cactus collections."
