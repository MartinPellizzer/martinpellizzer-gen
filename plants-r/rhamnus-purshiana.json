    "intro": "Rhamnus purshiana, commonly known as the cascara tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits that turn reddish-brown when mature. Its bark is thick, rough, and fissured, often peeling in thin, papery layers. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, with the dried inner bark being used in traditional herbal medicine."
