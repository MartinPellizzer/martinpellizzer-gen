    "intro": "Rhynchospora velutina var. pohlii, commonly known as the velvet sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered spikes of pale green to reddish flowers, which are often subtended by bracts. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its ecological importance, it plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
