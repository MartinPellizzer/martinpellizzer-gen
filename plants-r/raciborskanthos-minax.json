    "intro": "Raciborskanthos minax, commonly known as the rare Himalayan orchid, is a flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and requires a cool, moist environment to thrive. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, while its roots are fibrous and adapted to nutrient-poor substrates. Due to habitat loss and over-collection, Raciborskanthos minax is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
