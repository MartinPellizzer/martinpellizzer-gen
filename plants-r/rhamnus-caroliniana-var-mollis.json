    "intro": "Rhamnus caroliniana var. mollis, commonly known as the softleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features smooth, grayish-brown bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by dark blue, glossy berries in the fall. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a soft, velvety texture that distinguishes it from other varieties of buckthorn. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
