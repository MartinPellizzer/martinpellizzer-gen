    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis crataegoides, commonly known as the Chinese hawthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to China. It features small, oval leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy on the underside. The plant produces clusters of white flowers in the spring, followed by small, red berries that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a suitable choice for garden landscapes. Its compact growth habit and seasonal color changes make it a popular ornamental plant in temperate regions."
