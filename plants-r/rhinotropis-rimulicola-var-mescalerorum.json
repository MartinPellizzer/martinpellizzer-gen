    "intro": "Rhinotropis rimulicola var. mescalerorum, commonly known as the Mescaler\u00f3 Desert Evening Primrose, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States. It is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in the evening, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. The plant has hairy, linear leaves and produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. It is adapted to thrive in sandy or rocky soils with minimal water availability. Its botanical features reflect its evolutionary response to the harsh desert environment."
