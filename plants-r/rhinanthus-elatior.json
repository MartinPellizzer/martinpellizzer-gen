    "intro": "Rhinanthus elatior, commonly known as the greater yellowrocket, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils, such as roadsides and wastelands, and can reach heights of up to 1 meter. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Rhinanthus elatior plays a role in supporting pollinators, particularly bees, due to its nectar-rich flowers."
