It is characterized by its dense, dark foliage and compact growth habit, which allows it to thrive in shaded environments. The plant produces small, usually red or black berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. It is often found in woodland areas and underbrush where light is limited. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and adaptability to low-light conditions."
