    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. confinis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. This subspecies is notable for its ecological role in supporting pollinators in its native habitats."
