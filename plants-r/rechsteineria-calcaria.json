    "intro": "Rechsteineria calcaria, commonly known as the rock lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features linear, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish powder, known as a bloom. The plant produces small, white or pale blue flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
