    "intro": "Rubus corbierei, commonly known as the Corsican bramble, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region, particularly Corsica and Sardinia. It belongs to the Rubus genus within the Rosaceae family, which includes many other brambles and berries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in sunny, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species in its native habitat."
