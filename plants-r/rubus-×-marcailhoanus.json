    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 marcailhoanus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry-loganberry. This plant is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus loganobaccus (loganberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits from both parents. It is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces large, sweet-tart berries that are often cultivated for their flavor and culinary use. Its botanical significance lies in its role as an example of natural hybridization in the Rubus family."
