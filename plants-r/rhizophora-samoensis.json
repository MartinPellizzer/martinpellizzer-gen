    "intro": "Rhizophora samoensis, commonly known as the Samoan mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the tropical Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its extensive root system, which includes prop roots that help stabilize the tree in waterlogged soils. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by the development of woody, elongated fruits. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating to reduce water loss. This species plays a vital role in coastal ecosystems by preventing erosion and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial organisms."
