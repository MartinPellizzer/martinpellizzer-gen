    "intro": "Rubus conoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often described as having a tart flavor. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges and a hairy texture, contributing to its botanical distinctiveness. Rubus conoides thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests."
