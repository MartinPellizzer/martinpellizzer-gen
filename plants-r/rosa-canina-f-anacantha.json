    "intro": "Rosa canina f. anacantha, commonly known as the thorny dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its dense, thorned stems and clusters of small, pale pink flowers. The plant produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is typically found in woodland edges and scrub habitats across Europe. This form is notable for its increased thorn density compared to the typical Rosa canina."
