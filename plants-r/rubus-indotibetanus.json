    "intro": "Rubus indotibetanus, commonly known as the Tibetan raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas and neighboring regions. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. It is adapted to cold climates and can thrive in poor soil conditions. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
