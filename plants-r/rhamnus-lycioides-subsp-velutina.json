It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, orange berries that are edible but have a strong, bitter taste. It thrives in rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The species is notable for its adaptability to arid environments and its role in supporting local wildlife."
