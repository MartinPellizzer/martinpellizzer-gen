    "intro": "Rubus argenteus var. castrolinensis, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is often cultivated in gardens and small-scale farms."
