    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. nana, commonly known as the dwarf hairy rose, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features soft, fuzzy stems and broad, lobed leaves that are covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, moist soil. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and hardiness in cooler climates."
