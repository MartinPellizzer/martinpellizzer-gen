    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. syrmiensis, commonly known as the Syrmian meadow rose, is a perennial shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant typically grows in open grasslands, meadows, and along roadsides, preferring well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and it produces rose hips that are edible but have a tart flavor. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
