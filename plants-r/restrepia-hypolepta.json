    "intro": "Restrepia hypolepta, commonly known as the slender lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its unique, pouch-like floral structure that resembles a slipper. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks or branches in its natural habitat. Its flowers are usually pale green or yellowish, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Restrepia hypolepta is considered a threatened species in its native range."
