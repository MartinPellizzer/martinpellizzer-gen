    "intro": "Roscoea purpurea f. rubra, commonly known as the purple rhubarb or red-leaf roscoea, is a striking ornamental plant native to the Himalayas. It is a rhizomatous perennial that produces large, showy, violet-pink bracts that enclose its small, yellow flowers. The foliage is characterized by its dark green, arrow-shaped leaves with a reddish tinge, especially in cooler weather. It thrives in partial shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. This cultivar is prized for its unique appearance and ability to add color to shaded landscapes."
