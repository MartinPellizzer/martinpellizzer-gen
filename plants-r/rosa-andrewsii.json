    "intro": "Rosa andrewsii, commonly known as the Andrews' rose, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the southwestern United States, particularly Arizona and New Mexico, where it thrives in arid and semi-arid environments. The plant is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and fragrant pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces small, red berries that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Rosa andrewsii is adapted to dry conditions and is often found in rocky soils and along canyon walls."
