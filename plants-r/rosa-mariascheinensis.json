    "intro": "Rosa mariascheinensis, commonly known as the Maria Schein rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate pink flowers and fragrant aroma, which are typical features of many rose species. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellowish-orange flowers in late summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, conservation efforts are underway to protect this unique botanical specimen."
