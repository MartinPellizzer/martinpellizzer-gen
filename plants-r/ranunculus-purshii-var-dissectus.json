    "intro": "Ranunculus purshii var. dissectus, commonly known as the dissected buttercup, is a member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, palmately divided leaves and showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens. Native to the western United States, this plant thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its foliage is often finely dissected, giving it a lacy appearance. The plant produces achenes as its fruit, which are dispersed by wind, contributing to its natural distribution."
