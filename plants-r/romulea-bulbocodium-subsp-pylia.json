    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. pylia, commonly known as the Pyrenean romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pale yellow to orange. The plant produces small, rounded bulbs that serve as storage organs and are essential for its survival in harsh alpine conditions. It typically blooms in spring and thrives in well-drained, rocky soils at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
