    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. bessoniana, commonly known as the Bessoniana false acacia, is a variant of the honeylocust tree native to the Balkan Peninsula. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are typically smaller and more finely divided than those of the typical Robinia pseudoacacia. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in upright clusters, which bloom in early summer. Its fruits are elongated pods that split open to release seeds with tufts of silky hair, aiding in wind dispersal. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil conditions."
