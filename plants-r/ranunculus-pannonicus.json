    "intro": "Ranunculus pannonicus, commonly known as the Pannonian buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Central and Eastern Europe. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and can be found in meadows, pastures, and along riverbanks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces smooth, green, oval-shaped fruits. Ranunculus pannonicus is often considered a wildflower with ornamental value but can be toxic if ingested."
