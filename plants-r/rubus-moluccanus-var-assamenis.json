    "intro": "Rubus moluccanus var. assamenis, commonly known as the Assam blackberry, is a variant of the moluccan raspberry native to the eastern Himalayas and northeastern India. This shrub typically grows in moist, temperate forests and thrives in partially shaded environments. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are dark purple to black when mature. The berries are edible, though often tart, and are used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
