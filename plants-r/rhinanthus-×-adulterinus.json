    "intro": "Rhinanthus \u00d7 adulterinus, commonly known as the hybrid common toadflax, is a sterile hybrid resulting from the cross between Rhinanthus minor and Rhinanthus glabellus. It is a herbaceous annual plant with yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in disturbed soils and open habitats, such as roadsides and meadows. Its leaves are lanceolate and slightly hairy, while its stems are erect and branching. Due to its sterility, it does not produce seeds and relies on vegetative propagation or the presence of its parent species for survival."
