    "intro": "Rosa rhynchocarpa, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide protection against herbivores and harsh environmental conditions. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and covered in a fine layer of soft, white hairs. Rosa rhynchocarpa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and resilience."
