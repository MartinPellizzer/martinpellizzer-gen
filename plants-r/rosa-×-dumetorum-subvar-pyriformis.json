    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. pyriformis, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a hybrid shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically in clusters. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are elliptical and slightly serrated. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping for its ability to cover ground and prevent erosion."
