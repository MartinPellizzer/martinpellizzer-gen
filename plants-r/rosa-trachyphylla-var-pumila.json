    "intro": "Rosa trachyphylla var. pumila, commonly known as the dwarf rugosa rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It features small, thornless stems and is characterized by its dense, rounded growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and covered with fine, fuzzy hairs. This variety is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardiness and ornamental appeal."
