    "intro": "Rosa omissa var. misniensis, commonly known as the Misniensis rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of northern Vietnam. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that range in color from pale pink to white, often with a subtle red hue at the base of the petals. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, preferring well-drained, acidic soils. Its foliage consists of dark green, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern and is rarely cultivated outside its native range."
