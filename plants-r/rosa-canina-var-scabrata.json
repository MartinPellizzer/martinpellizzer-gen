    "intro": "Rosa canina var. scabrata, commonly known as the bristly dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its rough, bristly stems and dark red to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. This plant is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils. Its fruit, a red, hairy rosehip, is rich in vitamin C and has been historically used in herbal medicine."
