    "intro": "Ranunculus mosellanus, commonly known as the noble buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to seven petals, typically in shades of yellow, orange, or red. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, serrated leaves and produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that bloom in spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a popular choice for garden cultivation and ecological restoration projects."
