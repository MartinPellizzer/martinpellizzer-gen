    "intro": "Rourea nivea, commonly known as the white rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking white to pale pink flowers that bloom in clusters, adding a dramatic visual appeal to its appearance. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are opposite, simple, and often have a waxy texture, which helps in reducing water loss in its native habitat. Rourea nivea is valued in horticulture for its ornamental value and is often cultivated in warm, humid climates."
