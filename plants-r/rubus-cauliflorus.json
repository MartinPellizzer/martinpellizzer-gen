    "intro": "Rubus cauliflorus, commonly known as the cauliflower raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia and Africa. It is characterized by its woody stems and clusters of small, white or pink flowers that bloom throughout the growing season. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in appearance to raspberries but have a milder flavor. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. Rubus cauliflorus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks."
