    "intro": "Rhus cotinus pendula, commonly known as the smoke bush or weeping smoke tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its distinctive, feathery, pale pink to white inflorescences that resemble clouds or smoke, appearing in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits in the fall. Its leaves are oval to elliptical, with a slightly serrated margin, and turn vibrant shades of red and orange in autumn. Rhus cotinus pendula is often cultivated for its ornamental value and adaptability to various soil types."
