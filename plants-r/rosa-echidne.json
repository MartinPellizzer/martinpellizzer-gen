    "intro": "Rosa echidne, commonly known as the ghostly rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and clusters of pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant's leaves are alternate, simple, and have a slightly serrated edge, while its fragrant flowers emit a subtle aroma. Rosa echidne is adapted to high altitudes and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
