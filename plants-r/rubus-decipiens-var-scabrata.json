    "intro": "Rubus decipiens var. scabrata, commonly known as the rough-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its rough, hairy stems and foliage. It is native to parts of North America, particularly in the eastern United States, where it thrives in woodland and disturbed habitats. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically tart and less sweet than common blackberries. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The species is valued for its hardiness and adaptability, making it a common sight in naturalized areas."
