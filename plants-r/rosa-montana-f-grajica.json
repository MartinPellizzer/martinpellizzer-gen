It features dark green, leathery foliage and produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is well-suited for rock gardens or as a container plant due to its compact size and hardy nature. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and ease of cultivation in temperate climates."
