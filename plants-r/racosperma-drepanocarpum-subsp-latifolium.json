    "intro": "Racosperma drepanocarpum subsp. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leafed wattle, is a shrub native to southeastern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically broad and serrated, and its yellow floral spikes that bloom in spring. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds, typical of the Fabaceae family. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and heathlands. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
