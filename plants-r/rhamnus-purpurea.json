    "intro": "Rhamnus purpurea, commonly known as red buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features alternate, simple, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually red or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark purple berries in the fall. Its root system is fibrous, and it is often found in disturbed soils, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Rhamnus purpurea is known for its ornamental value and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
