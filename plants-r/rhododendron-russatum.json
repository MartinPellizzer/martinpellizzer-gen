    "intro": "Rhododendron russatum, commonly known as the Russian rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its flowers are often accompanied by showy bracts, which can be larger than the actual petals. Rhododendron russatum thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes."
