    "intro": "Rathbunia alamosensis, commonly known as the Alamos sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States. It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, adapted to reduce water loss in arid environments. Rathbunia alamosensis is an important species for pollinators and is often found in desert and scrubland habitats."
