It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring thorny stems and pinnate leaves. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red hip fruits. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Rosa canina is native to Europe and western Asia and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and scrublands."
