    "intro": "Restrepia flosculata f. picta, commonly known as the painted bromeliad, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the cloud forests of Costa Rica. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful bracts that resemble flowers, though they are actually modified leaves. The plant features a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves that collect rainwater, providing a habitat for small organisms. Its unique appearance makes it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes. The varietal form 'picta' is distinguished by its vivid, often contrasting color patterns on the bracts."
