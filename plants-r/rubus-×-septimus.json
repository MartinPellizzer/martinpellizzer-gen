This species exhibits characteristics of both parent plants, featuring thorny stems and aggregate fruits. The flowers are typically pink or white, and the plant thrives in temperate climates. It is valued for its edible fruits, which have a flavor profile that combines the tartness of raspberries with the richness of blackberries."
