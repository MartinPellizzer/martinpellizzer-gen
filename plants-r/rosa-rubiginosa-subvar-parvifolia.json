    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa subvar. parvifolia, commonly known as the dwarf rose or the shrub rose, is a compact, thorny shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in spring and summer. The leaves are narrow and trifoliate, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its fragrant flowers attract pollinators like bees and butterflies, contributing to its ecological value. This subspecies is well-suited for rock gardens and dry landscapes due to its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements."
