    "intro": "Ranunculus kochii, commonly known as the Koch's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, serrated leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, white hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Ranunculus kochii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
