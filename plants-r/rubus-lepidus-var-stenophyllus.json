    "intro": "Rubus lepidus var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves with a leathery texture. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
