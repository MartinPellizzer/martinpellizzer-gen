    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. obtegens, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the temperate regions of Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broad, kidney-shaped petals that are often reflexed at the edges. The plant has a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves that are divided into lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies obtegens is characterized by its more robust growth and broader leaf structure compared to other forms of Ranunculus auricomus."
