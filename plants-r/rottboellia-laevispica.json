    "intro": "Rottboellia laevispica, commonly known as the smoothleaf rottbollias, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, cylindrical stems that are often hairy, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that have a smooth texture. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically pale green to brown in color. Its fibrous roots make it adaptable to various soil types, and it thrives in warm, humid climates. Rottboellia laevispica is often found in open areas, disturbed soils, and along roadsides."
