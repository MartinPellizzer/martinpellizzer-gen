    "intro": "Roydsia philippinensis, commonly known as the Philippine sandalwood, is a small evergreen tree native to the Philippines. It belongs to the family Lauraceae and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood and glossy, elliptical leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by small, spherical fruits containing a single seed. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in lowland to montane forests. Due to overharvesting, it is considered a vulnerable species in its natural habitat."
