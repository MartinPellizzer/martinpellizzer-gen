    "intro": "Restrepia shuttleworthii, commonly known as the Shuttleworth's restrepia, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, pseudobulbous growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves. The plant produces intricate, fragrant flowers in shades of white and pale yellow, typically during the cooler months. It thrives in cool, humid environments with high air circulation and is often found growing on rock faces or in shaded forest areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
