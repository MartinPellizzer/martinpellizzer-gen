    "intro": "Rafflesia magnifica, commonly known as the giant Rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach diameters of up to 1 meter. The plant lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss, Rafflesia magnifica is considered vulnerable, with its survival dependent on the preservation of its specific ecological environment."
