    "intro": "Ranunculus bujbensis, commonly known as the Bujb's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant features a basal rosette of finely divided, bright green leaves, and produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
