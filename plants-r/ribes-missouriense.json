    "intro": "Ribes missouriense, commonly known as Missouri gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the central and eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and is characterized by its oval, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible when ripe. These berries are rich in vitamin C and are often used in jams and jellies. The shrub thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
