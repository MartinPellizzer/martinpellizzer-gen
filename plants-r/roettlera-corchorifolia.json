    "intro": "Roettlera corchorifolia, commonly known as the false nettle, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are often borne on slender pedicels. Its leaves are usually hairy, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Roettlera corchorifolia is often mistaken for true nettles due to its similar appearance."
