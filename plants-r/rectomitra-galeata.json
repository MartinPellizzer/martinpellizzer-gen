    "intro": "Rectomitra galeata, commonly known as the Galeata orchid, is a species of orchid native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its delicate, often fragrant flowers that come in a variety of colors, including white, pink, and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees in humid forest environments. Its leaves are usually elongated and covered in a fine, waxy coating, which helps retain moisture. The orchid's unique floral structure and growth habits make it a notable subject in botanical studies and horticulture."
