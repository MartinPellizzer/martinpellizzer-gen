It consists of several species, most of which are small, herbaceous plants that thrive in rocky or arid environments. The plants typically have basal leaves and produce small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Reichardia species are characterized by their capsule fruits and are often found in temperate regions. They are valued for their ornamental appeal and ecological role in stabilizing soil in harsh conditions."
