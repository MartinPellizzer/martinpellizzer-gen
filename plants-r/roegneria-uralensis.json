    "intro": "Roegneria uralensis, commonly known as the Siberian wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to the cold climates of Eurasia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically green to bluish-green in color. The plant produces dense clusters of spikelets, which are its flowering structures, often appearing in late spring to early summer. It is adapted to harsh environments, thriving in well-drained soils and tolerating low temperatures. Roegneria uralensis is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in challenging conditions."
