    "intro": "Rhodospatha herrerae, commonly known as the Herrera's orchid, is a rare and endangered species native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy flowers that typically bloom in vibrant shades of pink and white. The plant has a pseudobulb structure, which helps it store water and nutrients, adapting to its often dry or seasonal habitats. Its leaves are usually broad and lance-shaped, providing efficient photosynthesis in low-light conditions. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
