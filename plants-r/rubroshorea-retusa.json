    "intro": "Rubroshorea retusa, commonly known as the red-stemmed evergreen, is a tropical plant characterized by its distinctive reddish-brown stems and lance-shaped leaves. It is native to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, where it thrives in humid, shaded environments. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by ornamental red fruits containing seeds. Its leaves are glossy and have a leathery texture, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Due to its slow growth and specific care requirements, it is often cultivated in greenhouses or as a houseplant."
