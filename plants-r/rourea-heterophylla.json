    "intro": "Rourea heterophylla, commonly known as the variable-leaf rourea, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its unique leaves that vary in shape and size depending on the environmental conditions. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on plant adaptation and morphological variation."
