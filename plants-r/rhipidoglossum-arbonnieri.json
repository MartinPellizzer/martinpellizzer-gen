    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum arbonnieri, commonly known as the Florida panther lichen, is a foliose lichen that thrives in humid, shaded environments. It is characterized by its bright green to yellowish-green thallus, which often features distinct lobes and a finely granular texture. The lichen forms a symbiotic relationship with a specific species of cyanobacteria, which contributes to its nutrient acquisition. It is typically found on decaying wood in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in the southeastern United States. Due to its specialized habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of ecosystem health."
