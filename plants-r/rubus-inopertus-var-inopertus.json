It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited range, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
