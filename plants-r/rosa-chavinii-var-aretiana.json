    "intro": "Rosa chavinii var. aretiana, commonly known as the Arequipa rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the high-altitude regions of Peru. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is adapted to the cold, dry climate of the Andean mountains, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. Its leaves are typically dark green and slightly hairy, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blooms. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a symbol of Peruvian biodiversity."
