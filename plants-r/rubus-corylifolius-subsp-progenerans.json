    "intro": "Rubus corylifolius subsp. progenerans, commonly known as the Chinese blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate or pinnate, and its aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, followed by edible, sweet-tart berries in the summer. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit. The subspecies is distinguished by its more robust growth and larger fruit size compared to other Rubus species."
