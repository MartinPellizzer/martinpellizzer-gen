    "intro": "Ranunculus miser, commonly known as the weedy buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant typically grows in moist, disturbed soils and can be found in meadows, along roadsides, and in woodland edges. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. Ranunculus miser is known for its ability to thrive in a variety of environmental conditions, making it a common sight in temperate regions."
