    "intro": "Rhytidophyllum grande, commonly known as the giant barkless cycad, is a unique plant native to the island of Socotra. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can grow up to 3 meters in length. The plant lacks a trunk and has a dense, woody root system that anchors it in the rocky soil. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are typically hidden within its leaf axils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
