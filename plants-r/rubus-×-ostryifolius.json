    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 ostryifolius, commonly known as the blackberry-elderberry hybrid, is a deciduous shrub that exhibits characteristics of both its parent species. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features thorny stems with alternate, compound leaves composed of 5\u20137 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color, with a sweet to tart flavor.
