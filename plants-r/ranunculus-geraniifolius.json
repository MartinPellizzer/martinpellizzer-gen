    "intro": "Ranunculus geraniifolius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It has a rhizomatous root system that allows it to spread and form dense colonies. Its botanical name reflects its leaf structure, with \"geraniifolius\" referring to its resemblance to geranium leaves."
