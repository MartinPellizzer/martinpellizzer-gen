This hybrid plant is a result of crossbreeding between Rubus ursinus and Rubus hirtellus, combining traits from both parent species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and hardy nature."
