    "intro": "Robinia spectabilis, commonly known as the pink pondberry, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5 to 9 oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces showy, fragrant pink or white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release small, red, fleshy seeds. Robinia spectabilis is adapted to wet soils and is often found in swamps and along waterways."
