    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. leucocarpus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in early spring, which are followed by the distinctive white or pale berries. These berries are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species and have a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates."
