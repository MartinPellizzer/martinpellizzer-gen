    "intro": "Rhododendron asteium, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery foliage that provides a lush green backdrop for its showy, clustered flowers. The blooms, typically pink or red, appear in late spring and are borne on short pedicels. This plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to create a dense, low-maintenance garden feature."
