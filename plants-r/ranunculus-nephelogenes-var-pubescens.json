    "intro": "Ranunculus nephelogenes var. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent cloudland buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular leaves and showy yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
