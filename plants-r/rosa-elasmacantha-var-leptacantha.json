    "intro": "Rosa elasmacantha var. leptacantha, commonly known as the slender-stemmed roses, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has finely divided, pinnate leaves that are covered in soft, glandular hairs, contributing to its unique appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is typically found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
