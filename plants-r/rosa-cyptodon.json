    "intro": "Rosa cyptodon, commonly known as the cryptic rose, is a rare and less-studied species within the rose family. It is characterized by its small, delicate flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, soft hairs. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in some regions."
