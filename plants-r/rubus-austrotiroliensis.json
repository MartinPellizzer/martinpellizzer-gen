    "intro": "Rubus austrotiroliensis, commonly known as the Austro-Tirolean raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It belongs to the Rubus genus, which includes many species of shrubs commonly referred to as blackberries or raspberries. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in rocky and well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
