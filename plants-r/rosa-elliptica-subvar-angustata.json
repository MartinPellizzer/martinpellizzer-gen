It is characterized by its slender, elliptical leaves that are typically narrower than those of the typical form. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
