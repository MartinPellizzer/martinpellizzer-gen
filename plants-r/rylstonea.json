    "intro": "Rylstonea, commonly known as the golden mistflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the temperate regions of Australia. It features upright, slender stems covered in fine, silky hairs that give it a distinctive, almost ethereal appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped, alternate, and covered in a dense layer of fine pubescence. Rylstonea is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
