    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. incultus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of serrated, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they are not widely cultivated for consumption. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and traditional herbal practices."
