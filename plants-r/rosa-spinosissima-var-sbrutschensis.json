    "intro": "Rosa spinosissima var. sbrutschensis, commonly known as the Sbrutschensis rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that provide a lush backdrop to its showy blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and botanical interest."
