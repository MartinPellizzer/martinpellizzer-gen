    "intro": "Ranunculus diversifolius var. submersus, commonly known as the submerged water crowfoot, is a variant of the water crowfoot genus characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic habitat. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds, lakes, and streams. The plant features finely divided, floating or submerged leaves that are often arranged in a whorled pattern. Its flowers are usually small and yellow, with five petals, and are borne on slender, erect stems. This variant is notable for its adaptation to underwater conditions, with specialized structures that facilitate gas exchange and light absorption."
