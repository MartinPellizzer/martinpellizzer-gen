    "intro": "Rosa webbiana var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular shrub rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrub form and dark green, glossy foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are often covered with glandular dots, which secrete a sticky substance, giving it its scientific name. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and visual interest."
