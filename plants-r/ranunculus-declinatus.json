    "intro": "Ranunculus declinatus, commonly known as the bent-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and deeply lobed leaves that are often curled or folded. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodland edges, and streambanks. Its flowers bloom from late spring to early summer, and it is often found in shaded to partially shaded environments. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
