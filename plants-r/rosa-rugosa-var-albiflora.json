    "intro": "Rosa rugosa var. albiflora, commonly known as the white-flowered rugosa rose, is a deciduous shrub native to coastal regions of East Asia. It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces fragrant, white flowers in late summer, which are followed by orange-red hips that persist through winter. It is highly adaptable to salty air and poor soils, making it a hardy ornamental plant. Its botanical features make it popular in coastal gardens and for erosion control."
