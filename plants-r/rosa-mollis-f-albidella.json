    "intro": "Rosa mollis f. albidella, commonly known as the white-flowered form of the soft rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It features small, fragrant flowers that are pale white to almost pink in color, with five petals and a subtle, sweet aroma. The leaves are typically gray-green, covered in a fine, velvety down that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
