    "intro": "Rourea lescrauwaetii var. seretii, commonly known as the Seret's rourea, is a rare and lesser-known species native to specific regions of Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its dense, leathery leaves and distinctive floral structures. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a range of colors from white to pink. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
