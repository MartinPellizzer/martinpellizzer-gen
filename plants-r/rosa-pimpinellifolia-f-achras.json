    "intro": "Rosa pimpinellifolia f. achras, commonly known as the creeping rose or rock rose, is a horticultural form of the shrub rose. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with narrow, serrated leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained soils. This cultivar is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
