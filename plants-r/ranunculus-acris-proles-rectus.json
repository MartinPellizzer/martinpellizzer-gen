    "intro": "Ranunculus acris proles rectus, commonly known as the upright meadow buttercup, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow, saucer-shaped flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in meadows, grasslands, and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, elongated seed pods that release seeds by wind. The upright proles rectus variety is distinguished by its straight, non-branching stem, which supports its vibrant yellow blooms."
