    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. latifolius, commonly known as broadleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped, serrated leaves that are typically broad and dark green, often with a distinctive reddish or purple stem. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
