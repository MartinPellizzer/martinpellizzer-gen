    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis f. acutangulatus, commonly known as the sharp-angled bramble, is a variant of the bramble family with distinctive botanical features. It is characterized by its finely serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or hedgerow environments. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its native habitat, with a structure that supports both vegetative growth and reproductive success."
