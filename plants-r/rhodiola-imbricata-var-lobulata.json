    "intro": "Rhodiola imbricata var. lobulata, commonly known as the alpine rhodiola, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, cushion-like growth form and fleshy, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late summer. It thrives in cold, arid environments and is adapted to withstand extreme temperature fluctuations and low nutrient soils. This variant is valued for its medicinal properties and is often used in traditional herbal remedies."
