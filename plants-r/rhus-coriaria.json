    "intro": "Rhus coriaria, commonly known as the buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in pairs along the stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that mature in late summer. Its bark is thick and fissured, and the plant is known for its ability to thrive in poor, dry soils. Rhus coriaria has been historically used for its medicinal properties and as a source of dye."
