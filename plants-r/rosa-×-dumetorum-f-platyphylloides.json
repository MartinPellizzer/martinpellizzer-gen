    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock rose, is a horticultural form of a hybrid rose species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage that is broader and flatter than typical rose leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, often with a distinctive double or semi-double bloom. It is well-suited for rock gardens and borders due to its hardy nature and ability to thrive in well-drained soil.
