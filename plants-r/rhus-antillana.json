    "intro": "Rhus antillana, commonly known as the Brazilian sumac, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically pinnate with 9 to 15 leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some animals. Rhus antillana thrives in humid, tropical climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it an important species in ecological studies and traditional medicine."
