    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subglaucina, commonly known as the glaucous rose, is a variant of the dog rose characterized by its distinctive bluish-gray foliage. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and western Asia, typically growing to a height of 1\u20133 meters. The plant produces small, pale pink flowers in early summer, which are followed by red, fuzzy hips that contain seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins, and the stems are often armed with thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and floral display."
