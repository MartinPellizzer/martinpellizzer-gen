    "intro": "Rosa buxifolia, commonly known as the boxleaf rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, foliage that resembles the leaves of boxwood, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for use as a decorative hedge or in rock gardens. Rosa buxifolia is relatively low maintenance but requires well-drained soil and full sun to thrive."
