It belongs to the Rhamnaceae family and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in rocky or dry soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
