    "intro": "Rhododendron oleifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a shrub native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in coastal areas and is adapted to sandy or rocky soils. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, providing a striking visual contrast to its showy blossoms. Rhododendron oleifolium is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in coastal environments."
