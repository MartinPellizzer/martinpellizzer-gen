    "intro": "Ranunculus lundbyensis, commonly known as the Lundby's buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Scandinavia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, typically yellow or white flowers with numerous petals. The plant has palmate leaves divided into three to five lobes, which are often covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is typically found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
