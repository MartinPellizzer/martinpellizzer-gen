    "intro": "Rousseauxia marojejensis, commonly known as the Marojejy rousseauxia, is a rare and endemic plant species found exclusively in the Marojejy National Park in northeastern Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes a diverse group of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow in color. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, adapted to the humid and shaded conditions of its native habitat. Due to its restricted distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and deforestation."
