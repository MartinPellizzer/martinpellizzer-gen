    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. sibboensis, commonly known as the Sibbo's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, nodding yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically surrounded by a ring of small, green sepals. The plant has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
