    "intro": "Robinia frutescens, commonly known as the yellowwood or false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive yellowish-green color. The plant produces fragrant, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by flat, brown pods that contain several seeds. It is known for its strong, hard wood, which is resistant to decay, making it valuable for construction. The plant is also adapted to poor soils and is often found in dry, open habitats."
