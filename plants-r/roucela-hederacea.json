    "intro": "Roucela hederacea, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help suppress weeds. Roucela hederacea is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in native plant gardens."
