    "intro": "Rubus spinulosus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant is native to parts of North America, particularly the eastern and central regions. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The fruit, while edible, is often overshadowed by more commercially popular blackberry varieties."
