    "intro": "Rubus rufus var. rufus, commonly known as the red raspberry, is a perennial shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically serrated and hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, hairy berries in the summer. These berries are edible, juicy, and have a tart flavor, making them popular for culinary use. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
