    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis var. comptulus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thornless stems and small, elliptical leaves with a serrated margin. The plant produces clusters of small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
