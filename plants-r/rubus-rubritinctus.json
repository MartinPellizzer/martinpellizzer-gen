It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, often with a slightly tart flavor. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets that are serrated along the edges. This species is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
