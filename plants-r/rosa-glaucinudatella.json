It is characterized by its pale green, fuzzy stems and leaves with prominent, whitish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
