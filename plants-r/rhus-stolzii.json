    "intro": "Rhus stolzii, commonly known as the Desert Buckthorn, is a small evergreen shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and small, elliptical leaves that are typically gray-green in color. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, red berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Rhus stolzii is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. Its compact growth habit and ornamental appeal make it a popular choice for xeriscaping and landscape design in desert regions."
