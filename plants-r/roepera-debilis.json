It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and along stream banks. The plant features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, white flowers bloom in late spring, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Roepera debilis is known for its low maintenance and ability to thrive in shaded, wet conditions."
