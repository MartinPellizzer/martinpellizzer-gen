    "intro": "Rollinia longipetala, commonly known as the long-petaled starfruit, is a tropical plant native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Caricaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, star-shaped fruits that are typically yellow when ripe. The plant produces large, palmately lobed leaves and has a short, stout stem with a woody base. Its flowers are fragrant and white, often blooming in clusters, and it is valued for both its ornamental and edible qualities. The fruit, while not as commonly consumed as other starfruit varieties, is appreciated for its unique flavor and texture."
