    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. obscurus, commonly known as the darkleaf castor, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its dark green, almost black foliage. This form exhibits a more compact growth habit compared to the typical castor plant, with leaves that are broader and more elongated. The plant produces the same spiny, capsule-like seed pods as the standard Ricinus communis, containing toxic seeds used in traditional medicine and industry. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Its unique leaf coloration makes it a distinctive addition to botanical gardens and private collections."
