    "intro": "Rorippa palustris var. williamsii, commonly known as the Williams' watercress, is a flowering plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, characterized by its small, cruciform flowers and pinnately divided leaves. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are edible and have a peppery taste similar to other watercress species. The variety is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology and habitat preferences compared to the standard Rorippa palustris."
