    "intro": "Rubus vistulanus, commonly known as the Vistula raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and along riverbanks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
