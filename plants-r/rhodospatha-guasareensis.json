It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, showy floral structures. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest undergrowth where it can receive indirect sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink or purple, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat threats, it is considered a vulnerable species in conservation efforts."
