    "intro": "Rumex arvensis, commonly known as common sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. The plant contains oxalic acid, which gives it a sharp, tangy taste and makes it a popular culinary herb. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. Its botanical characteristics make it both a useful plant in traditional medicine and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
