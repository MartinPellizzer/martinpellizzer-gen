    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 lapicidinarum, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring a shrub-like growth habit with thorny stems and compound leaves. Its flowers are typically white or pale yellow, and it produces small, edible berries that are often a mix of blackberry and raspberry flavors. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or disturbed soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit genetic variability in morphology and fruit quality."
