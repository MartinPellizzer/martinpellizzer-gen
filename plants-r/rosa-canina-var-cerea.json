    "intro": "Rosa canina var. cerea, commonly known as the sweet briar rose, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its dense, arching stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red hips, which are the fruit and contain numerous seeds. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven oval leaflets, and the plant is often used in hedgerows or as a decorative shrub. Rosa canina var. cerea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in perfumery and traditional medicine."
