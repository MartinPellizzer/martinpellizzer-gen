    "intro": "Rechsteineria calcaria f. macrophylla, commonly known as the giant rock cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its robust growth and distinctive foliage. It features basal leaves that are large, broad, and often hairy, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine environments. Due to its unique morphology and habitat preferences, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
