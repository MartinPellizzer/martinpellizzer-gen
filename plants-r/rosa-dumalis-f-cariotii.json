    "intro": "Rosa dumalis f. cariotii, commonly known as the Cariotii form of the alpine rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thornless stems and is characterized by its clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and the plant is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness. This form is often cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings due to its compact growth habit and showy blooms."
