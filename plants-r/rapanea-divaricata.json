    "intro": "Rapanea divaricata, commonly known as the variegated holly, is a small evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves with white or yellow variegation, which add visual interest to the plant. The plant produces small, white flowers that are followed by red, fleshy berries, which are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value and adaptability make it a popular choice for both landscape and container gardening."
