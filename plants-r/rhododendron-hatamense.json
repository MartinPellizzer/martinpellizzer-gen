    "intro": "Rhododendron hatamense, commonly known as the Hatam's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral displays. Rhododendron hatamense is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cool, moist climates."
