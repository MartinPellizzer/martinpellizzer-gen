    "intro": "Rumex crispus subsp. littoreus, commonly known as sea sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its distinctive, crinkled, serrated leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, branched stalks. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, often found in salt marshes, dunes, and coastal meadows. Sea sorrel is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions, including high salinity, strong winds, and periodic flooding."
