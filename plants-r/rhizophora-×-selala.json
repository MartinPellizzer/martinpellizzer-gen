    "intro": "Rhizophora \u00d7 selala, commonly known as the mangrove hybrid, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora stylosa. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in saline and brackish water environments, making it an important species in coastal ecosystems. The plant exhibits pneumatophores, which are specialized root structures that facilitate gas exchange in waterlogged soils. Its propagules are buoyant and can float for long distances, aiding in its dispersal. Rhizophora \u00d7 selala plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various marine and terrestrial species."
