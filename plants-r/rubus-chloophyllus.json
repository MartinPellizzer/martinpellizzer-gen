    "intro": "Rubus chloophyllus, commonly known as the chlorophyllous bramble, is a rare species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant is notable for its unusually high concentration of chlorophyll, giving its leaves a deep green hue. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in temperate forest understories. Due to its limited geographic range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
