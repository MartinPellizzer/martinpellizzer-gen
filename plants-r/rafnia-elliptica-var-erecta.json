It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in warm, humid climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. This variant is distinguished by its upright growth habit, which sets it apart from other varieties of Rafnia elliptica."
