It is characterized by its swollen, colorful tuberous stem, which is actually a grafted hybrid of two different cactus species. The plant's botanical features include a short, thick stem with spines and a fleshy, segmented body that stores water. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires bright sunlight to maintain its vibrant colors. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated as a houseplant."
