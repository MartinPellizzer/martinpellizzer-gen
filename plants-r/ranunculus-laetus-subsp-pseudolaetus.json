    "intro": "Ranunculus laetus subsp. pseudolaetus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical R. laetus. It thrives in cool, moist environments such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant is often found at high altitudes, where it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators."
