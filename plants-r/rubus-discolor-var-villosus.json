    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. villosus, commonly known as the hairy bramble, is a variant of the discolor raspberry. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its hairy texture, as suggested by its scientific name, is a notable botanical feature."
