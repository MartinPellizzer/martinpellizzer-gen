    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leaf rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are typically large, ovate, and have a soft, velvety texture, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in cooler climates."
