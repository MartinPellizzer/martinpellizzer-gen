    "intro": "Rubus hystrix, commonly known as the prickly rose or bristly blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are usually dark purple to black when mature. These berries are edible, though they are often described as having a tart and slightly astringent flavor. Rubus hystrix is native to regions of Europe and Asia and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
