    "intro": "Rochea microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved rochea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its composite flower heads. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in arid or semi-arid environments. Its small, lance-shaped leaves are arranged alternately along the stem, and it produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in the spring. Rochea microphylla is often used in native plant gardens for its ornamental value and drought tolerance."
