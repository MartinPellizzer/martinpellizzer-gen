    "intro": "Rosa canina f. sphaerophylla, commonly known as the spherical-leaved dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its rounded, thick, and often reddish leaves that differ from the typical ovate shape of the species. The plant produces fragrant pink flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, berry-like hips in autumn. It is a shrub native to Europe and is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
