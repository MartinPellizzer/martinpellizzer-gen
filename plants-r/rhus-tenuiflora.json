    "intro": "Rhus tenuiflora, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged with narrow, elongated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a common food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, sandy soils. Rhus tenuiflora is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
