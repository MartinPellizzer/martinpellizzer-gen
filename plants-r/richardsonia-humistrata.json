    "intro": "Richardsonia humistrata, commonly known as the coastal bladderwort, is a flowering plant native to the coastal regions of southern Africa. It is a small herbaceous plant characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, inconspicuous flowers. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils near the coast, often in areas with high salinity and strong winds. Its unique adaptations include specialized structures for water retention and salt excretion. It plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and supporting local insect populations."
