    "intro": "Rhamnus infectoria f. nana, commonly known as dwarf common buckthorn, is a compact shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of less than 1 meter, featuring dense, thornless stems and small, oval-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or hedgerows. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes classified as a noxious weed."
