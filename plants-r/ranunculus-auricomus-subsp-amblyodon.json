    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. amblyodon, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate to heart-shaped, with a distinctive waxy coating that gives them a shiny appearance. The flowers are typically yellow with five petal-like sepals, and they bloom in early spring. The plant prefers moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. It is characterized by its subsp. amblyodon variant, which distinguishes it from other subspecies through subtle differences in leaf shape and size."
