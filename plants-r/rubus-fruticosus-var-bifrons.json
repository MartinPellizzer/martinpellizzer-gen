    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. bifrons, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color. These berries are edible, though the stems and leaves are generally not consumed. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and disturbed areas."
