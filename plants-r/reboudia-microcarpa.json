    "intro": "Reboudia microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited spurge, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family, characterized by its milky sap and showy, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows as an annual herb with simple, alternate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are clustered in cyathia, which are cup-shaped structures typical of the spurge family. Reboudia microcarpa is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in a variety of habitats, including fields and along roadsides."
