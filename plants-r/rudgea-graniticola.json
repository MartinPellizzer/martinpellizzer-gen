    "intro": "Rudgea graniticola, commonly known as the granite rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It belongs to the Moraceae family, which includes figs and mulberries. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and thick, leathery leaves that are adapted to thrive in rocky, well-drained soils. It produces small, clustered greenish-white flowers, followed by edible fig-like fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Rudgea graniticola is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
