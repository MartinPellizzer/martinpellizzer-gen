    "intro": "Rubus serpens proles brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed blackberry shrub, is a species of brambles native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its trailing or prostrate growth habit, with short, stiff stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they may have a somewhat tart flavor. Its leaves are compound, consisting of three to five oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forest floors or along stream banks."
