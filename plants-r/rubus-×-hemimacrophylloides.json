It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible, juicy berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its flavor and use in jams, pies, and other culinary applications."
