    "intro": "Rubus leucandrus, commonly known as the white-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its slender, often hairy stems and small, white or pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, tart berries that are typically less flavorful than other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
