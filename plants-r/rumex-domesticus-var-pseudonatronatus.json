    "intro": "Rumex domesticus var. pseudonatronatus, commonly known as the coastal sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel that thrives in saline and coastal environments. It is characterized by its succulent, fleshy leaves that are adapted to retain moisture in arid or salty conditions. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typical of the Polygonaceae family. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively and colonize disturbed coastal soils. This variant is often found in estuarine and tidal areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing sediment and providing habitat for coastal wildlife."
