    "intro": "Rhus cotinus atropurpurea, commonly known as smokebush, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its showy, feathery panicles of pink to purple flowers that appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves that are typically grayish-green with a fuzzy texture. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Its ornamental value comes from its vibrant fall color, which ranges from red to orange."
