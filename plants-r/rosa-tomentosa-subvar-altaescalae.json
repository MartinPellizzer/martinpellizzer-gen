    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa subvar. altaescalae, commonly known as the Alpine woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive woolly appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. It thrives in cool, high-altitude environments with well-drained soil. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in alpine gardens."
