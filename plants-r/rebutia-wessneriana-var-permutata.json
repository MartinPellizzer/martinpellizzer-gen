    "intro": "Rebutia wessneriana var. permutata, commonly known as the Permutated Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to South America. It features a globular or cylindrical stem covered in dense, spiny areoles, which are characteristic of the Cactaceae family. The plant produces showy, brightly colored flowers that typically bloom in spring or early summer. Its foliage is often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina, which helps reduce water loss. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in a well-drained soil environment."
