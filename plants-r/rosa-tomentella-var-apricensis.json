    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. apricensis, commonly known as the Sierra Valley rose, is a shrub native to the western United States, particularly found in California's Sierra Nevada foothills. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments. Its leaves are hairy and have a distinctive grayish-white appearance, while its stems are covered in fine, white hairs. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in supporting local pollinators."
