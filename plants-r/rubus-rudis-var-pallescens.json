    "intro": "Rubus rudis var. pallescens, commonly known as the pale raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and small, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the plant produces small, hairy fruits that are typically less flavorful than common raspberries. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
