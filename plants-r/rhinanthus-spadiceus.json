    "intro": "Rhinanthus spadiceus, commonly known as the common tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers in clusters, typically blooming from June to August. It thrives in open habitats such as grasslands, heaths, and woodland edges. Rhinanthus spadiceus plays an important role in supporting pollinators like bees and butterflies."
