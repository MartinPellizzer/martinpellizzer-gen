    "intro": "Rothmannia attopevensis, commonly known as the Attopevense rothmannia, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa. It is a perennial herb characterized by its distinctive rosette of narrow, linear leaves and small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom during the summer months. The plant thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to the harsh climatic conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and threats from habitat loss, it is classified as critically endangered by the IUCN Red List. Conservation efforts are ongoing to protect and propagate this unique botanical species."
