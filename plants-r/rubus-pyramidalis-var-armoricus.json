    "intro": "Rubus pyramidalis var. armoricus, commonly known as the Appalachian blackberry, is a variant of the pyramidal blackberry species native to the eastern United States. It is a thorny shrub that produces small, dark purple to black berries, which are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The berries are edible, though they are generally less sweet and more tart compared to other blackberry varieties."
