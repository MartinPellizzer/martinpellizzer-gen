    "intro": "Rhinanthus subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine yellow toadflax, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its parasitic growth habit, though it is not entirely parasitic and can photosynthesize. The plant produces bright yellow flowers with two lips, typical of the genus Rhinanthus. It thrives in rocky and open habitats at high altitudes, often found in mountain meadows. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
