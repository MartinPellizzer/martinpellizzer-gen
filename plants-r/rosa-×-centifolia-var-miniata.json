    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 centifolia var. miniata, commonly known as the miniature pink or miniature damask rose, is a hybrid species within the rose family. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is typically smaller than standard roses, making it ideal for container gardening or small spaces. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to fully double flowers in shades of pink, often with a white or pale pink base. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often used in floral arrangements due to its delicate appearance and strong fragrance."
