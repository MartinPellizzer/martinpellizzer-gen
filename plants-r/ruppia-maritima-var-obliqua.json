    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. obliqua, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a halophytic plant that thrives in saline environments such as coastal wetlands and estuaries. It is characterized by its slender, linear leaves and small, clustered flowers that bloom in the summer months. The plant has a shallow root system adapted to withstand tidal fluctuations and waterlogged soils. It plays a crucial role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms. Its ability to tolerate high salinity makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
