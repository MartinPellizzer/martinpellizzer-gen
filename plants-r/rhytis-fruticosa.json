    "intro": "Rhytis fruticosa, commonly known as the shrub of the genus Rhytis, is a small evergreen shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters and features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for coastal gardens. Its ornamental value comes from its compact form and seasonal color changes."
