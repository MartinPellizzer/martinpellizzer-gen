    "intro": "Rubus radula var. cantianus, commonly known as the Cantian blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are palmately compound, with three to five leaflets, and it produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. The fruit is often used in jams and preserves due to its tart flavor and high pectin content."
