    "intro": "Ruehssia saturejifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leaved saturejifolia, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes many aromatic herbs such as carrots and parsley. The plant is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves and small, clustered white or greenish flowers. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
