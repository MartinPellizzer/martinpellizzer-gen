    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. aculeolatus, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Asia and Australia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as stream banks and forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are often used in culinary applications, though they are generally more tart than those of other blackberry varieties."
