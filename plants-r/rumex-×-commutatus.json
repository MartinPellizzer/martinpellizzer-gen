    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 commutatus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinatus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as meadows, roadsides, and woodland edges. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
