    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. fugax, commonly known as the transient rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that bloom briefly in late spring or early summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are dark green and glossy, with a slightly serrated edge. Due to its limited distribution and short flowering period, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a challenging plant to cultivate."
