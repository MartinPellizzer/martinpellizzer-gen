    "intro": "Rourea antioquensis, commonly known as the Antioquia rourea, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its woody stems and dense, evergreen foliage. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cooler, moist conditions. Its small, clustered flowers are usually greenish-yellow, and it produces small, fleshy fruits that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rourea antioquensis is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
