    "intro": "Rosa molliangermana, commonly known as the soft-haired rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant features hairy foliage, which gives it its common name and helps it retain moisture in arid environments. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens in temperate climates."
