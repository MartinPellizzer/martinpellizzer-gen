It features trifoliate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces clusters of small, yellow flowers. The plant bears pods that contain edible, kidney-shaped seeds, similar to those of other cowpea species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used for forage or as a green manure crop. Its botanical characteristics make it an important plant in both agricultural and ecological contexts."
