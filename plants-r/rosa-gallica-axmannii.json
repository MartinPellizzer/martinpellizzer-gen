    "intro": "Rosa gallica axmannii, commonly known as the Axmann's Gallic Rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its flowers are often covered in soft, white or pale yellow hairs. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical significance in horticulture. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
