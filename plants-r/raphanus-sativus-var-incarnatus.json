    "intro": "Raphanus sativus var. incarnatus, commonly known as the red radish, is a cultivated variety of the wild radish species. It is characterized by its vibrant red skin and crisp, mildly spicy flesh, which are the result of genetic mutations and selective breeding. The plant typically grows to a height of 20\u201340 cm, with a rosette of pinnately lobed leaves. Its root is the primary edible part, often harvested when small for optimal flavor and texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal as well as its culinary uses in various cuisines around the world."
