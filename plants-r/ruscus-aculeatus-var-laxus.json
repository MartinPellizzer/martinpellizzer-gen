    "intro": "Ruscus aculeatus var. laxus, commonly known as the creeping spurge or common euonymus, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It features dense, fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, and it produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring. The plant is characterized by its ability to thrive in rocky or dry soils, making it a hardy species suitable for xeriscaping. Its botanical name reflects its close relation to the genus Ruscus, which includes other species with similar morphological traits. The varietal name \"laxus\" refers to its more loosely spaced leaves compared to other varieties within the species."
