    "intro": "Ranunculus inclinatus, commonly known as the bent-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often curled or folded, giving it its common name. Its flowers are usually bright yellow with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It produces small, smooth-seeded fruits that are dispersed by wind, contributing to its spread in suitable habitats."
