    "intro": "Rhynchospora chinensis var. curvoaristata, commonly known as the curved-awned marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in East Asia. It typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant has linear, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and colonize wetland environments effectively. The species is notable for its distinctive awn-like structures on the bracts, which contribute to its common name."
