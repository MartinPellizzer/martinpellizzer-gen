    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. baldensis, commonly known as the Bald Mountain rose, is a shrub-like species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, thriving at high elevations. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a soft, white pubescence, which helps protect it from harsh weather conditions. This variety is notable for its hardiness and is often found in mountainous regions of California and Nevada."
