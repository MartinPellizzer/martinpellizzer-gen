It typically exhibits thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, drupe-like berries, which are often red or black when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland or shrubland habitats. Due to its hybrid nature, it can exhibit a wide range of morphological variations."
