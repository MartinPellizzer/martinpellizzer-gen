    "intro": "Ranunculus glacialis var. camissonis, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in a dense layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in rocky soils and alpine meadows, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
