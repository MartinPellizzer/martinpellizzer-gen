    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 exsul, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that results from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (lamb's tongue). It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color, especially when young. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on tall, erect stems. Rumex \u00d7 exsul thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Its foliage is edible but contains oxalic acid, so it should be consumed in moderation."
