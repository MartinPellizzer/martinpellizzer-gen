    "intro": "Russelia rotundifolia f. velutina, commonly known as the velvet russelia, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the Andean regions of South America. It features glossy, oval-shaped leaves that are densely covered in fine, velvety hairs, giving it a soft, textured appearance. The plant produces clusters of tubular, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom throughout the growing season. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-draining, acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a container plant."
