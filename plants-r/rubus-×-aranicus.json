    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 aranicus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant that results from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. Its flowers are pink to white and are followed by the distinctive, edible berries that are prized for their tart flavor. The species is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its use in culinary applications."
