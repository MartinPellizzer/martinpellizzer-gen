    "intro": "Roylea elegans, commonly known as the elegant rock orchid, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of India and Nepal. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, often epiphytic growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, with intricate patterns on the petals. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found growing on rocky substrates or in forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Roylea elegans is considered a rare and endangered species."
