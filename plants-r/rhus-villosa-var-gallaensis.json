    "intro": "Rhus villosa var. gallaensis, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually pinnately arranged with 11 to 31 leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, spiny fruits in the fall. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate urban environments."
