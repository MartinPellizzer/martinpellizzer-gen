    "intro": "Ruschiella cedrimontana, commonly known as the Cedrimontana bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue to violet flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in alpine or subalpine environments. It has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that bloom in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
