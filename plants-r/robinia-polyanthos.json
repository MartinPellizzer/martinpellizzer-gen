    "intro": "Robinia polyanthos, commonly known as the false acacia or blossom tree, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The tree produces showy, fragrant flowers in clusters, typically in late spring, which are borne in pendulous racemes. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often covered in a layer of dead wood. The plant is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia bacteria in its root nodules."
