    "intro": "Rourea usaramensis, commonly known as the Usaramensis rourea, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is characterized by its woody stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
