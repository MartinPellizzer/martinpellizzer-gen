    "intro": "Ribes rubrum f. glabellum, commonly known as the smooth-fruited gooseberry, is a botanical variant of the common gooseberry. It is characterized by its smooth, glabrous fruit surface, distinguishing it from the typical rough-textured form. The plant is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, while the flowers are yellow and borne in clusters. The fruit, which matures in late summer, is edible and has a tart flavor, often used in jams and preserves."
