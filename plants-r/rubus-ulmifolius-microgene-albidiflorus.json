    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius microgene albidiflorus, commonly known as the white-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its white flowers, which distinguish it from the typical pink or red blooms of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful than those of its relatives. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it a notable species in both horticultural and ecological contexts."
