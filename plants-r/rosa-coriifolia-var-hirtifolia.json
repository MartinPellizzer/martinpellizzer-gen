    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. hirtifolia, commonly known as the hairy leaf dogwood rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate with a hairy texture, giving the plant its botanical name. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. This variety is closely related to Rosa coriifolia, but its hairy foliage distinguishes it in the genus."
