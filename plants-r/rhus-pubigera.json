    "intro": "Rhus pubigera, commonly known as the pubescent sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a distinctive feature. Rhus pubigera thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its botanical features make it an important plant in ecological studies and traditional herbal medicine."
