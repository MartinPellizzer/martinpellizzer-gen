    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. hibernicus, commonly known as sheep's sorrel, is a perennial herb native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features upright, hairy stems that bear alternate, heart-shaped leaves with reddish veins. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by triangular, beak-like fruits. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
