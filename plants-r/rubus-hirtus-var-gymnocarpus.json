    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. gymnocarpus, commonly known as the smooth-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The flowers are usually white or pale green, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes that mature to a dark purple or black color. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. It is valued for its edible fruit, which has a tart flavor and is used in jams and pies."
