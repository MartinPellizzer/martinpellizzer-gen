    "intro": "Rumex japonicus var. sachalinensis, commonly known as Japanese sorrel, is a perennial herb native to East Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish coloration on the underside, which is a characteristic trait of the Rumex genus. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shady environments. The leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor, making it a traditional vegetable in some Asian cuisines."
