    "intro": "Ranunculus lanuginosus var. geraniifolius, commonly known as the velvetleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, nodding flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow to orange, surrounded by a dense ring of stamens. The leaves are palmately divided, with a soft, velvety texture that gives the plant its common name. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and stream banks. The plant is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its attractive, early spring blooms."
