    "intro": "Rosa eustola, commonly known as the everglade rose, is a shrub native to the wetlands of southern Florida. It is characterized by its dark green, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in swampy areas. Its stems are covered in soft, white hairs, and it produces small, red-orange fruits that are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. Rosa eustola plays an important ecological role in its habitat by providing food and shelter for various wildlife species."
