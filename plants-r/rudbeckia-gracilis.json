    "intro": "Rudbeckia gracilis, commonly known as the slender coneflower, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features upright, slender stems that bear daisy-like yellow flower heads with dark central cones. The plant typically grows to a height of 2 to 4 feet and produces showy, composite flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Rudbeckia gracilis thrives in full sun to partial shade and is well-suited for moist, well-drained soils in garden settings."
