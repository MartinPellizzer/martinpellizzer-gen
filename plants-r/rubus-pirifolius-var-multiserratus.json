    "intro": "Rubus pirifolius var. multiserratus, commonly known as the multifoliolate blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically divided into multiple lobes, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are similar in structure to blackberries but often have a more delicate flavor. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. The botanical features of this plant make it a subject of interest in both horticulture and ecological studies."
