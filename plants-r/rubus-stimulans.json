    "intro": "Rubus stimulans, commonly known as the stimulant raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It produces small, red, edible berries that are prized for their tart flavor and high vitamin C content. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight, often growing in rocky or forested habitats. The berries are not only a food source for wildlife but also have traditional medicinal uses among indigenous communities."
