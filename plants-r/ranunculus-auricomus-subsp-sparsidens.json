    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. sparsidens, commonly known as the slenderleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, often with a distinctive yellow center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are typically arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The subspecies is distinguished by its more slender leaves and slightly different floral structure compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
