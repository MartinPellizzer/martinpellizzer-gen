    "intro": "Randia brandzeana, commonly known as the redroot randia, is a shrub native to tropical regions of Africa. It features simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
