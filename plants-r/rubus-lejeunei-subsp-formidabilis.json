    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei subsp. formidabilis, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a subspecies of the Rubus genus native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and broad, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically large and have a strong, tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its size and robust growth, it plays a significant role in local ecosystems as both a food source and habitat provider."
