    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and thornless stems, which contribute to its ornamental appeal. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fuzzy hips. It thrives in partial shade to full sun and prefers well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its hardiness and aesthetic value, it is often used in landscaping for hedges or as a specimen plant."
