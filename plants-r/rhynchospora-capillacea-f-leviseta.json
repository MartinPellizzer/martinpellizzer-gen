    "intro": "Rhynchospora capillacea f. leviseta, commonly known as the smooth-haired marsh sedge, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is a perennial herb characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typical of the sedge family. It thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and swampy areas, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting aquatic ecosystems. Its morphology reflects adaptations to its moist, often nutrient-poor habitat."
