    "intro": "Rumex tuberosus subsp. horizontalis, commonly known as the horizontal sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are heart-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in spring. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. The leaves and roots are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
