It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that displays a striking purple hue, especially during the growing season. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers, typically in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes for its vibrant color and hardy nature."
