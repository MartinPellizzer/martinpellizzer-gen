It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its sprawling growth habit and hairy stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green fruits that are encased in a papery husk, which turns red as the fruit matures. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and covered with fine, whitish hairs. Randia tomatillo is often cultivated for its ornamental value and can also be used in traditional herbal medicine."
