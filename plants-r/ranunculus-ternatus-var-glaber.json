    "intro": "Ranunculus ternatus var. glaber, commonly known as the smooth meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually lobed or entire. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five sepals that resemble petals, a characteristic common in the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, open habitats such as meadows and wetlands. The smooth, hairless stem and leaves contribute to its distinctive appearance and help in its identification."
