These plants are characterized by their distinctive leaves, which often have a lobed or divided appearance. Ramisia species are typically found in temperate regions and thrive in moist, well-drained soils. They produce small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The genus includes several species, some of which are cultivated for their ornamental value in gardens."
