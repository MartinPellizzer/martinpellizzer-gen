    "intro": "Rubus stenocalycinus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Central America and the Caribbean. It is characterized by its trailing or shrub-like growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and it is often found in moist, shaded areas. The fruit is edible but has a tart flavor, making it a minor but notable species within the Rubus genus."
