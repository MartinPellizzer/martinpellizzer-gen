    "intro": "Ranunculus minutulus, commonly known as the minute buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic plants. The species is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, low-growing habit. It typically thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Due to its small size and specific habitat requirements, it is often overlooked but plays a role in local ecosystems."
