    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the river buttercup, is a aquatic flowering plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving streams, ponds, and wetlands, with its rhizomes anchoring it to the substrate. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens and a central pistil. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps repel water. The species is adapted to aquatic conditions, with submerged and floating leaves that aid in photosynthesis and nutrient absorption."
