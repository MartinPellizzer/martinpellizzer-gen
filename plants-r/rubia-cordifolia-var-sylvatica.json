    "intro": "Rubia cordifolia var. sylvatica, commonly known as the wild madder, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its roots are characterized by their deep red color, which contains valuable pigments used in traditional dyeing practices. This variant is often found in woodland edges and shaded areas, thriving in moist, well-drained soils."
