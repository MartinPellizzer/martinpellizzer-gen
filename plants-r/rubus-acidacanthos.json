    "intro": "Rubus acidacanthos, commonly known as the sour thorn raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, containing several drupelets. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its rugged appearance and edible fruits, it is of interest to both botanists and foragers."
