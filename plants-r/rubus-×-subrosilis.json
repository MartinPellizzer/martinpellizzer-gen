    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 subrosilis, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus and Rubus pectoralis. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and is characterized by its dense, thorny shrubs and dark, edible berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and have a serrated margin, while its flowers are small and white or pink. The berries mature to a deep black color and are often used in culinary applications due to their tart flavor."
