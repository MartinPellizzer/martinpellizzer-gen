It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, while its flowers range in color from white to pink.
