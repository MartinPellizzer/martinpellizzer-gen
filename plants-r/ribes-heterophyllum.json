It is characterized by its alternate, simple, and ovate to elliptic leaves that are often reddish-brown underneath. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as berries, which are typically red when mature. These berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in jams and jellies. Ribes heterophyllum thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
