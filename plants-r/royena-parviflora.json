    "intro": "Royena parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered royal lily, is a striking member of the Araceae family native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, showy spathe that surrounds a spadix, typical of the arum family. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered around the spadix, contributing to its ornamental appeal. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and requires consistent humidity to flourish. Due to its unique appearance and growth habits, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
