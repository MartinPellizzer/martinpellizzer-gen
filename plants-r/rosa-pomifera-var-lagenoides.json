    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. lagenoides, commonly known as the giant rose or Chinese rose, is a species native to China and parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 10 centimeters in diameter, typically in shades of pink, red, or white. The plant produces a unique, fruit-like structure called a \"false fruit\" or \"rose hip,\" which is actually an aggregate of follicles. It thrives in temperate climates and prefers well-drained soil with partial to full sunlight. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
