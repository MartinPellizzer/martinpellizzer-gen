    "intro": "Ranunculus natans var. intertextus, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a water plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, which help it remain buoyant on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are rhizomatous, allowing it to spread across wetlands and shallow water bodies. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates and serving as a food source for various waterfowl."
