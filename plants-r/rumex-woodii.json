    "intro": "Rumex woodii, commonly known as Wood's sorrel, is a herbaceous perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid. Rumex woodii is also known for its ability to thrive in poor soil conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
