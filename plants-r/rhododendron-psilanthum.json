    "intro": "Rhododendron psilanthum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant features dark green, narrow leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in horticulture."
