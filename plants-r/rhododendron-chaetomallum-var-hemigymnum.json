    "intro": "Rhododendron chaetomallum var. hemigymnum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage with thick, leathery leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery down. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Due to its compact size and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a hardy, visually appealing plant for shaded areas."
