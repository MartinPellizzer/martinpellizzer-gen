    "intro": "Roldana hederoides, commonly known as the creeping wood sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive waxy coating and small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas. Its stems spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent soil erosion. Botanically, it belongs to the family Oxalidaceae and is characterized by its edible leaves and flowers, though they should be consumed in moderation."
