It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals that are often reflexed backward. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically hairy and covered in a waxy cuticle. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky areas.
