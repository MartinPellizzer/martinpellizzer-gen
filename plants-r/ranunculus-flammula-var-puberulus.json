    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula var. puberulus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features a basal rosette of finely divided, hairy leaves and produces yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its pubescent (hairy) foliage, which distinguishes it from other varieties of Ranunculus flammula. The hairy buttercup is often found in damp, calcareous soils and is an important part of the understory flora in its native habitats."
