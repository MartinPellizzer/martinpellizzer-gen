It features compact, rosette-shaped leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires minimal water, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its ornamental value and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for gardeners in arid climates."
