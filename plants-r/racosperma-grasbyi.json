    "intro": "Racosperma grasbyi, commonly known as the Grasby's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant features bipinnate leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces yellow to orange flowers in spikes. Racosperma grasbyi is adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that help it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and provides habitat for local wildlife."
