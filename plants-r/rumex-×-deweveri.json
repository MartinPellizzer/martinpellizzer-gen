    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 deweveri, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobipinus (broad-leaved sorrel). It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and red stems. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its flowers are small and greenish, arranged in loose clusters, and it produces seeds that are dispersed by wind. The hybrid is notable for its variability in leaf shape and size, which can make it challenging to distinguish from its parent species."
