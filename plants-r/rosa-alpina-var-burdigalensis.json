    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. burdigalensis, commonly known as the Burdigalian alpine rose, is a rare and hardy species native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
