    "intro": "Rhysotoechia momiensis, commonly known as the Momian rock orchid, is a rare and specialized plant found in specific rocky habitats. It belongs to the orchid family (Orchidaceae) and is characterized by its unique floral structure and adaptations to its harsh environment. The plant produces small, intricate flowers that are often camouflaged to blend with its surroundings. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from crevices in limestone or basalt formations. Due to its limited distribution and ecological sensitivity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
