    "intro": "Rhaponticum salinum, commonly known as sea holly, is a perennial plant native to the arid regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its silver-gray, fuzzy leaves and striking blue or purple flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to harsh, coastal environments. Its unique morphology helps it conserve water and withstand extreme temperatures. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
