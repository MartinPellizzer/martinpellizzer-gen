    "intro": "Rytidosperma caespitosum, commonly known as the tussock grass, is a perennial grass species native to Australia. It is characterized by its dense, clump-forming growth habit and is often found in sandy or rocky soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences. It is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a common component of native grasslands. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
