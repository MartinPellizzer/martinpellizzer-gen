    "intro": "Rhodocactus conzattii, commonly known as the Conzatti's night bloomer, is a rare and striking cactus native to the dry, rocky regions of Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, cylindrical stems that are often covered in a dense layer of white, woolly hair, which helps to reduce water loss in its arid habitat. The plant produces large, showy flowers that open at night, typically in shades of white or pale yellow, attracting nocturnal pollinators such as moths. Its unique morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat destruction and over-collection, it is considered endangered in its native range."
