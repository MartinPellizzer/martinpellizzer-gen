    "intro": "Rosa canina f. exilis, commonly known as the slender dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its more compact growth habit and smaller, more delicate flowers. It typically features pink to reddish-pink blooms that appear in late spring to early summer. The plant has thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rosa genus. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
