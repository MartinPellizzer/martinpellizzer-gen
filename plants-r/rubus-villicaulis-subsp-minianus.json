    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis subsp. minianus, commonly known as the Minianus blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
