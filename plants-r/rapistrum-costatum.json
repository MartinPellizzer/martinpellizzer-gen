    "intro": "Rapistrum costatum, commonly known as the sea rocket or rocket grass, is a flowering plant native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of fleshy, lobed leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in saline environments. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically arranged in dense, terminal clusters. It thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Rapistrum costatum is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and ornamental value."
