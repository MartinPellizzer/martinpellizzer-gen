It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Its botanical features make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
