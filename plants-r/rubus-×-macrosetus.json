    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 macrosetus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry. It is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or shaded areas. Its ornamental value is notable due to its attractive foliage and persistent berries throughout the winter."
