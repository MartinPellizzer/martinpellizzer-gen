It thrives in moist or aquatic environments, often found in streams, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has a rosette of smooth, arrow-shaped leaves that are typically 2-5 cm in length. Its flowers are arranged in racemes and produce small, round seeds that are dispersed by water. Rorippa sinapis is valued for its peppery flavor and is used in culinary applications, though it is also considered an invasive species in some regions."
