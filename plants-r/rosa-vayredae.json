    "intro": "Rosa vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda rose, is a rare and endangered species native to the mountainous regions of South America. This shrub-like plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant has a woody stem covered in thorns. Rosa vayredae thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude habitats. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
