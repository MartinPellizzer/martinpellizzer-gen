    "intro": "Rhodosciadium glaucum var. glaucum, commonly known as the blue-green milkweed, is a perennial herb native to arid and semi-arid regions of Africa. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems that are often covered in a bluish-white powdery coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense inflorescences, which bloom during the rainy season. Its leaves are narrow and opposite, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The plant is adapted to survive in harsh environments and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
