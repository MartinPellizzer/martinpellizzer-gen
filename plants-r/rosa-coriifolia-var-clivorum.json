    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. clivorum, commonly known as the cliff rose or mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers in early spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with finely toothed leaflets, and the plant is often found growing on rocky slopes or in alpine meadows. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and seasonal blooms. The variety clivorum is distinguished by its more compact growth and slightly different flowering pattern compared to the typical form of Rosa coriifolia."
