    "intro": "Ranunculus utahensis, commonly known as the Utah buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or white petals. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
