    "intro": "Rhynchosia thorncroftii, commonly known as the Thorncroft's burrbean, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, spiny pods that enclose the seeds. The plant typically grows as an annual herb, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and features trifoliate leaves with a rough texture. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in racemes, and it produces a unique, three-lobed fruit that aids in seed dispersal. Due to its ornamental and ecological value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
