    "intro": "Rhaponticum coniferum, commonly known as the Siberian cowpea, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Siberia and Central Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces yellow flowers arranged in a flat-topped inflorescence, which bloom in late summer. Its seeds are enclosed in long, slender pods and are used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Rhaponticum coniferum is adapted to harsh climates and is often found growing in rocky or sandy soils."
