It is a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish-purple flowers that bloom in summer. The plant has alternate, ovate leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in dry, sandy soils. It is often found in open habitats such as scrublands and coastal areas. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it is considered a weed in some agricultural settings."
