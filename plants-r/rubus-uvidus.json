    "intro": "Rubus uvidus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically serrated along the edges. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of edible berries in the summer. These berries are typically dark purple to black in color and have a tart, sweet flavor. Rubus uvidus is native to parts of Europe and Asia and is often found in woodland areas and along the edges of forests."
