    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. brachythyrsus, commonly known as the short-stalked blackberry, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, thorny stems and dense, mat-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are pinkish-white with five petals. This form is distinguished by its shorter thorns and more compact growth compared to the typical Rubus thyrsoideus."
