    "intro": "Rubus chlorocarpus, commonly known as the green-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, dark berries that are typically green when mature. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are white and clustered in umbels, and the fruit develops from a single carpel. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
