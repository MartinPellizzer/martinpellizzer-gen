    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. sandbergii, commonly known as sandberg's smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the central and eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry to mesic soils. Its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions make it a popular choice for landscaping and ecological restoration."
