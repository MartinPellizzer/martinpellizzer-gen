It is a terrestrial orchid characterized by its sympodial growth habit and the presence of pseudobulbs. The plant typically features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of fragrant, white to pale yellow flowers. It is native to the Andean regions of Ecuador and is adapted to high-altitude, cool, and humid environments. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in the wild."
