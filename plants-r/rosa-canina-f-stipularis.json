It is characterized by its distinctive stipules, which are leaf-like structures at the base of the petioles. This subspecies typically features pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance. The plant produces red, hairy hips that are rich in vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils across Europe and parts of Asia."
