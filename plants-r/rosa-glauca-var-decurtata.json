It features pale blue to violet flowers with a distinctive glaucous (waxy, bluish) coating on its foliage and stems. The plant has serrated, dark green leaves that are densely covered in fine hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
