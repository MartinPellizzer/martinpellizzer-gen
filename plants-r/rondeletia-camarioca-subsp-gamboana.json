    "intro": "Rondeletia camarioca subsp. gamboana, commonly known as the Brazilian flame flower, is a species native to the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil. It is a flowering plant in the family Malvaceae, characterized by its showy, tubular red or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant typically grows as an evergreen shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 3 meters. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered with a fine pubescence. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their nectar-rich structure and bright colors."
