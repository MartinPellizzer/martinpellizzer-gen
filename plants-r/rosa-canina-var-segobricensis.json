It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant produces red, hairy berries that are typically consumed by wildlife. It thrives in woodland edges and dry soils across parts of Europe. Botanically, it is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and floral structure compared to the more common Rosa canina."
