    "intro": "Raphanistrum innocuum var. album, commonly known as white foxtail, is a perennial grass species native to the United States. It is characterized by its tall, slender stalks and fluffy, white plumes that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in wetland areas, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, inconspicuous flowers that develop into the characteristic seed heads. White foxtail is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to spread easily."
