    "intro": "Rumex patientia subsp. tibeticus, commonly known as Tibetan dock, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of the Tibetan Plateau. It typically grows in rocky, arid environments and has thick, fleshy leaves adapted to conserve water. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are often hidden among the foliage. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to anchor firmly in loose, nutrient-poor soils. This subspecies is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes used in traditional medicine."
