    "intro": "Rubus stelliger var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shadowy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, berries and dense, thorny shrubs that thrive in shaded, moist environments. The leaves are typically elliptical with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves, and the plant produces edible fruits that are often smaller and more tart than those of other blackberry varieties. This plant is valued both for its ecological role in supporting local wildlife and for its unique flavor profile in culinary applications."
