    "intro": "Rhododendron niko-montanum f. plenum, commonly known as the Full-leaf Rhododendron, is a hybrid plant characterized by its dense, leathery foliage. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. The plant typically features showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white, which bloom in late spring. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens and as a container plant. The f. plenum form is distinguished by its fully developed leaves, which are broader and more densely packed than in the species form."
