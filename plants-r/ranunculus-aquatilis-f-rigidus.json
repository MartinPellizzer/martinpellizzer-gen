    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis f. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water buttercup, is a variant of the water buttercup native to wetland and aquatic environments. It is characterized by its rigid, upright stems and small, yellowish-green flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in ponds, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. This fern-like plant plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
