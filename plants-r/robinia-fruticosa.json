    "intro": "Robinia fruticosa, commonly known as the yellowwood or false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated margin. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in spring, followed by pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Its root system is extensive and can make it difficult to eradicate once established."
