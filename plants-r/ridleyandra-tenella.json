    "intro": "Ridleyandra tenella, commonly known as the narrow-leafed ridge fern, is a species of flowering plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Araliaceae and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces clusters of tiny, white flowers that are followed by small, berry-like fruits. Ridleyandra tenella thrives in moist, shaded environments, typically found in forest understories. Its unique morphology and ecological niche make it an interesting subject for botanical study."
