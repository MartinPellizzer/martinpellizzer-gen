    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 inconditus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chinensis (the blackberry). It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically dark red to black in color. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. The hybrid nature of Rubus \u00d7 inconditus contributes to its adaptability and variability in fruit characteristics."
