    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. popovii, commonly known as the Popov's hanging rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching stems that often trail over cliffs or rock faces, forming a cascading growth habit. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with ovate to lanceolate leaflets that are covered in a fine layer of white down. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a climbing plant in suitable climates."
