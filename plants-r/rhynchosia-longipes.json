    "intro": "Rhynchosia longipes, commonly known as the long-stemmed cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features compound leaves with a distinctive trifoliate structure, and its flowers are typically yellow or orange, with a long, slender corolla. The plant produces elongated pods that contain edible seeds, similar to those of other cowpea species. It is valued for its nutritional content and is often cultivated for both food and forage. Rhynchosia longipes is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
