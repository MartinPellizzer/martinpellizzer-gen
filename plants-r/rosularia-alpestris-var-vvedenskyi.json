    "intro": "Rosularia alpestris var. vvedenskyi, commonly known as the alpine rose or alpine rosularia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a compact rosette of fleshy, gray-green leaves that are adapted to withstand harsh, cold climates. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in the summer, which are clustered in dense inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine meadows and tundra environments. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in rock gardens and alpine settings."
