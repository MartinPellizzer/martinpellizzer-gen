    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. rossii, commonly known as the Ross's bristly rose, is a shrub-like species native to the high altitudes of the Andes in South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions with well-drained soils. Its stems are covered in a thick layer of fine hairs, giving it a distinctive, bristly appearance. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
