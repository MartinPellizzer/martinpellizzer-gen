    "intro": "Rubus rilstonei, commonly known as the Rilstone blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in the autumn. It thrives in cool, moist climates and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
