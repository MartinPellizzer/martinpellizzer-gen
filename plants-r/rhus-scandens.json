    "intro": "Rhus scandens, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are divided into pairs of oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces bright red, fuzzy fruits that appear in late summer and persist through winter. Its bark is thick and rugged, with a distinctive, scaly texture that gives it its common name. Staghorn sumac is often found in open woods, along stream banks, and in disturbed areas, where it thrives in full sun to partial shade."
