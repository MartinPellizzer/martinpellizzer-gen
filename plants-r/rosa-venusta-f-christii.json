    "intro": "Rosa venusta f. christii, commonly known as the Christ's rose, is a rare and ornamental hybrid rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its horticultural and historical significance."
