    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 blumeri, commonly known as the hybrid European buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are usually oval to elliptic in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
