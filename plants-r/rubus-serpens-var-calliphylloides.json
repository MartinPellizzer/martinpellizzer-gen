    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. calliphylloides, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on the leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland or swampy areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
