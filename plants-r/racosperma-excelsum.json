    "intro": "Racosperma excelsum, commonly known as the tall acacia, is a tall, woody shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, erect stem and compound leaves composed of multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces yellow, fluffy flower heads that appear in late winter to early spring, attracting various pollinators. Its seeds are enclosed in pod-like structures that split open to release the seeds. Racosperma excelsum is often found in open woodlands and along coastal areas, thriving in well-drained soils."
