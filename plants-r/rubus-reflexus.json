    "intro": "Rubus reflexus, commonly known as the hooked blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its flowers are white to pink and appear in clusters, often attracting pollinators like bees. Rubus reflexus is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, and it plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife."
