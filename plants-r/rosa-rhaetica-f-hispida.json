    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica f. hispida, commonly known as the Rhaetian rose, is a botanical variant of the Rhaetian rose species. It is characterized by its dense, bristly pubescence, which gives it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant is native to the alpine regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals, and bloom in late summer. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with specific horticultural care."
