    "intro": "Reseda ochracea, commonly known as yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, hairy stems and lance-shaped leaves that are arranged alternately along the stem. Yellow rattle is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. It plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by encouraging the growth of grasses in meadows."
