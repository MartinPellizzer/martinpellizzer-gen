It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, leafy blades that are often bluish-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are typically arranged in panicle-like clusters, with small, two-ranked florets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along riverbanks. Roegneria kaschgarica is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its fine texture and delicate appearance."
