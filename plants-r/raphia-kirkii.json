It is characterized by its tall, slender trunk and a crown of large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, clustered flowers followed by edible fruits that are consumed by both humans and animals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in swampy or marshy areas. Due to its striking appearance, it is popular in horticulture for ornamental purposes."
