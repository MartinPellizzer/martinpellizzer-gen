    "intro": "Rhinanthus minor var. stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom from June to August. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially depends on other plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in grasslands, woodland edges, and disturbed soils, often in sunny conditions. Its slender, lance-shaped leaves and showy inflorescences make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its habitat."
