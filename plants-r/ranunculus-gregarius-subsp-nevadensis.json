    "intro": "Ranunculus gregarius subsp. nevadensis, commonly known as the Sierra larkspur, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It is characterized by its delicate, blue to purple flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded areas such as meadows and forest floors. It has a fibrous root system and produces small, capsule-like fruits. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sensitive species in its native habitat."
