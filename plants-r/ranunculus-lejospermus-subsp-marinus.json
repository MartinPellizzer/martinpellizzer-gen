    "intro": "Ranunculus lejospermus subsp. marinus, commonly known as the coastal buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of southern South America. It typically grows in sandy or gravelly soils along the shoreline, where it is adapted to salt spray and fluctuating moisture levels. The plant features basal leaves with lobed margins and produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals. Its subspecific classification reflects its distinct ecological and morphological characteristics compared to other members of the species. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
