It features large, waxy leaves that can grow up to two meters in length, providing shade and habitat for various small organisms. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom throughout the wet season. Its root system is extensive, allowing it to absorb nutrients from deep within the soil. Due to its size and ecological importance, it plays a significant role in maintaining the biodiversity of its native ecosystem."
