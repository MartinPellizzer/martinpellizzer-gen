It thrives in saline and sandy soils, often found along shorelines and dunes. The plant has a low-growing, herbaceous habit with spiny leaves that help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Its flowers are typically arranged in dense, spike-like clusters, and it is known for its resilience to wind and salt spray. Reseda alba var. maritima plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal soils and providing habitat for various insects and birds."
