It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically red when ripe. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and along stream banks. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are often covered in fine hairs."
