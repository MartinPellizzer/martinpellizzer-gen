    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. scabrata, commonly known as the roughleaf dog\u73ab\u7470, is a hybrid shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dense foliage, with leaves that are rough to the touch due to their serrated edges. The plant produces showy pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer, which are typically borne in clusters. It is a hardy species that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rocky or alpine gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
