    "intro": "Rhamnus angulata, commonly known as the angular buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and is characterized by its angular, often thorned stems. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange-red berries in the fall. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rhamnus angulata is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological benefits."
