    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. lixionensis, commonly known as the Lixionensis Alpine Rose, is a variant of the alpine rose native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its compact growth and dense foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers during the summer months, typically in June and July. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white trichomes, which help reduce water loss in its arid habitat. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often found in rocky or alpine environments."
