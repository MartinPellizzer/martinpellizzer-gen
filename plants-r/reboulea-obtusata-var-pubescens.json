    "intro": "Reboulea obtusata var. pubescens, commonly known as the hairy redbud, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lanceolate leaves that are pubescent, or covered in fine hairs, giving it a distinctive texture. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant, white or pale pink flowers in early spring, which are followed by elongated, woody pods. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
