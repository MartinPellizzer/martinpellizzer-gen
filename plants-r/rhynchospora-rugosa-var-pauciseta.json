    "intro": "Rhynchospora rugosa var. pauciseta, commonly known as the rough spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, three-lobed flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color. This variety is distinguished by its reduced number of flowering branches compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora rugosa."
