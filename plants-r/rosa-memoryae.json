    "intro": "Rosa memoryae, commonly known as the Memory's Rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and a compact growth habit, making it suitable for small garden spaces. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, requiring consistent moisture during its growing season. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, Rosa memoryae is often cultivated for its aesthetic value and historical significance."
