    "intro": "Rumex acetosa proles papillaris, commonly known as sour dock or garden sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its distinctive arrow-shaped leaves with a wavy margin and a reddish or purplish coloration on the veins. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, which are typically arranged in spikes. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, along roadsides, and in cultivated gardens. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
