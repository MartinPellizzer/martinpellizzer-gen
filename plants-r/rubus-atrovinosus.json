    "intro": "Rubus atrovinosus, commonly known as blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its prickly nature, it is both a useful hedging plant and a challenge for land management."
