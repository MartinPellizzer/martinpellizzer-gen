    "intro": "Ruellia carnea, commonly known as red-veined ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its striking purple to violet flowers with contrasting red veins, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1 meter, and has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Ruellia carnea prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardens. Its rapid growth and ability to thrive in tropical and subtropical climates contribute to its widespread cultivation."
