    "intro": "Rosa aurelianensis, commonly known as the Aurelian rose, is a rare species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, yellowish-orange flowers. The plant has narrow, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, silvery hairs. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, thriving in cooler climates. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
