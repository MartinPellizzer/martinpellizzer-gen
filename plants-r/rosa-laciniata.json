    "intro": "Rosa laciniata, commonly known as the cutleaf rose, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern and central Europe. It is characterized by its deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that give it a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardens. Rosa laciniata is valued for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in temperate climates."
