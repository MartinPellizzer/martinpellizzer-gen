It is characterized by its upright growth habit and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in the summer months. It thrives in partial to full shade and well-drained soil, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
