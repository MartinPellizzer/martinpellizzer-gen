    "intro": "Ranunculus silerifolius var. glaber, commonly known as the glabrous buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a basal rosette of leaves that are typically simple and palmately lobed, with a smooth, hairless surface. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens and a central pistil. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
