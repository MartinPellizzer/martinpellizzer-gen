    "intro": "Rubus guentheri f. venosulus, commonly known as the veiny blackberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its distinctive venous patterns on the leaves, which set it apart from other blackberry species. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. This subspecies is valued for both its ornamental appeal and its use in local ecosystems."
