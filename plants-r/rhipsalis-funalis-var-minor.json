    "intro": "Rhipsalis funalis var. minor, commonly known as the miniature rhipsalis, is a compact, trailing cactus native to South America. It features delicate, soft green stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers during the winter months, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental appeal, it is often cultivated as a houseplant or in hanging baskets."
