    "intro": "Rhinanthus stenophyllus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved yellow-rush, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially depends on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are yellow and clustered in dense spikes, blooming from June to August. It is found primarily in southern and central Europe, with some populations in the British Isles."
