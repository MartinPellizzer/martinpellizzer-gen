    "intro": "Rhus microphylla, commonly known as the littleleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It is characterized by its finely divided, feathery leaves that give it a delicate appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clustered inflorescences, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Rhus microphylla thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and open areas. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various soil conditions."
