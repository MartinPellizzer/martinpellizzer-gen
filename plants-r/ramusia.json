    "intro": "Ramusia, commonly known as the \"scented fern,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araliaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, feathery foliage and small, clustered flowers that often emit a subtle fragrance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forests and rocky crevices. Its leaves are usually bipinnate, meaning they are divided into two sets of smaller leaflets. Ramusia species are valued for their ornamental appeal and are often cultivated in gardens for their aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
