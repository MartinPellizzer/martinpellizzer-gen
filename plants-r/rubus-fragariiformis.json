    "intro": "Rubus fragariiformis, commonly known as the trailing raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low shrubs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red but can also be yellow or orange. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a hairy surface. Rubus fragariiformis thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
