    "intro": "Risleya atropurpurea, commonly known as the purple leaf hibiscus, is a striking tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that display a rich purple hue on the underside, contrasting with its dark green upper surface. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of red, pink, and white, which bloom throughout the warmer months. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a houseplant."
