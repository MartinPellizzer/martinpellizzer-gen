    "intro": "Relhania faginea, commonly known as the African maple, is a deciduous tree native to southern Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its broad, palmate leaves that turn vibrant yellow in autumn. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, capsule-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in savanna and woodland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely known outside its native region."
