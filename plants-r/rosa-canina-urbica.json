    "intro": "Rosa canina urbica, commonly known as the urban dog rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa canina (dog rose) and Rosa rugosa (rough rose). It is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces red, hairy rosehips that contain high levels of vitamin C. It is often found growing in disturbed soils along roadsides, waste areas, and urban environments. Due to its adaptability, it is considered an invasive species in some regions."
