    "intro": "Rosa foetida f. persiana, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a fragrant, cold-hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of Iran and Central Asia. It produces clusters of small, pink to white flowers with a strong, sweet scent, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves and is characterized by its thorny stems. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in Persian gardens. Due to its delicate nature, it requires well-drained soil and protection from extreme weather conditions."
