It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that persist through winter. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens and erosion control."
