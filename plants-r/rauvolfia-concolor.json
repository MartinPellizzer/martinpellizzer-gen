    "intro": "Rauvolfia concolor, commonly known as Indian snakeroot, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows up to 3 meters in height, with opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in clusters, often white or pink, followed by capsule fruits containing several seeds. Its roots are the primary part used in traditional medicine and modern pharmacology due to their alkaloid content, particularly reserpine."
