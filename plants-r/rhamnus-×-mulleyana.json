    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 mulleyana, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its dark green, oval-shaped leaves and small, black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant is often found in moist to wet habitats, such as stream banks and wetlands, and can form dense thickets. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an invasive species in many regions, outcompeting native vegetation. The plant's botanical features include smooth, reddish bark and thornless stems, which distinguish it from its parent species."
