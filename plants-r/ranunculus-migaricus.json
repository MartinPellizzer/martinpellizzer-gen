    "intro": "Ranunculus migaricus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine meadows, where it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features a basal rosette of glossy, lobed leaves and produces showy yellow flowers with five petals. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, Ranunculus migaricus is considered a rare and sensitive species in many regions."
