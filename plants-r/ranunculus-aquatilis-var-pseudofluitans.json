    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. pseudofluitans, commonly known as the floating water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant characterized by its delicate, floating leaves and yellow flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The leaves are usually divided into fine, thread-like segments and form a floating mat on the water surface. The plant produces small, bright yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
