    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. brevifidus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves with a distinctive yellowish-green hue and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Its subspecies is distinguished by its shorter, narrower leaves compared to the typical form of R. auricomus. The flowers are typically less than 2 inches in diameter and have five to seven sepals that resemble petals."
