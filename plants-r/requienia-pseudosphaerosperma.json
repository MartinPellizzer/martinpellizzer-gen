    "intro": "Requienia pseudosphaerosperma, commonly known as the African sandalwood, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Burseraceae family and is characterized by its aromatic, fragrant wood that is highly valued for its scent and durability. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry woodland or savanna habitats. Due to overharvesting, it is considered vulnerable and requires conservation efforts to ensure its survival."
