    "intro": "Rubus rohlenae, commonly known as the Rohlen's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of central Mexico, where it thrives in rocky and well-drained soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and it has a shrub-like growth habit. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus rohlenae is considered a rare and endemic species."
