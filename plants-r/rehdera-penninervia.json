It is characterized by its simple, alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically red-veined and turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers in the spring, followed by red, berry-like fruits that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Rehdera penninervia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in supporting local wildlife."
