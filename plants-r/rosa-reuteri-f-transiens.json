    "intro": "Rosa reuteri f. transiens, commonly known as the Transient Rosa or the Transient Rock Rose, is a hybrid form of the Rosa reuteri species. It is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in Kazakhstan and the Tian Shan mountains. The plant is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens and alpine settings. Its ornamental value lies in its delicate pink to white flowers and its ability to bloom reliably under the right conditions."
