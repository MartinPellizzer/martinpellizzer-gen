    "intro": "Rubus costatus var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian bramble, is a variant of the evergreen bramble native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and glossy. The plant produces small, white flowers in clusters, followed by red, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in temperate rainforests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
