    "intro": "Rosa resinosa var. arenaria, commonly known as the sand rose, is a low-growing shrub native to the coastal regions of the southeastern United States. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in spring. The plant has a woody stem covered in a layer of resinous, sticky secretions, which gives it its scientific name. Its leaves are alternate and simple, with a grayish-green hue and a hairy texture. It thrives in sandy, well-drained soils and is adapted to coastal environments with salt spray and high winds."
