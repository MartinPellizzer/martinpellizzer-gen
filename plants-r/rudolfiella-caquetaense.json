It is native to the tropical regions of South America, particularly Colombia. The plant is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds that are typically light green in color. Rudolfiella caquetaense thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in humid forest understories. Its botanical features make it an interesting subject for studies on tropical plant morphology and ecological adaptation."
