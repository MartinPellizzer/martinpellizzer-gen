    "intro": "Ranunculus multiflorus, commonly known as the many-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with numerous petals that bloom in early spring. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and a hairy stem that grows up to 30 cm in height. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
