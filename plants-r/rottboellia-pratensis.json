    "intro": "Rottboellia pratensis, commonly known as purpletop grass, is a perennial grass native to warm temperate and tropical regions. It has slender, upright stems that often form dense clumps, and its leaves are narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences with purple or pink flowers, which bloom in summer. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, and it is often found in disturbed soils such as roadsides and fields. Rottboellia pratensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in erosion control."
