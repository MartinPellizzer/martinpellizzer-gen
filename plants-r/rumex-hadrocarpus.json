    "intro": "Rumex hadrocarpus, commonly known as the giant dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of southern Africa. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, often with a wavy or serrated margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on tall, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in marshy areas or along riverbanks. Due to its adaptability, it can sometimes become invasive in non-native environments."
