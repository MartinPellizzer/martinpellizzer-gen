    "intro": "Roegneria macerrima, commonly known as the rough fescue, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and stiff, rough-textured blades that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces spikelets that are often loosely arranged, with lemmas that have distinct keels and short hairs. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, pastures, and disturbed sites. Roegneria macerrima is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in ecological restoration projects."
