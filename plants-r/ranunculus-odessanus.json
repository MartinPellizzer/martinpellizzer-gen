    "intro": "Ranunculus odessanus, commonly known as the Odessa buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Caucasus region. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow flowers with a central cluster of stamens. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other herbaceous plants with similar floral structures. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
