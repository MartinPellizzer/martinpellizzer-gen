    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 dimidiatus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological traits. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish or purple underside, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth form and leaf characteristics."
