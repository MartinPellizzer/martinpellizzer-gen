    "intro": "Roystonea regia, commonly known as the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, feather-like leaves that can reach up to 5 meters in length. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that develop into small, round fruits containing a single black seed. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a symbol of elegance. The royal palm is also valued for its ability to provide shade and its use in traditional medicine."
