    "intro": "Rosa stohlii, commonly known as the Stohlii rose, is a species native to the high-altitude regions of South America, particularly in the Andes. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, thorny stems. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is well adapted to cool, dry climates. Rosa stohlii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
