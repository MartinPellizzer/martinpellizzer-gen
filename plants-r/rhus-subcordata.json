    "intro": "Rhus subcordata, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are a source of food for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woodlands. Rhus subcordata is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
