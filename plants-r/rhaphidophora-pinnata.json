    "intro": "Rhaphidophora pinnata, commonly known as the Zebra Plant, is a tropical fern native to Southeast Asia. It features distinctive, deeply pinnately divided leaves that give it a striking, feathery appearance. The plant produces small, spore-bearing structures called sori, which are typically located on the underside of the fronds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant. Its foliage is characterized by a unique pattern of light and dark green, resembling a zebra's stripes."
