    "intro": "Rosa cerasifera, commonly known as the cherry laurel rose, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, glossy leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces red, berry-like fruits that are edible but often have a bitter taste. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in landscaping for its dense growth habit. However, it can be invasive in some regions and may cause skin irritation due to its sharp thorns."
