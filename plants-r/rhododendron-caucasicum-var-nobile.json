    "intro": "Rhododendron caucasicum var. nobile, commonly known as the Caucasian noble rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, funnel-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, often with a white throat, during late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
