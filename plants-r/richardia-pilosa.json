    "intro": "Richardia pilosa, commonly known as the hairy grass or rough hairgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and hairy leaves that give it its common name. The plant typically grows in moist soils, often in wetlands or along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a spike-like cluster of small, pale green to brownish flowers. Richardia pilosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
