    "intro": "Ranunculus vestitus, commonly known as the hairy buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of about 15 to 30 centimeters, featuring a basal rosette of dark green, hairy leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to nine petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs, giving the plant its common name. Ranunculus vestitus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and rocky habitats."
