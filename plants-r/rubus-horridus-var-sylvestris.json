    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. sylvestris, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a thorny shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has serrated leaves and is characterized by its dense, bramble-like growth habit. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions. The berries are often used in jams and wines, though they are generally less flavorful than other blackberry varieties."
