    "intro": "Rebutia krainziana var. wessneriana, commonly known as the Wessner's Rebutia, is a compact cactus native to South America, specifically Bolivia. It features a globular to cylindrical stem with a smooth, pale green to bluish-gray surface. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens and requires well-draining soil and full sun exposure. Due to its slow growth and ornamental value, it is a popular choice among cactus enthusiasts."
