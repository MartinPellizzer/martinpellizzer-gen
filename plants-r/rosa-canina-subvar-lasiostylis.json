    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. lasiostylis, commonly known as the hairy-styled dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from other varieties of Rosa canina. The flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals and a distinctive, hairy style that gives it its common name. This plant produces small, red berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and scrublands."
