    "intro": "Rumex scutatus subsp. glaucus, commonly known as the glaucous dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its basal rosette of broad, waxy, and often bluish-green leaves. The plant produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. Its leaves are typically covered with a fine, powdery coating, giving them a distinctive glaucous appearance. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
