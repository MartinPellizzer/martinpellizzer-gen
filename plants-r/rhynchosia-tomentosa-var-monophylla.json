    "intro": "Rhynchosia tomentosa var. monophylla, commonly known as the woolly cowpea, is a tropical legume native to parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, ovate leaves and clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces cylindrical, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often used as a forage crop or for soil enrichment due to its nitrogen-fixing ability. Its ornamental value also makes it a popular choice for garden cultivation."
