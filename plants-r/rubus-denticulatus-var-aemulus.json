    "intro": "Rubus denticulatus var. aemulus, commonly known as the sharp-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its finely toothed leaves and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, woodland environments and thrives in partial to full shade. Its thorny stems and clustered growth habit make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus. The berries are often used in culinary applications despite their tart flavor."
