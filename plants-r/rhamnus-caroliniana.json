    "intro": "Rhamnus caroliniana, commonly known as the Carolina buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and has smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. Its leaves are alternate, oval-shaped, and have a serrated edge, often turning red in the fall. The species is adapted to moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks."
