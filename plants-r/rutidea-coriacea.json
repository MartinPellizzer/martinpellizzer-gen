It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant has woody stems covered in a thick, rough bark, giving it its scientific name \"coriacea,\" meaning \"rough\" in Latin. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and it produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink or white. Rutidea coriacea is often found in dry forest and savanna habitats, where it plays a role in soil stabilization and provides habitat for various insects and birds."
