    "intro": "Rhynchospora amazonica subsp. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and seasonally flooded areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has slender, grass-like stems and produces small, clustered inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. Its leaves are narrow and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its humid environment. This subspecies is part of the Cyperaceae family, which includes many other sedges and related plants."
