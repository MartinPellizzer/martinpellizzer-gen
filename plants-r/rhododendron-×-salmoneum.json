    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 salmoneum, commonly known as the salmon rhododendron, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron maximum. It is characterized by its striking salmon-pink to reddish flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is evergreen, with dense, leathery foliage that provides year-round structure. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it both ornamental and ecologically valuable in native habitats."
