    "intro": "Rumex dictyocarpus, commonly known as the broad-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, and its stems are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on short, erect pedicels. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, giving them a tart, sour flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas."
