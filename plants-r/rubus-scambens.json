    "intro": "Rubus scambens, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or black in color. Its stems are covered in fine, erect hairs and can spread along the ground through stolons. The botanical characteristics of Rubus scambens make it an important component of understory plant communities in its native habitat."
