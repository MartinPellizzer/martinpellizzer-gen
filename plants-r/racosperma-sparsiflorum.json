    "intro": "Racosperma sparsiflorum, commonly known as the sparse-flowered acacia, is a shrub or small tree native to Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and bipinnate leaves that are finely divided. The plant produces yellow or pale yellow flowers in compact, globular inflorescences, which bloom during the warmer months. Its seeds are encased in pods that split open when mature, releasing small, hard seeds. Racosperma sparsiflorum is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient component of native Australian flora."
