    "intro": "Ranunculus paludosus var. flabellatus, commonly known as the flabellate water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, trifoliate leaves that are often submerged or floating on water surfaces. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in shallow, still or slow-moving waters, often forming dense mats that help stabilize aquatic environments. Due to its preference for moist conditions, it is often found in marshes, pond margins, and along the edges of streams."
