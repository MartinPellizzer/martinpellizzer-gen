    "intro": "Ranunculus kykkoensis, commonly known as the Kyrgyz mountain buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or white flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces a distinctive, short stem with a basal rosette of leaves. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
