    "intro": "Rumex obtusifolius subsp. sylvestris, commonly known as woodland sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features upright stems that bear heart-shaped, glossy leaves with a waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a sour, tangy flavor due to the presence of oxalic acid."
