It features delicate, heart-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface, with roots submerged in the water. The plant typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats. It is often used in aquascaping due to its aesthetic appeal and ability to provide shelter for aquatic life. Rotala repens thrives in warm water conditions and requires moderate to high light for optimal growth."
