    "intro": "Retama microcarpa, commonly known as the small-fruited broom, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its small, yellowish flowers and narrow, leathery leaves. The plant produces small, woody pods that contain several seeds. Retama microcarpa is adapted to dry, rocky soils and is often found in coastal and inland areas. It plays a role in preventing soil erosion due to its extensive root system."
