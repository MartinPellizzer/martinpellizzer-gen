    "intro": "Rubus insolatus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to regions of eastern Asia, including China, Japan, and Korea. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The berries are typically edible, though they are often tart and used in jams or wines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its fruit."
