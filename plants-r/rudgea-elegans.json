    "intro": "Rudgea elegans, commonly known as the elegant rudgea, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink to purple, attracting pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. The plant features a woody stem with smooth, glossy leaves that are often lance-shaped and arranged alternately along the stem. Rudgea elegans thrives in warm, humid environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for gardens and botanical collections."
