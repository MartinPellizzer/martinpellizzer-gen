    "intro": "Ranunculus isthmicus subsp. tenuifolius, commonly known as the slender-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Mediterranean region. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils along stream banks and rocky areas. Its flowers are short-lived, often lasting only a day, and it is known for its ornamental value in gardens. The subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus isthmicus."
