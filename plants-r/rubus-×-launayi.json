    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 launayi, commonly known as the Launay blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (slippery elm) and Rubus gebleri (blackberry). It is a thorny shrub that typically grows in temperate climates, featuring dark green leaves and clusters of white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in culinary applications. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a mix of traits from both parent species, making it a subject of interest in horticulture and botany."
