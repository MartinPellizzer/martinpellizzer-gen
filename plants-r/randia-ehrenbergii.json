    "intro": "Randia ehrenbergii, commonly known as the redroot sandmat, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows in sandy or rocky soils, often in coastal areas. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, white to pale pink flowers clustered in umbels. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Randia ehrenbergii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its compact growth and seasonal blooms."
