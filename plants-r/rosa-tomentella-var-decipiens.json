    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. decipiens, commonly known as the woolly rose or the deceptive rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a fine, white pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. While not widely cultivated, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and ecological adaptations."
