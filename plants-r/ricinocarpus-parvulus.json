    "intro": "Ricinocarpus parvulus, commonly known as the small-leafed ricin tree, is a small evergreen shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical in shape and have a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by capsule fruits containing minute, black seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it is occasionally cultivated in horticultural settings."
