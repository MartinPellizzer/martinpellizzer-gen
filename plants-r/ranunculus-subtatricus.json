    "intro": "Ranunculus subtatricus, commonly known as the Subtatrionic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, preferring well-drained, rocky soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive hairy texture. It blooms from late spring to early summer, and its flowers are often visited by pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
