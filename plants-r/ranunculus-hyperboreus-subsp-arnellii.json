It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are adapted to cold climates. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tundra and rocky habitats. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
