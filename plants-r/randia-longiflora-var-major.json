    "intro": "Randia longiflora var. major, commonly known as the large-flowered randia, is a tropical shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its aromatic, glandular leaves and clusters of small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom throughout the year. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, containing several seeds. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas and lowland forests. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in subtropical gardens for its foliage and flowering display."
