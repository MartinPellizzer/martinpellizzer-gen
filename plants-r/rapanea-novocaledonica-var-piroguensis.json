    "intro": "Rapanea novocaledonica var. piroguensis, commonly known as the Piroguensian boxwood, is a rare evergreen shrub native to New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels and bay trees, and is characterized by its dense, compact growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves that are glossy and dark green, with a leathery texture. It produces small, fragrant flowers followed by edible berries that are an important food source for local wildlife. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
