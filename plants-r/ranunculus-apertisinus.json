    "intro": "Ranunculus apertisinus, commonly known as the open-faced buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows to a height of about 30 cm and thrives in well-drained, moist soils. It blooms from late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
