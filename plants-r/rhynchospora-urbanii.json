    "intro": "Rhynchospora urbanii, commonly known as the urban marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets. Its inflorescence is usually clustered at the top of the stem, and it blooms during the late spring to early summer months. Rhynchospora urbanii plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
