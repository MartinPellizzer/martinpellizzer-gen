    "intro": "Reseda aucheri subsp. aucheri, commonly known as the alpine lady's mantle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its basal rosette of silver-white, woolly leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring to early summer, which are clustered in dense, spherical inflorescences. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its attractive foliage and ability to attract pollinators."
