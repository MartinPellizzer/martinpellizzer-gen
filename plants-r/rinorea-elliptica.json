    "intro": "Rinorea elliptica, commonly known as the velvetleaf or velvetleaf tree, is a tropical shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its simple, elliptic leaves that are usually covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by capsule fruits containing numerous seeds. Rinorea elliptica is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. It has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic properties."
