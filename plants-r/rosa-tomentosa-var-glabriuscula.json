    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. glabriuscula, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are compound, with ovate to elliptical leaflets that are covered in a fine, silvery down, though the variety 'glabriuscula' has a reduced amount of this pubescence. The plant prefers partial shade to full sun and well-drained soil, often growing in moist woodland habitats. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
