    "intro": "Rhynchospora velutina var. glabrescens, commonly known as the smooth swamp cordgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds and lakes. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are usually smooth and hairless, especially in the mature stages. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, three-parted flowers. This variety is distinguished by its reduced hairy covering compared to the typical form, giving it a smoother appearance."
