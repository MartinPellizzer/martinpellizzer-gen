    "intro": "Rubia tenuifolia var. brachypoda, commonly known as narrowleaf bedstraw, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant features slender, ascending stems with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its small, yellowish-white flowers are clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is characterized by its shorter stature and narrower leaves compared to the typical form of Rubia tenuifolia."
