    "intro": "Ritchiea langii, commonly known as the Lang's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and produces cones for reproduction. Ritchiea langii is listed as endangered due to habitat loss and over-collection, making it a subject of conservation efforts. Its botanical study provides insights into the evolutionary history of cycads and their ecological significance in tropical ecosystems."
