    "intro": "Romanschulzia costaricensis, commonly known as the Costa Rican orchid, is a tropical plant native to Central America, particularly Costa Rica. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, fragrant flowers that bloom in a variety of colors, including white, yellow, and pink. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, often in forest understories where it relies on mycorrhizal associations for nutrient uptake. Its unique floral structure and pollination mechanisms make it an important species in the ecological dynamics of its native habitat."
