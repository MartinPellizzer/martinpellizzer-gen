It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas or along stream banks. Rubus howii is valued for its ornamental value and its role in supporting local wildlife."
