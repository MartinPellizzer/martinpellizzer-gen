    "intro": "Ranunculus micronivalis var. platypetalus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its small, bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in rocky, alpine meadows where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it has a short, herbaceous stem. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a vulnerable species."
