    "intro": "Rosa gebleriana var. puberula, commonly known as the hairy rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The leaves are typically covered in fine, soft hairs, giving the plant its \"hairy\" appearance. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or limestone habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardiness and resilience."
