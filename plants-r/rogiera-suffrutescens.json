    "intro": "Rogiera suffrutescens, commonly known as the silverleaf rogeria, is a small shrub native to South America. It is characterized by its compact, evergreen foliage that is densely covered with silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, tubular flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in the spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is not widely distributed outside its native range."
