    "intro": "Renantherella histrionica subsp. auyongii, commonly known as the Auyong's flame orchid, is a rare and striking orchid native to the Philippines. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange inflorescences, which are highly ornamental and attract attention. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded forest environments, often on tree trunks or branches. Its flowers are relatively short-lived but emit a strong, sweet fragrance, which aids in pollination by insects. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species requiring conservation efforts."
