    "intro": "Rhus synstylica, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that develop into red, fuzzy berries in the fall. Its bark is thick and scaly, giving it a rugged appearance, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rhus synstylica is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and is also known for its medicinal properties in traditional herbal remedies."
