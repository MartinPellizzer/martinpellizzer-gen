    "intro": "Rhus fruticosa, commonly known as the smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and features compound leaves with 15 to 30 leaflets that turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, which are followed by clusters of red, fuzzy fruits that persist through winter. Rhus fruticosa thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types, including sandy and clay soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to attract wildlife."
