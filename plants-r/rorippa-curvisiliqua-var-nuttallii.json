    "intro": "Rorippa curvisiliqua var. nuttallii, commonly known as Nuttall's watercress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in wet or moist environments such as stream banks, marshes, and along the edges of ponds. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, and it produces small, white or yellowish flowers arranged in clusters. Its reproductive strategy involves wind pollination, and it is often found in nutrient-rich aquatic habitats. This variety is closely related to other members of the Brassicaceae family, sharing similar structural and biochemical characteristics."
