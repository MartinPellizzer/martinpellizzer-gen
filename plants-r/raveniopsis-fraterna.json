It is characterized by its silvery, velvety foliage that reflects sunlight, helping it to conserve moisture in harsh environments. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink and purple, which bloom during the cooler months. It is a member of the Malvaceae family, sharing botanical traits with other members such as hibiscus and cotton. Due to its unique appearance and adaptability, it is often cultivated in xeriscapes and rock gardens."
