    "intro": "Rosa rambertiae, commonly known as the Rambert rose, is a species of flowering plant native to New Zealand. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom in late winter to early spring. Rosa rambertiae is well adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native habitat and is often found in forested areas. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and valuable component of New Zealand's native flora."
