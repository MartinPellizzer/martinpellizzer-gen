    "intro": "Rubus pseudoapetalus, commonly known as the false thimbleberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, pale yellow flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, though they are less commonly consumed than other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are oval and serrated. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
