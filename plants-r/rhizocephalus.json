    "intro": "Rhizocephalus, commonly known as the parasitic barnacle, is a genus of marine crustaceans that exhibit unique botanical-like characteristics due to their parasitic lifestyle. These organisms lack the typical barnacle shell and instead develop a complex, root-like structure called a \"haustellum\" to infiltrate and feed on their host. The haustellum is composed of specialized cells that absorb nutrients from the host's tissues, often leading to the host's eventual death. Rhizocephalus primarily infects crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters, forming a symbiotic relationship that is more parasitic than mutualistic. Their life cycle involves free-swimming larvae that seek out and attach to a suitable host, marking the beginning of their parasitic development."
