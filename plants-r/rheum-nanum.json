    "intro": "Rheum nanum, commonly known as narrowleaf rhubarb, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features tall, upright stems with broad, heart-shaped leaves that are deeply veined and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-white flowers in early summer, which are followed by reddish-brown seeds. Its rhubarb-like leaves are edible but are typically used in ornamental gardening rather than culinary purposes. The plant is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in poor soil conditions."
