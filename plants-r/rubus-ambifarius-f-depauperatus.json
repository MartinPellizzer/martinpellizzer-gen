    "intro": "Rubus ambifarius f. depauperatus, commonly known as the sparse-fruited blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant native to the western United States. It is characterized by its reduced floral structures and smaller, less robust fruits compared to the typical Rubus ambifarius. The plant exhibits thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually pink to white, and it produces edible berries, though they are often less flavorful than those of other blackberry species. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for hybridization with other Rubus species."
