    "intro": "Rubia brachypoda, commonly known as the short-stemmed bedstraw, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes many species of flowering plants. The plant has slender, prostrate stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. Its small, white or pinkish flowers are clustered in cymes and bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its characteristic appearance."
