    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus f. nemorensis, commonly known as the forest buttercup, is a botanical variant of the common buttercup. It is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. This subspecies is native to forested regions of Central and Eastern Europe, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant has hairy stems and leaves, which help it retain moisture in its woodland habitat. Its presence is often an indicator of undisturbed, nutrient-rich soils in forest ecosystems."
