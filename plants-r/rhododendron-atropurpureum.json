    "intro": "Rhododendron atropurpureum, commonly known as the purple-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage that turns a striking purple or reddish hue in the autumn. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist climates with well-drained acidic soil. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
