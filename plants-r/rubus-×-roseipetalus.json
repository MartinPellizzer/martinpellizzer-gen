This hybrid plant is a cross between Rubus idaeus (red raspberry) and Rubus pendulus (blackberry), resulting in a unique combination of traits. It produces small, pinkish-red berries that are typically smaller than regular raspberries. The plant has thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and edible fruits."
