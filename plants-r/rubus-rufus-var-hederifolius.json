    "intro": "Rubus rufus var. hederifolius, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, thorny stems that root at the nodes. The leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually hairy and have a slightly serrated edge. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as raspberries, which are typically red when ripe. This plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or along stream banks."
