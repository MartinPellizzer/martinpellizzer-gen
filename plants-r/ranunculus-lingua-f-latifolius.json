It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is native to parts of Europe and Asia. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typical of the genus Ranunculus. Its foliage is often more substantial and broader than that of the typical species, giving it a distinct appearance. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges."
