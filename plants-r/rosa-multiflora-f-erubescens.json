It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn a striking red or reddish-purple in the fall. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is particularly notable for its vibrant autumn coloration, making it a popular ornamental plant. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and as a hedge due to its dense growth habit."
