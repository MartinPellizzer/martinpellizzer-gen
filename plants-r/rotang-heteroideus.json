    "intro": "Rotang heteroideus, commonly known as the African shea tree, is a tropical tree native to central and western Africa. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves and produces small, yellowish flowers that are followed by edible fruits. The tree is valued for its timber, which is used in furniture and construction, and for its seeds, which yield shea butter. It thrives in moist, tropical climates and is often found in savanna and forest edge habitats. The plant plays an important role in both ecological and economic systems in its native regions."
