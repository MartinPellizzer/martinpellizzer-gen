    "intro": "Roscoea tibetica f. alba, commonly known as the white-flowered roscoea, is a rare and striking plant native to the high altitudes of the Tibetan Plateau. It belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, which includes gingers, and is characterized by its ornamental, showy inflorescences. The plant features broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. Its flowers, which are predominantly white with a hint of pink, bloom in late summer and are highly prized by horticulturists for their beauty. Due to its limited natural range and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging but rewarding plant to cultivate."
