    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. horridifactus, commonly known as the spiked blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its dense, thorny growth. It produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its foliage is covered in fine hairs, giving it a rough texture. This variety is valued for its hardiness and unique appearance, though its thorns make it less suitable for cultivation in residential areas."
