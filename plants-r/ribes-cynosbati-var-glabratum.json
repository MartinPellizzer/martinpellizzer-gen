It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its alternate, simple, and often pubescent leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, round berries that mature to a dark red or black color. Its berries are used in culinary applications and have a tart flavor, making it a valuable plant for both ornamental and edible purposes. The smooth gooseberry is also notable for its adaptability to various soil types and its ability to thrive in partial shade."
