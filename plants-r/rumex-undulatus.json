    "intro": "Rumex undulatus, commonly known as the wavy sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like buckwheat and sorrel. The plant features alternate, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive wavy margin, and it produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, so they should be consumed in moderation."
