    "intro": "Rostraria phleoides, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rostraria, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern China. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white flowers arranged in umbels, which bloom in early spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in shaded forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
