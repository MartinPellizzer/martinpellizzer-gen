    "intro": "Rhynchospora luzuliformis var. pusilla, commonly known as the dwarf bluejoint grass, is a small perennial herb native to North America. It typically grows in wetland habitats such as marshes and bogs, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are often blue-green in color, and it produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny white or pale blue flowers. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in dense stands. This variant is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora luzuliformis."
