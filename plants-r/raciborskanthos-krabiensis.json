    "intro": "Raciborskanthos krabiensis, commonly known as the Krabi orchid, is a rare and unique orchid species native to the coastal regions of southern Thailand. It is characterized by its striking, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in shades of white and pink, with intricate patterns on the petals. The plant thrives in humid, tropical environments and is often found in limestone hills and coastal forests. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture from the rocky substrates where it grows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
