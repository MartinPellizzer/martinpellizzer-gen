    "intro": "Rubus chlorostachys var. cannabifolius, commonly known as the green-stemmed blackberry variant with cannabis-like leaves, is a rare and unique subspecies of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its distinctive green stems and broad, serrated leaves that resemble those of Cannabis sativa. This plant is native to specific regions in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it produces small, dark berries similar to other Rubus species. Due to its genetic similarities to Cannabis, it has attracted interest in both botanical research and horticultural cultivation."
