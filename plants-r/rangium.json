    "intro": "Rangium, commonly known as the ghost flower, is a unique genus of flowering plants native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bioluminescent flowers that emit a faint glow at night, a feature that sets it apart from most other plants. The flowers are typically small and delicate, with intricate patterns that resemble ghostly apparitions, hence its common name. Rangium plants thrive in humid, shaded environments and require specific soil conditions to flourish. Due to its rarity and unique properties, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
