    "intro": "Rubus rusticanus var. tiliifolius, commonly known as the tiliifolius raspberry, is a shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its biennial growth habit, with the first year producing only leaves and the second year bearing flowers and fruit. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as raspberries, which are typically red and edible. Its leaves are trifoliate, with the terminal leaflet being notably larger and resembling the leaves of the tiliaceous plants, hence its varietal name. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats."
