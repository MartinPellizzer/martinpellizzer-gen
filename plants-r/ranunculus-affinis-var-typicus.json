It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by a cluster of golden stamens. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with palmate leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The species is noted for its rapid growth and ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a common weed in disturbed habitats."
