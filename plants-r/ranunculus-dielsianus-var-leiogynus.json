    "intro": "Ranunculus dielsianus var. leiogynus, commonly known as the smoothleaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to specific regions of South America. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy center, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its natural habitat. This variant is distinguished by its smooth, leathery leaves compared to other varieties in the species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
