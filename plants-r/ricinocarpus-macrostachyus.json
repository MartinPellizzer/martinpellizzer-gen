    "intro": "Ricinocarpus macrostachyus, commonly known as the giant sago palm, is a large cycad-like plant native to tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, pinnate leaves that can reach several meters in length. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense, spike-like inflorescences. Its seeds are encased in a hard, woody fruit and contain a toxic, protein-rich substance called cycasin. Due to its slow growth and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
