    "intro": "Rosa montana f. cuneata, commonly known as the Cuneata Rose, is a compact shrub with upright growth habit and dark green foliage. It produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is characterized by its narrow, elongated leaves, which give it the 'cuneata' designation, meaning wedge-shaped. It is a hardy variety, suitable for USDA hardiness zones 5 through 8, and thrives in full sun to partial shade. This rose is often used in gardens for its ornamental value and moderate maintenance requirements."
