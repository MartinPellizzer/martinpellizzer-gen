    "intro": "Rottboellia hispida, commonly known as the hairy panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It is characterized by its dense, tufted growth habit and narrow, hairy leaves that give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Rottboellia hispida is also known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in agricultural and natural settings."
