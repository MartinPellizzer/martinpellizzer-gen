    "intro": "Rumex vesicarius var. rubellianus, commonly known as the red-stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features dark green, heart-shaped leaves with a reddish tint on the underside, and it produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities. The species is notable for its distinctive reddish stems and its role in traditional herbal medicine."
