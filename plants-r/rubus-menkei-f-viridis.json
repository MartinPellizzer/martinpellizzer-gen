    "intro": "Rubus menkei f. viridis, commonly known as the green-fruited raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to the mountainous regions of China. This plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the fruit is a aggregate of small drupes, which are usually green in color, hence the common name. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or forested areas. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its fruit."
