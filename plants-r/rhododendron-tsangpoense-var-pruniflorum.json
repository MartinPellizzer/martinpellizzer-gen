    "intro": "Rhododendron tsangpoense var. pruniflorum, commonly known as the Tsangpo River rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the eastern Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded forest environments at high altitudes. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant floral display. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
