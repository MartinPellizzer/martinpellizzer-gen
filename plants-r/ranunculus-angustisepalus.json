    "intro": "Ranunculus angustisepalus, commonly known as the narrow-lobed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are often hairy and have a distinctive, serrated edge. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
