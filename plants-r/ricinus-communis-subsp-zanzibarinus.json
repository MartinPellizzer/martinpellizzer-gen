It is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and spiny calyces. The plant produces large, showy red or orange flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and birds. Its seeds contain a toxic oil, making it both a valuable and potentially hazardous species. Due to its ornamental appeal and ecological role, it is cultivated in gardens and natural habitats across its native range."
