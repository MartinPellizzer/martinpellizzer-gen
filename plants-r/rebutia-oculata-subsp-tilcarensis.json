It features short, cylindrical stems that are often ribbed and covered in white to pale green spines. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers that bloom in spring, adding ornamental value. It is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water. Its slow growth rate makes it a popular choice for rock gardens and container cultivation."
