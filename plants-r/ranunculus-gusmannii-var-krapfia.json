    "intro": "Ranunculus gusmannii var. krapfia, commonly known as the Krapf's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
