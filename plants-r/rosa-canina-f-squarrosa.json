It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and leaves, which give it a unique appearance compared to the typical rose. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with five petals and a fragrant scent. This form is often found in open woodland and scrubland habitats across Europe. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and has been cultivated for its hardy nature and historical significance in herbal medicine."
