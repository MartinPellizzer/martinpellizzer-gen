    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. acuminatifrons, commonly known as the sharp-fruited bramble, is a variant of the common bramble, characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with acuminate tips. It is native to Europe and parts of western Asia, often found in woodlands and along hedgerows. The plant produces small, white flowers in late spring, followed by aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It is a dioecious species, meaning separate male and female plants are required for fruit production. Its foliage and fruits are sometimes used in traditional herbal remedies."
