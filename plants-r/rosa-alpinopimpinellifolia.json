    "intro": "Rosa alpinopimpinellifolia, commonly known as the alpine rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with small, dark green leaves that are covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is adapted to cold, alpine climates. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
