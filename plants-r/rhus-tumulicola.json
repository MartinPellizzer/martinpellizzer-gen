    "intro": "Rhus tumulicola, commonly known as the Florida holly or swamp holly, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter green underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus tumulicola thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, swamps, and along stream banks. Its adaptability to wet environments makes it a valuable component of riparian ecosystems."
