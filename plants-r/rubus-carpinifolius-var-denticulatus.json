    "intro": "Rubus carpinifolius var. denticulatus, commonly known as the serrated bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia. It features prickly stems and compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black in color. It thrives in woodland edges and moist soils, often forming dense thickets. Its botanical characteristics make it both ecologically significant and a challenge for land management."
