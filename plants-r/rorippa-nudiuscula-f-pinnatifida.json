The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are arranged in racemes, typical of the Brassicaceae family. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. This subspecies is valued for its peppery flavor and is sometimes cultivated for culinary use."
