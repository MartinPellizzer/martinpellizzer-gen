It typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during the spring and early summer. Rustia angustifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
