    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicus subsp. kemerovensis, commonly known as the Kemerovo buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the Russian Far East and parts of Siberia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and mountain meadows. The plant features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, characteristic of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in its cool, humid habitat. This subspecies is notable for its limited distribution and is considered a rare and endemic species in its range."
