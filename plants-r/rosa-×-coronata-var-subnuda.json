    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 coronata var. subnuda, commonly known as the naked-stemmed hybrid rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its slender, often thornless stems and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, with simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape and have a soft, velvety texture. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, and the plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to various soil types. It prefers full sun to partial shade and is relatively drought-tolerant once established."
