    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. halophilus, commonly known as the coastal yellow rattle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. The plant thrives in sandy or gravelly soils, often found in dunes and coastal grasslands. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its ecological role includes supporting pollinators and contributing to the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems."
