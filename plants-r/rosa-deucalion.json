    "intro": "Rosa deucalion, commonly known as the \"Daucalion rose,\" is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant. It is characterized by its delicate pink or white petals and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. This plant is native to the mountainous regions of the Balkans and is often found in rocky, well-drained soils. Its botanical name honors Deucalion, a figure from Greek mythology, and it is prized for its ornamental value. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
