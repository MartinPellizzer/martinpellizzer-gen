    "intro": "Rosa glauca subvar. delasoieri, commonly known as the Delasoi rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, pale blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are typically narrow and have a slightly hairy surface, which helps reduce water loss in arid environments. This subvariety is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine habitats. Its ornamental value is complemented by its resilience to harsh climatic conditions."
