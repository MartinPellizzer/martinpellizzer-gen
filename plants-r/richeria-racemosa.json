    "intro": "Richeria racemosa, commonly known as the featherleaf richeria, is a tropical shrub native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, feather-like leaves that are arranged in whorls along the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in racemes, which bloom during the rainy season. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for horticultural cultivation in warm climates."
