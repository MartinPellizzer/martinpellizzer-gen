    "intro": "Rhodamnia tessellata, commonly known as the tessellated rock fig, is a flowering plant native to the eastern regions of Australia. It is a small shrub characterized by its dense, compact growth habit and its ability to thrive in rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible, fleshy fruits. Its leaves are usually opposite, ovate, and have a rough texture with a distinctive, almost tessellated pattern on the upper surface. Rhodamnia tessellata is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
