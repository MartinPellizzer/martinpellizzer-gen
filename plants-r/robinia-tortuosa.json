    "intro": "Robinia tortuosa, commonly known as the false acacia or yellowwood, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive, zigzag pattern. The tree produces fragrant, yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by long, flat pods that contain several seeds. Its bark is thick, fissured, and often has a reddish-brown color. Robinia tortuosa is known for its hard, heavy wood, which is resistant to decay and was historically used for shipbuilding and furniture."
