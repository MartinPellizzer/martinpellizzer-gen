    "intro": "Ranunculus sardous var. parvulus, commonly known as the dwarf meadow buttercup, is a small perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of southern Europe. It typically grows in moist meadows and grasslands, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture that helps reduce water loss. This variety is noted for its compact size and is often used in ornamental gardening for its delicate appearance."
