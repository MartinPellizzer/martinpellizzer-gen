    "intro": "Rhodax chamaecistus, commonly known as the rock rose, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is a low-growing shrub that typically reaches heights of about 30 centimeters. The plant produces clusters of small, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, depending on the variety. Its leaves are usually small, leathery, and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rhodax chamaecistus is often found in rocky soils and is well adapted to dry, sunny environments."
