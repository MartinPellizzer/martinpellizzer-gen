    "intro": "Rebutia borealis, commonly known as the Arctic Rebutia, is a low-growing succulent native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It features compact, rounded stems that are often covered in a fine, white powdery coating, known as farina. The plant produces small, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow, or white during the summer months. It is adapted to harsh, cold climates and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Rebutia borealis is an excellent choice for rock gardens and containers, thriving in full sun to partial shade."
