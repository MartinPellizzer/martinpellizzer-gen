    "intro": "Rhododendron apodectum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features dense, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense thickets, providing both aesthetic and ecological benefits."
