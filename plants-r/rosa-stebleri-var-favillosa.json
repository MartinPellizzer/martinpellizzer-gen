    "intro": "Rosa stebleri var. favillosa, commonly known as the favillosa rose, is a rare and ornamental species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of woolly hairs. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and delicate nature, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and specialized horticultural collections."
