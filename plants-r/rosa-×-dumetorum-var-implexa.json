    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. implexa, commonly known as the creeping rose, is a low-growing shrub characterized by its dense, mat-forming growth habit. It features small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, trifoliate leaves and produces red-orange hips that are edible but often used for ornamental purposes. It is native to Europe and thrives in well-drained soils in full sun to partial shade. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to form thick ground cover, making it suitable for erosion control and garden borders."
