    "intro": "Rosa canina f. argoviensis, commonly known as the Argovian dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinct morphological features. It is native to the Swiss Alps and surrounding regions, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant typically produces pale pink to white flowers with a subtle fragrance, and its hips are smaller and more elongated compared to the typical form. It is a shrub that can reach heights of up to 2 meters, with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude environments."
