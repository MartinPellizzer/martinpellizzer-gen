    "intro": "Rhamnus nelsonii, commonly known as Nelson's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in chaparral and woodland habitats. The plant has small, oval-shaped leaves that are usually dark green on top and lighter on the underside. Its flowers are clustered and appear in early spring, followed by small, black berries that are edible for some wildlife. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and the plant is known for its hardiness in arid environments."
