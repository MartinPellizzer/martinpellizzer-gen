It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The fruit is edible, though typically less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
