It is characterized by its tall, erect stems that are often covered with a distinctive waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are large, heart-shaped, and have a rough texture. Rubia pterygocaulis is often found in woodland areas and along stream banks, where it thrives in moist, shaded conditions."
