    "intro": "Rhamnoluma novocaledonica, commonly known as the New Caledonian hakea, is a shrub native to the tropical rainforests of New Caledonia. It belongs to the family Proteaceae and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and distinctive inflorescences. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, cone-like fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the unique ecological conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
