    "intro": "Ritchiea insculpta, commonly known as the sculpted cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the island of New Guinea. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive, rugged trunk and fern-like leaves. The plant produces cones instead of flowers, a feature typical of cycads, and it has a slow growth rate. Ritchiea insculpta is adapted to tropical and subtropical climates, thriving in well-drained soils and full sunlight. Due to its rarity and ecological significance, it is considered a conservation concern."
