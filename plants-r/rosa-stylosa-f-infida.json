    "intro": "Rosa stylosa f. infida, commonly known as the infertile form of the slender rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its reduced flowering and sterile characteristics. This form exhibits a compact growth habit with narrow, dark green leaves and thornless stems. Its flowers, when they do appear, are typically smaller and less showy compared to the typical form. The plant is native to certain regions of Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its unique traits, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant genetics and hybridization."
