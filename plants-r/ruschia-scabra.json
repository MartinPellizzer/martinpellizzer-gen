    "intro": "Ruschia scabra, commonly known as the rough Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It features dense, cylindrical stems covered in short, stiff hairs, giving it a rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, star-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, typically during the summer months. Its leaves are typically blue-gray in color and have a slightly hairy texture. Ruschia scabra is well adapted to arid environments and requires minimal water once established."
