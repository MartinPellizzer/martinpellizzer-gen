    "intro": "Ricinus salicinus, commonly known as the yellow cup plant, is a perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spiky seed capsules that contain toxic seeds, making it important to handle with care. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a valuable addition to native plant gardens and ecological restoration projects."
