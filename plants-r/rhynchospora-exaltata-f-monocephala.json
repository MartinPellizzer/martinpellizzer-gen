    "intro": "Rhynchospora exaltata f. monocephala, commonly known as the single-head spikegrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and produces small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils and partial to full sunlight. Its inflorescence is usually composed of a single, elongated head of flowers, which distinguishes it from other forms of the species. This botanical feature makes it easily identifiable in its native wetland environments."
