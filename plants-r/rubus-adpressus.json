    "intro": "Rubus adpressus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Its botanical features make it a common subject in ecological studies due to its role in supporting local wildlife."
