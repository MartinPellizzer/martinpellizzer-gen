    "intro": "Rapunculus hemisphaericus, commonly known as the globe thistle, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its spherical, spiny seed heads that resemble small, round thistles. The plant produces blue or purple flowers that bloom in early summer, adding a striking visual element to its habitat. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, giving them a silvery appearance. The globe thistle is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
