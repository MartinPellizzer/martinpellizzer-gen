    "intro": "Rubus foliosus, commonly known as the leafy blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, which are typically divided into several oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
