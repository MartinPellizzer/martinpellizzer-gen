    "intro": "Rhopalostylis sapida, commonly known as the Kauri tree, is a large evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, lance-shaped leaves that are glossy and dark green. The tree produces small, white flowers that are followed by edible, round fruits. Rhopalostylis sapida is a member of the Arecaceae family, which includes palms, and it plays a significant role in New Zealand's native ecosystems. Due to historical logging and habitat loss, it is now classified as an endangered species."
