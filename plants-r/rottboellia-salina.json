    "intro": "Rottboellia salina, commonly known as saltgrass, is a perennial grass species native to coastal regions of the Americas. It thrives in saline and alkaline soils, making it well adapted to coastal and estuarine environments. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that contain numerous tiny flowers. Rottboellia salina is often found in salt marshes and along shorelines where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and preventing erosion. Its ability to tolerate high salt concentrations makes it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
