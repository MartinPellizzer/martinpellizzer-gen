    "intro": "Regelia spectabilis, commonly known as the showy regelia, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its tall, erect stems and vibrant, showy flowers. The plant produces large, tubular flowers that come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, often with contrasting dark veins. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Regelia spectabilis is a popular choice for gardeners seeking a dramatic, flowering plant with ornamental value."
