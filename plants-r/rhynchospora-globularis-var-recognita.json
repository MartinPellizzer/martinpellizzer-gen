    "intro": "Rhynchospora globularis var. recognita, commonly known as the globular spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is characterized by its dense, globular inflorescence composed of numerous small, spike-like clusters of flowers. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often in marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a smooth texture, and it produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. This variety is notable for its ecological importance in supporting wetland biodiversity and maintaining soil stability in aquatic environments."
