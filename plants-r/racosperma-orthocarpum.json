    "intro": "Racosperma orthocarpum, commonly known as the broad-leaved acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its compound leaves and small, pea-like flowers. The plant is typically found in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. It produces flat, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Racosperma orthocarpum is often used in revegetation projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for native wildlife."
