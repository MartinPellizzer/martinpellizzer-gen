    "intro": "Rhamnoluma lecomtei, commonly known as the Lecomte's rhamnoluma, is a rare and endemic plant species found in specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae, which includes shrubs and trees characterized by opposite leaves and often milky sap. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest understories, where it thrives in humid and cool conditions. Its leaves are simple, ovate, and have a glossy surface, while its small, inconspicuous flowers are clustered in axillary inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rhamnoluma lecomtei is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
