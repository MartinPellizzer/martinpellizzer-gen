    "intro": "Rostellaria, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive orchid species native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, delicate flowers that resemble a ghostly silhouette. The plant relies on specific mycorrhizal fungi for nutrient uptake, as it lacks chlorophyll and cannot perform photosynthesis. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, with a striking, almost translucent appearance. Due to its habitat specificity and habitat loss, Rostellaria is considered endangered and is highly sought after in conservation efforts."
