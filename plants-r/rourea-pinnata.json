    "intro": "Rourea pinnata, commonly known as the velvetleaf rourea, is a shrub or small tree native to tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically followed by spherical, woody fruits containing several seeds. Rourea pinnata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Its botanical features make it a distinctive and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
