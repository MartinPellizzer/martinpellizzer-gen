    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. intermedia, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescent foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in cool, moist conditions. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of woolly hairs, which help to insulate it from extreme temperatures. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable climates."
