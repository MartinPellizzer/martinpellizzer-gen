    "intro": "Rorippa pyrenaica f. erosulata, commonly known as the Pyrenean watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of lanceolate, glaucous leaves and small, white or pinkish flowers that appear on slender pedicels. Native to the Pyrenees region, this subspecies thrives in moist, calcareous soils near streams and springs. The plant is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it contributes to the biodiversity of mountain ecosystems. Its morphology and ecological preferences make it an important indicator species for high-altitude wetlands."
