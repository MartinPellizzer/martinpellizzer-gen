    "intro": "Roegneria debilis, commonly known as the slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, hairless blades that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny florets, which are often wind-pollinated. Roegneria debilis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and along streambanks. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
