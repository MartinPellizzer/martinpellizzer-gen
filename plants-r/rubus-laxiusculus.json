    "intro": "Rubus laxiusculus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in woodland edges and hedgerows, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, though they are not as commonly consumed by humans as other Rubus species. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
