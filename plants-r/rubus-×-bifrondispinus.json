    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 bifrondispinus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry. It is a hybrid shrub native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible, though they are often tart and less commonly consumed than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are glossy and have a slightly serrated edge. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal chaparral habitats."
