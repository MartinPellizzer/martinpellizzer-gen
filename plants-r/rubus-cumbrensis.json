    "intro": "Rubus cumbrensis, commonly known as the Cumbrian blackberry, is a shrub native to the British Isles, particularly Wales and western England. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
