    "intro": "Ravenia, commonly known as the flame of the forest, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Lythraceae. It consists of several species, most of which are native to Southeast Asia, particularly India and Indonesia. The plants are characterized by their striking red or orange flowers, which bloom in dense clusters during the summer months. Ravenia species are typically shrubs or small trees, often found in tropical and subtropical regions. Their ornamental value makes them popular in horticulture, though they are not widely cultivated outside their native habitats."
