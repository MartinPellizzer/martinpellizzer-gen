    "intro": "Rubus gelertii var. criniger, commonly known as the white-haired bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to parts of Europe. It is characterized by its distinctive white or pale pink flowers and its hairy stems and leaves, which give it its common name. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring moist, well-drained conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
