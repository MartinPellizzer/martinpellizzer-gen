It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers that bloom from late spring to early fall. It thrives in partial to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking a low-maintenance ornamental plant. Ruellia tanacetifolia is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
