    "intro": "Ruschia horrida, commonly known as the woolly Ruschia, is a succulent plant native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive, almost fuzzy appearance. The plant produces bright orange or yellow flowers during the summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its unique appearance and drought tolerance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
