    "intro": "Rosa gizellae f. ditrichopoda, commonly known as the hairy-stemmed Rosa gizellae, is a botanical variant of the Rosa gizellae species. It is characterized by its distinctive hairy stems and foliage, which set it apart from other forms of the species. This plant typically grows in temperate regions, thriving in well-drained soils and partial sunlight. Its flowers are usually pink to red in color, with a fragrant aroma, and bloom during the late spring to early summer. Due to its unique morphological features, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists studying plant variation and adaptation."
