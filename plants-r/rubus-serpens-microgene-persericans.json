    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene persericans, commonly known as the Persian raspberry or small-fruited blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of Asia, particularly Iran and Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the presence of serrated leaves that are often hairy on the underside. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically clustered together. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in rocky or disturbed soils. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and for local consumption."
