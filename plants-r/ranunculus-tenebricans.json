    "intro": "Ranunculus tenebricans, commonly known as the shadowy buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, glandular stem. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Ranunculus tenebricans is considered a rare and endangered species."
