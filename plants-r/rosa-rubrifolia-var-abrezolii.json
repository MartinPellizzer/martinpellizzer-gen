    "intro": "Rosa rubrifolia var. abrezolii, commonly known as the Abrezolii rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves that are densely covered with fine, silvery-white hairs, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique botanical features, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
