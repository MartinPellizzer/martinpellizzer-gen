    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis microgene complanatispinus, commonly known as the flat-spined blackberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, pale green leaves with a hairy surface. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, contributing to its ornamental value. Due to its delicate structure and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
