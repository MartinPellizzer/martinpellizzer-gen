    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 stylosoformis var. pseudodumalis, commonly known as the pseudodumalis rose, is a hybrid species within the Rosa genus, characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems. It typically produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its foliage is often covered in a fine layer of soft, silvery-white down.
