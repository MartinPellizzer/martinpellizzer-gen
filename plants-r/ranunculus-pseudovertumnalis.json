It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features compound leaves with lobed segments and produces flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
