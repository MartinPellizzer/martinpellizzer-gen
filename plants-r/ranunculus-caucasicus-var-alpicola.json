    "intro": "Ranunculus caucasicus var. alpicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with serrated edges. It has a short, stout stem and is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
