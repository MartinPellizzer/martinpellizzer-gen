    "intro": "Rosa triphylla, commonly known as the three-leaf rose, is a species native to the eastern United States. It is a shrub-like plant that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet. The plant features trifoliate leaves, meaning each leaf is composed of three leaflets, which is a distinctive botanical characteristic. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and it produces red or orange hips in the fall. Rosa triphylla is often found in woodland areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
