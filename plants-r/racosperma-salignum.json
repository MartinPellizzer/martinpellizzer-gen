    "intro": "Racosperma salignum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, wiry stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has small, linear leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, aiding in moisture retention. It is well adapted to sandy soils and salt-laden environments, making it a hardy species. Racosperma salignum plays an important role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for native wildlife."
