    "intro": "Rumex acetosa subsp. papillaris, commonly known as sourgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and alternate, lance-shaped leaves with a serrated margin. The leaves are typically covered in fine, raised dots or papillae, which give the subspecies its name. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in dense spikes during the spring and summer months. This plant is often found in moist, calcareous soils and is sometimes used in traditional herbal medicine."
