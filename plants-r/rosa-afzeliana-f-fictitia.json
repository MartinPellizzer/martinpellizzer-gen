    "intro": "Rosa afzeliana f. fictitia, commonly known as the false rose or a hybrid form of the Afzelius rose, is a botanical variant characterized by its compact growth habit and ornamental value. It typically features semi-evergreen foliage with a dense, bushy structure that makes it suitable for hedges or topiary. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, often in clusters, during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, requiring moderate water and pruning for optimal growth. Despite its ornamental appeal, it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species due to its specific care requirements."
