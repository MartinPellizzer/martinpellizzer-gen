    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. horridissima, commonly known as the rough bristly rose, is a variant of the bristly rose species native to Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and leaves covered in fine, stiff hairs. The plant produces small, pink to red flowers that bloom in early summer. It thrives in rocky or arid environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Its botanical features make it well adapted to harsh, dry climates."
