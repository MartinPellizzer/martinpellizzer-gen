    "intro": "Razoumofskya minutissima, commonly known as the minute razoumofskya, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its delicate, small flowers and finely divided leaves. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, temperate climates. Its diminutive size and unique morphology make it a subject of interest for botanists studying alpine flora. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and somewhat elusive species."
