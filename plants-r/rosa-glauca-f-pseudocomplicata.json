    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. pseudocomplicata, commonly known as the blue rose or blue shrub rose, is a cultivar of the Rosa glauca species, which is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower color, which is a result of high levels of delphinidin pigments. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, oval-shaped leaves. Its flowers are usually single or semi-double, with a strong, sweet fragrance. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its aesthetic and aromatic qualities."
