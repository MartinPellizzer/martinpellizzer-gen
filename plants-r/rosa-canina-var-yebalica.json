    "intro": "Rosa canina var. yebalica, commonly known as the Yebalica rose, is a variant of the dog rose native to certain regions of southern Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in early summer, which give way to orange-red hips in autumn. These hips are rich in vitamin C and have been used in traditional medicine. Its botanical features make it a valuable species for both ornamental and ecological purposes."
