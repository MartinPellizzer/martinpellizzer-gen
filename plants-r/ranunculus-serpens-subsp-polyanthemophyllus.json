    "intro": "Ranunculus serpens subsp. polyanthemophyllus, commonly known as the polyanthemous buttercup, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its delicate, nodding yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, lobed leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Its stems are often prostrate or creeping, allowing it to spread along the ground. The subspecies is distinguished by its larger, more showy flowers compared to other members of the Ranunculus genus."
