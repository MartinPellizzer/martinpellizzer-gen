    "intro": "Rumex hydrolapathum var. americanum, commonly known as American dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It typically grows in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks, wetlands, and roadside ditches. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple underside, and it produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in the spring. It is often found in wet or semi-aquatic environments, and its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread readily. The species is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
