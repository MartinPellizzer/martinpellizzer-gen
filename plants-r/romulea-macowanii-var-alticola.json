    "intro": "Romulea macowanii var. alticola, commonly known as the highland romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and clusters of delicate, yellowish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late winter to early spring, producing showy, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine collections. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is often cultivated in controlled environments to ensure its survival."
