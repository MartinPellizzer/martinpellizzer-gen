    "intro": "Rabdosia effusa f. leucantha, commonly known as the white-flowered rabdosia, is a flowering plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The inflorescence consists of dense clusters of small, tubular flowers, typically white or pale blue in color. This variety is distinguished by its pale floral coloration, which sets it apart from the typical purple or pink flowers of the main species. It is native to Southeast Asia and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and rocky hillsides."
