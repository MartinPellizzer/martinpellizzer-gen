    "intro": "Rebutia multiplex, commonly known as the desert rose or the Mexican rose, is a succulent plant native to Mexico and the southwestern United States. It features a short, thick, branching stem covered in fleshy, spiny leaves that help it store water. The plant produces vibrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and orange, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in well-draining soil and full sun, requiring minimal water to prevent root rot. Rebutia multiplex is prized for its ornamental value and resilience in arid environments."
