    "intro": "Ranunculus lanuginosus proles umbrosus, commonly known as the woolly buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features finely divided, fern-like leaves covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland floors and stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
