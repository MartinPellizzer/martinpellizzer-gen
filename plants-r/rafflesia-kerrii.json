    "intro": "Rafflesia kerrii, commonly known as the giant broadleaf rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its vivid red petals are adorned with a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia kerrii is classified as a vulnerable species."
