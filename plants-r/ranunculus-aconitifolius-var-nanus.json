    "intro": "Ranunculus aconitifolius var. nanus, commonly known as the dwarf aconite-leaved buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that resemble those of aconite, hence its common name. The plant produces showy, yellow or pale yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky soils. Due to its ornamental value and unique foliage, it is cultivated in gardens with proper drainage and partial shade."
