    "intro": "Ranunculus pantothrix var. rigidus, commonly known as the rigid water crowfoot, is a perennial aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and wet meadows. The plant features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are usually submerged or floating, with a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Its flowers are small, yellow with brown or black markings, and bloom in early spring. The varietal form 'rigidus' is distinguished by its stiff, upright stems and leaves compared to other varieties of the species."
