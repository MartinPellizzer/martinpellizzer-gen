    "intro": "Rosa canina var. aspernata, commonly known as the aspernata rose, is a variant of the dog rose, characterized by its hairy stems and leaves. This plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland and scrubland habitats. It produces pale yellow to orange flowers that bloom in spring, followed by red, hairy fruits known as hips. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has historical uses in herbal medicine. Its botanical features make it distinct from the more commonly cultivated Rosa canina."
