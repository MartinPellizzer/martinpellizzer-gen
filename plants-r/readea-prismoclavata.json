    "intro": "Readea prismoclavata, commonly known as the prism-clawed readea, is a rare and unique species belonging to the family Rubiaceae. It is characterized by its distinctive prism-shaped leaf bases and claw-like leaf tips, which give it its scientific name. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist forest understories, where it thrives in cool and humid conditions. Its flowers are small and clustered, often displaying a combination of white and pale yellow hues. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Readea prismoclavata is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
