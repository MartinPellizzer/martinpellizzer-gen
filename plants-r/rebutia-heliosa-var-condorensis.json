    "intro": "Rebutia heliosa var. condorensis, commonly known as the Condor Sun Cactus, is a compact, globular cactus native to the Andes Mountains of Peru. It features a short, cylindrical stem covered in dense, white to pale green spines. The plant produces vibrant yellow flowers during the summer months, which are often followed by red or orange fruits. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its slow growth and unique appearance, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and cactus collections."
