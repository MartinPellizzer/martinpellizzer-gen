    "intro": "Ranunculus rigidulus, commonly known as the rigid buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a basal rosette of sturdy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, though they are technically not true petals. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges. Ranunculus rigidulus is known for its ability to spread through rhizomes, making it a persistent weed in some agricultural and natural settings."
