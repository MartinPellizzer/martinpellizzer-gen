    "intro": "Russelia rugosa, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red-leafed shrub, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and vibrant, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange. The leaves are typically velvety and dark green, providing a striking contrast to the bright blooms. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking ornamental foliage and nectar-rich flowers. Russelia rugosa is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds."
