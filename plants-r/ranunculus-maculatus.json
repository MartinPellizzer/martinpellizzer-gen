    "intro": "Ranunculus maculatus, commonly known as the spotted buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of palmately lobed, glossy green leaves with a distinctive white or yellowish veining. The plant produces showy, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, or red, often with a darker central blotch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens but is considered invasive in some regions."
