    "intro": "Rhododendron wardii, commonly known as the Ward's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to purple. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rhododendron wardii is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
