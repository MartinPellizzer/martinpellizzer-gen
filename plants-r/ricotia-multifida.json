It is a perennial herb with a hairy stem and alternate, narrow, lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in spring. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in arid or semi-arid environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
