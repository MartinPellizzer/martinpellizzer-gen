    "intro": "Reynoutria japonica var. humilis, commonly known as Japanese knotweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth system, which allows it to spread rapidly and aggressively. The plant features heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of hairs, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is known for its ability to tolerate a wide range of environmental conditions. Due to its invasive nature, it is considered a problematic species in many regions outside its native range."
