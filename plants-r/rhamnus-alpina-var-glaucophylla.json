It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a waxy, bluish-white coating, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by dark blue berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, harsh environments. This variety is often found in alpine meadows and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in its habitat."
