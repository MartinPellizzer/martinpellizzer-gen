    "intro": "Rubus radula subsp. timendus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its erect growth habit and thorny stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregated fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. This subspecies is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing food for local wildlife."
