    "intro": "Rosularia adenotricha subsp. viguieri, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rosebush, is a succulent plant native to the arid regions of Mexico. It features a compact, cushion-like growth habit with dense clusters of fleshy, blue-green leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. Its leaves are covered in fine, white hairs that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. It is well adapted to rocky soils and full sun exposure, making it a resilient choice for xeriscaping."
