    "intro": "Rumex hirsutus, commonly known as hairy sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features upright stems covered in fine, soft hairs, and its leaves are heart-shaped with a wavy margin. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which can be toxic in large quantities, but they are also used in some traditional cuisines. Rumex hirsutus thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks."
