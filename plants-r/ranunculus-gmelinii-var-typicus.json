    "intro": "Ranunculus gmelinii var. typicus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in high-altitude meadows and rocky areas, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features a short, stout stem with basal leaves that are palmately divided into lobes. Its flowers are bright yellow, with five to eight petals and numerous stamens, giving it a distinctive and showy appearance. It plays an important ecological role in alpine ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing soil in harsh environments."
