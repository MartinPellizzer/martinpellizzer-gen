It is a small evergreen tree that typically grows in humid, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its smooth, dark-brown bark and elliptical, leathery leaves. Its fragrant, yellowish flowers are followed by small, woody fruits containing seeds. Due to habitat loss and overharvesting, it is critically endangered, making conservation efforts essential for its survival."
