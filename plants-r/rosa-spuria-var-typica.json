    "intro": "Rosa spuria var. typica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or grayish down. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens with cold climates."
