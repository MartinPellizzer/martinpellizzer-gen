    "intro": "Restio nuwebergensis, commonly known as the Nuweberg restio, is a grass-like plant native to South Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and flowering spikes. The plant typically grows in coastal and mountainous regions, preferring well-drained soils and full sun exposure. Its flowering period occurs during the summer months, producing small, clustered flowers that are often white or pale in color. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
