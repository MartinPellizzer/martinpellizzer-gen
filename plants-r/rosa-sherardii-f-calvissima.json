    "intro": "Rosa sherardii f. calvissima, commonly known as the hairless shrub rose, is a botanical variant of the shrub rose species Rosa sherardii. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the typical form of the species. This form is native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates."
