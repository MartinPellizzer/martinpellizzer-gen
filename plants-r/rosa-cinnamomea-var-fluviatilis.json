    "intro": "Rosa cinnamomea var. fluviatilis, commonly known as the riverbank rose, is a perennial shrub native to the wetlands and riverbanks of eastern Asia. It features pale pink to white flowers with a distinctive cinnamon-scented fragrance, which is more pronounced in the evening. The plant has slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along water edges. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, fuzzy texture. This variety is adapted to moist soils and is often found in riparian habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing riverbanks."
