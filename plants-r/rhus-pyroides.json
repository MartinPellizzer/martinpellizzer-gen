    "intro": "Rhus pyroides, commonly known as the Florida holly, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features small, elliptical leaves that are glossy green on top and lighter underneath, with a waxy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for birds. Its root system is shallow but robust, allowing it to thrive in well-drained soils. Rhus pyroides is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to provide habitat for wildlife."
