    "intro": "Rubus amplus, commonly known as the broadleaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of tiny drupelets, which are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and riparian habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural areas."
