    "intro": "Rubus serpens subsp. commiscibilis, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a shrub native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it prefers moist, shaded environments. It plays a role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
