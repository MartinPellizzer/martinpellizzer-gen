    "intro": "Racosperma viscidulum, commonly known as sticky racosperma, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves with a sticky surface. The plant produces yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in sandy or rocky soils in arid and semi-arid regions. The sticky texture of its leaves is a notable botanical feature that may aid in water retention."
