It is characterized by its massive, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 6 meters in diameter, making it one of the largest palms in the world. The plant has a slender trunk that can grow up to 20 meters tall, often with a single, unbranched stem. Its leaves are typically green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside, with a fibrous texture. Raphia welwitschii thrives in humid, lowland areas and is often found near rivers and in swampy habitats."
