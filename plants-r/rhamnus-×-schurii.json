    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 schurii, commonly known as the hybrid dogwood, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is a natural hybrid between Rhamnus cathartica (common buckthorn) and Rhamnus alnifolia (sweet buckthorn), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The shrub typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with serrated edges. It produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. The plant is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
