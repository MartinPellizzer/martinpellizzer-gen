    "intro": "Radicula scabra, commonly known as the rough radicula, is a small, herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured stems and small, clustered leaves. The plant produces tiny, inconspicuous flowers that are often greenish or yellowish in color. It is adapted to survive in dry environments through its deep root system and water-storing tissues. Radicula scabra is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
