    "intro": "Rhynchosia albomarginata, commonly known as the white-margin sida, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It is a legume, belonging to the Fabaceae family, and is characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods containing several seeds. Rhynchosia albomarginata is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields, where it thrives in full sun. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
