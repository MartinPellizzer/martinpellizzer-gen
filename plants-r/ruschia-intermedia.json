    "intro": "Ruschia intermedia, commonly known as the blue ruschia, is a perennial succulent native to southern Africa. It features compact, fleshy leaves that are typically blue-gray in color, arranged in a rosette pattern. The plant produces vibrant orange to red flowers during the summer months, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or xeriscaping. Due to its drought tolerance and ornamental value, it is a popular choice for low-maintenance gardens."
