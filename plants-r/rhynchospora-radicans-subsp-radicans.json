    "intro": "Rhynchospora radicans subsp. radicans, commonly known as the creeping spike-rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to saturated soil conditions. The plant has slender, upright stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense colonies. Its flowering spikes are usually short and bear small, spike-like clusters of pale green to brownish flowers. The leaves are linear, grass-like, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its wetland environment."
