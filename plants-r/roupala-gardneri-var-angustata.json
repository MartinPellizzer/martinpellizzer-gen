    "intro": "Roupala gardneri var. angustata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved roupala, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically blooming in the spring. Its fruit is a small, woody capsule that splits open to release the seeds. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique foliage."
