    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. obovata, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and western Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20136 meters, featuring dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn red in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a notable species in ecological studies."
