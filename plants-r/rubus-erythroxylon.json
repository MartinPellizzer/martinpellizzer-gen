    "intro": "Rubus erythroxylon, commonly known as the red-rooted blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that turn from green to dark purple or black as they mature. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated margin and a slightly hairy surface. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
