    "intro": "Rubus glaucellus var. scabricaulis, commonly known as the scabrous-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
