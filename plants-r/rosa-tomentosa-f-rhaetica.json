    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa f. rhaetica, commonly known as the Rhaetian hairy rose, is a hybrid form of the hairy rose, characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and fragrant pink flowers. It is a deciduous shrub native to the Alps, particularly in Switzerland and Italy, where it thrives in high-altitude environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with thorny stems and broad, lobed leaves covered in a fine, white tomentum. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, producing a showy display that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance and fragrance."
