    "intro": "Rhynchospora axillaris var. microcephala, commonly known as the small-headed marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and swampy environments in the southeastern United States. It typically grows in dense clusters, reaching heights of up to 30 centimeters, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to brownish spikelets that are clustered at the ends of its stems, typical of the Cyperaceae family. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature common in many sedges. This variety is distinguished by its smaller, more compact inflorescences compared to other forms of Rhynchospora axillaris."
