    "intro": "Rhododendron dilatatum var. boreale, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features dense, dark green foliage with lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery-white pubescence. Its flowers are showy, appearing in clusters of 3 to 6, with petals that range from pink to red, depending on the specific variety. This variant is well adapted to harsh climates and plays an important ecological role in its native habitat."
