    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the giant castor bean plant, is a striking species characterized by its large, palmately lobed leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter. Native to tropical regions of Africa, it thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules containing toxic seeds, which contain ricin, one of the most potent natural toxins. It is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family and is known for its rapid growth and ability to reach heights of up to 5 meters. Due to its toxicity, it requires careful handling and is often grown in controlled environments."
