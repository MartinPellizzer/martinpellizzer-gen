    "intro": "Rumex sinuatus, commonly known as the wavy-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist soils along stream banks, marshes, and other wetland habitats. The plant features broad, wavy-edged leaves that are often reddish or purple on the underside. Its flowers are small and clustered in dense, upright spikes, and it produces elliptical, dark reddish-brown seeds. Rumex sinuatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
