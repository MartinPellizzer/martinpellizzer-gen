    "intro": "Rebutia grandiflora, commonly known as the giant rebutia, is a species of cactus native to South America. It is characterized by its thick, ribbed stems that can grow up to 1 meter in height. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers during the spring and summer months. It thrives in well-draining soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its striking appearance and relatively easy care, it is a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping."
