    "intro": "Rhododendron rhantum, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a species native to eastern Asia, particularly China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dense, leathery leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are borne on pedicels. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated for both horticultural and conservation purposes."
