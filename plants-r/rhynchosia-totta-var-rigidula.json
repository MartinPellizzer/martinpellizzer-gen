    "intro": "Rhynchosia totta var. rigidula, commonly known as the rigid rat-tail bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical regions of Africa and Asia. It features slender, serpentine stems that can grow up to several meters in length, often trailing or twining around supports. The plant produces small, yellow flowers followed by elongated, bean-like pods that are typically rigid and sparsely hairy. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and it is adapted to thrive in well-drained, sandy soils. Rhynchosia totta var. rigidula is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its unique growth habit."
