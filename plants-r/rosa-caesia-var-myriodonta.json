    "intro": "Rosa caesia var. myriodonta, commonly known as the Myriodonta rose, is a rare and ornamental variety of rose native to South Africa. It is characterized by its fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and unique floral characteristics, it is highly valued by horticulturists and plant collectors."
