    "intro": "Rumex cyprius subsp. vesceritensis, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on erect, slender stalks. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
