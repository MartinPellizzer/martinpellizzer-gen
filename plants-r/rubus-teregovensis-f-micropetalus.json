    "intro": "Rubus teregovensis f. micropetalus, commonly known as the small-petaled blackberry, is a botanical variant of the blackberry plant native to the Carpathian region. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate petals compared to the typical Rubus teregovensis, giving it a distinct floral appearance. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of the standard species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological traits and potential for hybridization with other Rubus species."
