    "intro": "Ranunculus adoneus var. typicus, commonly known as the yellow marsh cinquefoil, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, five-petaled yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps repel water. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators in wetland ecosystems."
