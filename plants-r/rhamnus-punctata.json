    "intro": "Rhamnus punctata, commonly known as the spotted buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters, featuring slender, often thorned stems and small, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are edible for some bird species. Its leaves are often marked with distinctive white or pale spots, which give it its common name. Rhamnus punctata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
