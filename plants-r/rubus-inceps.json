    "intro": "Rubus inceps, commonly known as the Ince's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces dark purple to black berries that are typically small and tart. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or semi-shaded environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and lesser-known member of the Rubus genus."
