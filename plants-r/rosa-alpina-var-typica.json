It is characterized by its compact growth habit and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it has a woody stem that becomes more branched with age.
