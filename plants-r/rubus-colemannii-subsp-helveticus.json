    "intro": "Rubus colemannii subsp. helveticus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a shrub that typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, often on rocky or gravelly slopes. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in short, glandular hairs. This subspecies is adapted to cold climates and is often found at high altitudes where few other plants can thrive."
