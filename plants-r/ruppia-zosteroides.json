It thrives in brackish and marine environments, often found in estuaries and tidal flats. The plant has long, ribbon-like leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along its stem. It produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are pollinated by water currents. Ruppia zosteroides plays an important role in stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for various aquatic organisms."
