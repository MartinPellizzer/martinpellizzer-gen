    "intro": "Rhus toxicarium, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its large, fuzzy, compound leaves that turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. Its bark is rough and fissured, with a distinctive appearance that gives it its common name. Rhus toxicarium thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in open woodlands and disturbed areas."
