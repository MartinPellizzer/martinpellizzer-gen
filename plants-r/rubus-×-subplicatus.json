    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 subplicatus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in temperate regions, often in wet or boggy soils. The plant produces small, red-orange fruits that are tart and somewhat tangy in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its stems are covered in fine, prickly bristles. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its use in culinary applications, though its fruits are not as widely cultivated as those of other Rubus species."
