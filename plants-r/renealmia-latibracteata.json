It is native to tropical regions of South America, particularly Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. Its inflorescence consists of spikelets that are often concealed within leaf sheaths, a feature typical of many grasses. Renealmia latibracteata is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and wetlands."
