    "intro": "Rosa caesia f. transiens, commonly known as the transient pink rose, is a rare and hybrid form of the Rosa caesia species. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink flowers that bloom briefly during the spring season. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sunlight, making it suitable for gardens with moderate climates. Due to its limited natural range and fleeting blooming period, it is considered a rare ornamental plant in horticultural collections."
