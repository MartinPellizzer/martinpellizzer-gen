    "intro": "Rumex chiloensis, commonly known as Chilean sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often eaten raw in salads. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by triangular, reddish-brown seeds. It thrives in moist, temperate climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Its leaves contain oxalic acid, which gives it a tart flavor and makes it a popular ingredient in traditional cuisines."
