It features aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with a distinctive, often fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in umbels, followed by small, oval-shaped fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it adaptable to rocky or arid environments. The plant contains volatile oils and alkaloids, which contribute to its strong scent and historical use in traditional medicine."
