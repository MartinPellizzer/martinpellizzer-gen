    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. leucantha, commonly known as the white-leafed rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, woolly foliage that gives it a unique, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to cold climates and can thrive in rocky or well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with appropriate conditions."
