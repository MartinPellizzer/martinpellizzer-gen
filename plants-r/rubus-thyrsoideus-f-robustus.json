    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus f. robustus, commonly known as the robust raspberry, is a vigorous shrub native to the temperate regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, serrated leaves that are typically dark green on top and pale underneath. The plant produces clusters of small, usually pink or white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible red berries in the summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for hedgerows and ornamental gardens. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in ecological restoration projects."
