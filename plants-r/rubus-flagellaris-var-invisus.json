    "intro": "Rubus flagellaris var. invisus, commonly known as the invisible raspberry, is a rare variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of eastern North America. It is characterized by its diminutive, nearly invisible fruits that are often overlooked due to their pale coloration and small size. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges, typical of the Rubus genus, but its flowers are usually less showy than those of other raspberry species. It thrives in shaded, moist environments, often found in woodland understories. Due to its elusive nature and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and under-studied species within the Rubus family."
