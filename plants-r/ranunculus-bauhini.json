It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers in shades of yellow, orange, and red, often with a contrasting dark center. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and borders. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its early spring blooming habit."
