It is characterized by its distinctive leaf margins, which feature irregular, serrated teeth. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its fruits are small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. This fern-like shrub contributes to the biodiversity of its native habitats and is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
