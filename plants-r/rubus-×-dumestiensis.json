    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 dumestiensis, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a deciduous shrub that belongs to the Rosaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rubus ursinus (evergreen raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (cloudberry), resulting in a plant with unique botanical characteristics. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils in temperate regions, often in forested areas or wetlands. Its stems are covered in stiff, prickly bracts, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are a mix of raspberry and blackberry traits. The hybrid is valued for its fruit, which has a distinctive flavor and is used in culinary applications."
