    "intro": "Rubus silesiacus microgene amygdalanthoides, commonly known as the Silesian almond-fruit raspberry, is a rare and distinctive member of the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and fruits that resemble almonds in texture and appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and the stems are covered in fine, glandular hairs. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically rare species."
