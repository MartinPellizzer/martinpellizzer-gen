It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The flowers are usually white or pale pink, and the plant is valued for both its ornamental appeal and edible fruits."
