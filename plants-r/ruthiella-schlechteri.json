    "intro": "Ruthiella schlechteri, commonly known as the Schlechter's ruthiella, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Apiaceae family, which includes parsley and carrots, and is characterized by its finely divided, fern-like leaves. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species."
