    "intro": "Rumex ochotensis, commonly known as Siberian sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the cold regions of Asia. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, temperate environments. Rumex ochotensis is valued for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor."
