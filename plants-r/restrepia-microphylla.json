    "intro": "Restrepia microphylla, commonly known as the miniature lady's slipper orchid, is a rare and delicate orchid native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, intricate flowers that resemble a lady's slipper, with a unique pouch-like structure that aids in pollination. The plant typically grows on rock faces or in shaded, humid environments, showing adaptations to its challenging habitat. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces a single flower per stem, usually in the spring. Due to its rarity and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
