    "intro": "Rotala verdcourtii, commonly known as the African waterwheel, is a aquatic plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its whorled arrangement of narrow, lance-shaped leaves that float on the water's surface. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, typically emerging above the water. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments and is often used in pond landscaping. Rotala verdcourtii is also valued for its ability to provide habitat for aquatic organisms and its aesthetic appeal in water gardens."
