    "intro": "Rhus succedanea var. japonica, commonly known as Japanese sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a serrated edge. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by orange-red berries that are toxic to humans and livestock. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy plant suitable for various climates. The bark and leaves have been used in traditional medicine, though caution is advised due to its toxic properties."
