    "intro": "Rhododendron borneense subsp. borneense, commonly known as the Bornean rhododendron, is a species native to the tropical rainforests of Borneo. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red. The plant typically grows as a shrub or small tree, reaching heights of up to 5 meters. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, with a waxy surface that helps it retain moisture in humid conditions. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a landscape plant in tropical regions."
