    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. caroli-frederici, commonly known as the Caroli-Frederici buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five broad, petal-like sepals that are often adorned with a distinctive greenish or brownish blotch. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with slender, hairy stems and trifoliate or palmate leaves. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique floral markings and slightly different leaf morphology compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
