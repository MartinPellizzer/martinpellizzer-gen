    "intro": "Rhus exelliana, commonly known as the African torch tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish bark and its striking, bright red or orange-red fruits that appear in clusters. The plant produces small, white flowers in spring, followed by the showy, persistent fruits that provide food for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Rhus exelliana is also valued for its ability to tolerate drought and poor soil conditions."
