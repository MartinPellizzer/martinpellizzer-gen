    "intro": "Rhus microlepis, commonly known as the Chinese lacquer tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically odd-pinnate with small, ovate leaflets. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by red or orange berries that are toxic to humans. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it is known for its ability to produce a natural resin used in traditional lacquer production. Rhus microlepis thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forested areas."
