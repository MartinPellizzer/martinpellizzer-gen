    "intro": "Raycadenco ecuadorensis, commonly known as the Ecuadorian raycadenco, is a flowering plant native to the cloud forests of Ecuador. It belongs to the family Malvaceae and is characterized by its showy, pentagonal flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub with lance-shaped leaves and produces capsule fruits that contain numerous small seeds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is adapted to the high-altitude conditions of its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
