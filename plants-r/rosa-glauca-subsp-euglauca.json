    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. euglauca, commonly known as the blue rose, is a subspecies native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its striking blue to violet flower color, which is a rare trait in the rose family due to the presence of delphinidin, a type of anthocyanin pigment. The plant typically grows in rocky and well-drained soils, preferring sunny to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and the stems are often covered in thorns. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been cultivated for its unique floral coloration."
