    "intro": "Rhamnus frangula f. angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf buckthorn, is a subspecies of the European buckthorn. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in temperate regions, characterized by its angular, often thorny stems. The leaves are lanceolate, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface, and they are arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are toxic to humans and animals. It is often found in woodlands, hedgerows, and along roadsides, where it thrives in partial shade to full sun."
