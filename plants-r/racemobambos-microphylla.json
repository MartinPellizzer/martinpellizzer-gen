    "intro": "Racemobambos microphylla, commonly known as the dwarf bamboo, is a small evergreen shrub native to the eastern coast of Africa. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) and is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that form dense clumps. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal racemes, followed by tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal forests and sandy soils. Due to its compact size and ornamental appeal, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
