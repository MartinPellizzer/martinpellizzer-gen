    "intro": "Rumex acetosella subsp. acetosella, commonly known as sour grass, is a low-growing perennial plant characterized by its succulent, reddish stems and oval, serrated leaves. It typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in shaded environments such as woodlands and heaths. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on short, erect stalks. Its leaves contain high levels of oxalic acid, contributing to its tart flavor and medicinal uses. It is also known for its ability to thrive in nutrient-poor soils, making it a common pioneer species in disturbed habitats."
