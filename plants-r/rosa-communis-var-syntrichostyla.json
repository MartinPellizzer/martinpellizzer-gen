It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant produces rose hips that are rich in vitamin C and serve as a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing at high altitudes where it is adapted to cold and harsh conditions. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine landscapes."
