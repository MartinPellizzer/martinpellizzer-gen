    "intro": "Ricinus communis var. spontaneus, commonly known as the common castor oil plant, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Africa, Asia, and South America. It is characterized by its distinctive palmate leaves and spiny calyx that encloses its unique, spiky flowers. The plant produces toxic seeds that contain ricin, a potent toxin, and is often cultivated for its oil-rich seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is adaptable to various soil types. Due to its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine, it is widely grown in gardens and agricultural settings."
