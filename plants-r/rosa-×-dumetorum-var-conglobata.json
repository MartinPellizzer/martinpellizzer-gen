    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum var. conglobata, commonly known as the creeping tea rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant with dense, thornless stems that often grow close to the ground. Its leaves are typically dark green, glossy, and arranged in odd-pinnate patterns with small, oval leaflets. The flowers are small, fragrant, and usually pink to red in color, blooming in clusters throughout the growing season. It is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained soil with full sun exposure. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to form dense ground cover in gardens."
