    "intro": "Rosa canina f. fissidens, commonly known as the fissured dog rose, is a botanical variant of the common dog rose. It is characterized by its distinctive, fissured or split petals, which set it apart from the typical single-layered petals of Rosa canina. This plant is native to southern Europe and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. It produces fragrant pink flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
