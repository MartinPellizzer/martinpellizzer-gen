    "intro": "Rubus discolor var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant characterized by its lack of thorns on the stems. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when ripe. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and it has a woody structure that supports its climbing or trailing growth habit. This variant is valued for its edible fruits and is often cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
