    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. absimilis, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a compact, shrub-like plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant has leathery, elliptical leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens for its beauty and resilience."
