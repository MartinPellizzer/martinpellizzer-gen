The plant produces small, edible fruits that are often used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are heart-shaped and have a slightly rough texture, while its flowers emit a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Rivea ornata thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in gardens and hanging baskets."
