    "intro": "Ranunculus fallax subsp. festivus, commonly known as the early yellow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe. It features delicate, cup-shaped yellow flowers with a distinctive central greenish eye. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges, typically growing in moist meadows and woodland edges. It blooms in early spring, often before its close relatives, and is characterized by its short, upright stems. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens despite its natural habitat preferences."
