    "intro": "Rubus mundus, commonly known as the celestial raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes. It is characterized by its compound leaves and clusters of small, dark red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant is notable for its aromatic foliage and its ability to thrive in cool, moist environments. Its flowers are white with five petals and are pollinated by bees and other insects. Due to its unique habitat and limited distribution, Rubus mundus is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
