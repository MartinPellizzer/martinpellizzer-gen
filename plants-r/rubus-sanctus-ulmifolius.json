    "intro": "Rubus sanctus ulmifolius, commonly known as the sacred raspberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which resemble those of the elm tree, giving it its specific epithet *ulmifolius*. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in woodland areas and is often found in moist, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a species of conservation concern in some regions."
