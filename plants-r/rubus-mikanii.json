    "intro": "Rubus mikanii, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and showy white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are edible but often tart. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodlands and shrublands. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
