    "intro": "Rubus schmidelyanus var. aviivagus, commonly known as the Alpine blackberry, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to the mountainous regions of Central Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
