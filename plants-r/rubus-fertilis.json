    "intro": "Rubus fertilis, commonly known as the fertilized raspberry, is a species of bramble in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits. The plant typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its flowers are pink to white, and it produces edible berries that are similar to those of other Rubus species. However, it is less commonly cultivated compared to other raspberries due to its specific habitat requirements."
