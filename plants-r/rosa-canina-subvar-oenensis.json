    "intro": "Rosa canina subvar. oenensis, commonly known as the Spanish rose or the wild rose of the Iberian Peninsula, is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. It produces pink to red flowers in the spring, which are followed by orange to red hips, its distinctive fruit. The plant is native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa, thriving in sunny, well-drained soils. It is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along coastal areas. The hips are rich in vitamin C and have been traditionally used in herbal remedies and culinary applications."
