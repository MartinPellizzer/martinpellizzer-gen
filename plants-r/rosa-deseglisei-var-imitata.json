    "intro": "Rosa deseglisei var. imitata, commonly known as the imitate rose, is a compact shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features dense, thornless stems and small, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well adapted to coastal and rocky environments, thriving in full sun and well-drained soils. Due to its ornamental value and limited distribution, it is often cultivated in gardens with care."
