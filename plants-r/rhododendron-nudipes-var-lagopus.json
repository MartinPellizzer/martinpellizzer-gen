    "intro": "Rhododendron nudipes var. lagopus, commonly known as the alpine heath rhododendron, is a compact shrub native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features dense, evergreen foliage with small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and covered in a fine, white waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, well-drained soils and is adapted to harsh mountainous environments. Due to its unique appearance and ecological significance, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens and conservation areas."
