    "intro": "Ranunculus chaerophyllos subsp. leucothrix, commonly known as the white-leaved water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wet or marshy habitats, preferring moist soils and full to partial sunlight. The plant features finely divided, fern-like leaves and produces clusters of small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals. Its flowers are often short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The subspecies is distinguished by its pale coloration and leaf structure, setting it apart from other members of the Ranunculus genus."
