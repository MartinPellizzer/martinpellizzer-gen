    "intro": "Rubus hebecaulis subsp. salisburgensis, commonly known as the Salzburg bramble, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant produces white to pale pink flowers in early summer, followed by edible, red, hairy berries. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in mountainous habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
