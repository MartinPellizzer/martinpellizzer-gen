    "intro": "Rubus minusculus var. minusculus, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry or small-fruited raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark red to black in color. Its flowering period occurs in early summer, with white to pale pink flowers that attract pollinators. The plant is often confused with other Rubus species due to its similar appearance and growth habit."
