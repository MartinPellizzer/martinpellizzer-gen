    "intro": "Roupala sculpta, commonly known as the sculpted roupala, is a small evergreen shrub native to the wet tropical forests of Madagascar. It is characterized by its unique, twisted branches and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces small, fragrant yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its bark is thick and corky, providing a natural camouflage in its native habitat. Roupala sculpta is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens for its distinctive appearance."
