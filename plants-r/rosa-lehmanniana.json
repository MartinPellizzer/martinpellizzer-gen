    "intro": "Rosa lehmanniana, commonly known as the Lehmann's rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers. The plant has dark green, glossy foliage that provides a striking contrast to its showy blooms. It is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soil, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Rosa lehmanniana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
