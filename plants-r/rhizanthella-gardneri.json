    "intro": "Rhizanthella gardneri, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and elusive flowering plant native to the rainforests of eastern Australia. It is a terrestrial orchid that lacks true leaves and relies entirely on its roots for photosynthesis. The plant produces delicate, fragrant flowers that are typically pink or white in color. Rhizanthella gardneri is notable for its unique underground growth habit, with its roots forming a symbiotic relationship with fungi. Due to its habitat specificity and vulnerability to environmental changes, it is considered critically endangered."
