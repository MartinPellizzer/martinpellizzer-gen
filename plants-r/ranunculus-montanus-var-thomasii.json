    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. thomasii, commonly known as Thomas's buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to nine petals and is typically found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and stream banks. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and sometimes toxic plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some regions."
