    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pseudacutiusculus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five petals, often adorned with a distinctive greenish or brownish central mark. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are typically shorter and narrower than those of the typical *R. auricomus*. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The subspecies is distinguished by its more acute leaf lobes and smaller, more compact flowers compared to the broader-leaved forms."
