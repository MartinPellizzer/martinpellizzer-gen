It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and clusters of fragrant, white to pale pink flowers. The species thrives in calcareous soils, which are rich in calcium, hence its specific epithet \"calcicola.\" It is often found in rocky or mountainous regions, where it adapts to harsh environmental conditions. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable soil conditions."
