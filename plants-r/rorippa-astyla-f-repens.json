    "intro": "Rorippa astyla f. repens, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a low-growing, aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to wetlands and stream edges. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a smooth, waxy surface. The plant produces tiny, white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically from late spring to early summer. It is a member of the Brassicaceae family, which includes other cruciferous plants. This variety is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, allowing it to spread across the water's surface or along moist soil."
