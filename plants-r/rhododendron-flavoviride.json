    "intro": "Rhododendron flavoviride, commonly known as the yellow-green rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its vibrant yellow-green foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Rhododendron flavoviride is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to add color to woodland gardens."
