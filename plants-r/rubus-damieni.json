    "intro": "Rubus damieni, commonly known as the Damien blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. These berries are known for their intense flavor and high antioxidant content. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rubus damieni is considered a rare and endangered species."
