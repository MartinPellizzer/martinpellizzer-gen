    "intro": "Ruschiella, commonly known as the rock rose, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. Ruschiella species are typically found in rocky or sandy soils, thriving in arid or semi-arid environments. They have small, hairy leaves that help reduce water loss, and their stems are often succulent. The genus includes several species, such as Ruschiella parviflora and Ruschiella saxicola, which are popular in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
