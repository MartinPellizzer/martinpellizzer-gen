    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. subrobustus, commonly known as the robust buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features basal leaves that are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while its stems are hairy and can grow up to 30 cm in height. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typically appearing from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some regions."
