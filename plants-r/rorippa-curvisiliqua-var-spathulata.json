It is characterized by its succulent, ovate leaves that are often submerged or floating in aquatic environments. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its roots are fibrous and adapted for anchoring in muddy or aquatic substrates. This variety is often found in ponds, ditches, and wet meadows, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems."
