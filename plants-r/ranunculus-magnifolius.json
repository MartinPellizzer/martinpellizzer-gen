    "intro": "Ranunculus magnifolius, commonly known as the giant buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the eastern United States. It features striking, showy flowers with bright yellow petals and a prominent central pistil, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has palmately lobed leaves that are deeply divided, giving it a distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or wetland habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
