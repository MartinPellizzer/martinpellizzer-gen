    "intro": "Rinorea convallarioides subsp. marsabitensis, commonly known as the Marsabit rinorea, is a flowering plant native to the highlands of Kenya. It is characterized by its climbing habit and heart-shaped leaves with a waxy surface. The species produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on the stems. It thrives in cool, humid environments and is often found in forested areas at elevations above 2,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
