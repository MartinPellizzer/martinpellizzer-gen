    "intro": "Restrepia caucana, commonly known as the Caucana orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the high-altitude regions of the Andes in South America. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its compact, clump-forming growth habit. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers with intricate patterns, typically blooming in late summer. Its pseudobulbs are cylindrical and covered in a thick, fibrous sheath, which helps it store water in its native arid environment. Restrepia caucana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated by orchid enthusiasts."
