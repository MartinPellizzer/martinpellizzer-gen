    "intro": "Rubus niveus var. pauciflorus, commonly known as the snowberry bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its white, aggregate fruits that resemble small snowballs, which give it its common name. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, white flowers in the spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
