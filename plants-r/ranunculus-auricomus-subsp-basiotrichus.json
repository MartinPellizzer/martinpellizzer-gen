    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. basiotrichus, commonly known as the golden ragwort, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers. The plant has palmately divided leaves with a hairy underside, which distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. Its flowers bloom in early summer and are often visited by bees and other pollinators. The subspecies is notable for its slightly different leaf structure and habitat preferences compared to the typical form of *Ranunculus auricomus*."
