    "intro": "Rubus cognatus, commonly known as the western blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are actually clusters of small drupes, typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. Rubus cognatus is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in local ecosystems."
