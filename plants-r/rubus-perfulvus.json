    "intro": "Rubus perfulvus, commonly known as the yellow raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves that are often covered in fine, yellowish pubescence. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically yellow or orange in color, which are edible but have a tart, acidic flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
