    "intro": "Rhodora canadensis, commonly known as the Canadian rhodora, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in early spring before the leaves emerge. Its leaves are alternate, elliptical, and have a leathery texture, while its bark is smooth and reddish-brown. Rhodora canadensis thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in moist, shaded woodlands."
