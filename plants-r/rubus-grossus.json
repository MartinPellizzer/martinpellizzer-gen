    "intro": "Rubus grossus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and has a robust growth habit that often forms dense thickets. Its flowers are white and clustered, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and fibrous. Rubus grossus plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and supporting local biodiversity."
