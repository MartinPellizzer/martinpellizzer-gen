    "intro": "Regelia innocentii, commonly known as the innocent regelia, is a rare and striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is a member of the Cactaceae family and is characterized by its tall, spiny stems and large, showy flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, sunny conditions. Its flowers bloom in late summer and are pollinated primarily by bees and other insects. Due to its unique appearance and limited natural habitat, Regelia innocentii is considered a rare and valuable species in botanical collections."
