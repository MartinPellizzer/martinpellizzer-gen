    "intro": "Rhodiola euryphylla, commonly known as the alpine rose or tundra rhodiola, is a perennial plant native to cold, high-altitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It belongs to the family Crassulaceae and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pink or white flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh environments, with a deep root system that helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. It thrives in alpine tundras and rocky slopes, often growing at elevations above 2,000 meters. Rhodiola euryphylla is also valued for its potential medicinal properties, though further research is needed to confirm its therapeutic uses."
