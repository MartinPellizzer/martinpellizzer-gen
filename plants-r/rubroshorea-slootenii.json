    "intro": "Rubroshorea slootenii, commonly known as the redshorea or redwood tree, is a member of the Dipterocarpaceae family, native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its tall, straight trunk and broad, glossy leaves that are typically a deep green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are often yellow or orange in color, which are pollinated by insects. Its wood is highly valued for its strength and durability, making it important in local timber industries. However, due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
