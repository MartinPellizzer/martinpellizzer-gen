It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in woodland and hedgerow environments, often growing in partial shade. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
