    "intro": "Rumex candollei, commonly known as the Candolle's sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves, which are typically reddish or purple in color due to high concentrations of anthocyanins. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense, terminal clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in cloud forests and along stream banks. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been studied for its potential medicinal properties."
