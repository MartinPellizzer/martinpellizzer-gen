    "intro": "Ranunculus pygmaeus var. sabinii, commonly known as the dwarf buttercup, is a small flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows to a height of less than 10 centimeters, with delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers. The plant prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. It is an herbaceous perennial that blooms in early spring, adding a splash of color to its natural environment. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
