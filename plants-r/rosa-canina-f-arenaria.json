    "intro": "Rosa canina f. arenaria, commonly known as the sand rose or sand rose bush, is a subspecies of the dog rose. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems, typically found in sandy or coastal environments. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in spring, followed by orange-red hips, which are its fruit. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets. This subspecies is adapted to harsh, well-drained soils and is often used in coastal landscaping due to its hardiness and aesthetic appeal."
