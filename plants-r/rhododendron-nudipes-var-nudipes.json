    "intro": "Rhododendron nudipes var. nudipes, commonly known as the naked-leaved rhododendron, is a unique species native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its distinctive, leathery leaves that are often glabrous or nearly glabrous, giving it its common name. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
