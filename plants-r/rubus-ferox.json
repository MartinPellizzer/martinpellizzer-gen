It is characterized by its thorny stems and large, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep black color. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained environments. Rubus ferox is often found in woodlands, thickets, and along stream banks."
