    "intro": "Rubus bijugus, commonly known as the twin-lobed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple tiny drupes. The plant produces compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its flowers are typically white or pale pink. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The fruit is edible, though it is generally less palatable than other blackberry varieties."
