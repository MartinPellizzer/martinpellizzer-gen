    "intro": "Rochelia leiocarpa, commonly known as the smooth-seeded rockcress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are pinnately divided and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence. Rochelia leiocarpa is adapted to survive in harsh, rocky environments and is often found in crevices and on slopes."
