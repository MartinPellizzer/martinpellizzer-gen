    "intro": "Ranunculus tenuirostrus, commonly known as the narrow-beaked buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a prominent central seed head. The plant typically grows to a height of 10\u201330 cm, with hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is considered a rare and endangered species in its natural range."
