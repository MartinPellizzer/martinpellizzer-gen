    "intro": "Robinia filiformis, commonly known as the slender false acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its long, slender, and often twisted stems that can grow up to 15 meters in height. The plant produces small, yellow, pea-like flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by pods that contain several seeds. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. Robinia filiformis is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks."
