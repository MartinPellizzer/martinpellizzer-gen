    "intro": "Rhynchosia holosericea, commonly known as the silky senna, is a species of flowering plant in the legume family, Fabaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its slender, climbing habit and pinnate leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. Rhynchosia holosericea is notable for its silky, hairy texture on both its stems and leaves, which gives it its common name. It is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
