It features upright, branched stems that are often covered in a dense, woolly pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a dark purple to reddish hue on the upper surface and a lighter, often hairy underside. It produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red or yellow when ripe. This plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often used in native plant gardens."
