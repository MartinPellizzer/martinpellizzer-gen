    "intro": "Rosa elymaitica var. tomentella, commonly known as the woolly evergreen rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and evergreen foliage that remains lush throughout the year. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in spring. Its leaves are leathery and covered in a fine, woolly layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions. This variety is well-suited to coastal and rocky environments due to its drought tolerance and hardy nature."
