    "intro": "Rubus serpens microgene longisepalus, commonly known as the long-sepal raspberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, prickly stems that often root at the nodes. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pink flowers, which are followed by red, hairy berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the sepals are notably elongated, giving it its specific epithet. This species is native to certain regions of South America and is often found in moist, shaded environments."
