    "intro": "Rosa canina var. neomontana, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain dog rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces red, hairy fruits known as hips, which are rich in vitamin C. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated as an ornamental plant."
