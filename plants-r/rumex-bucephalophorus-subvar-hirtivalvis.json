    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus subvar. hirtivalvis, commonly known as the hairy-leaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, lanceolate leaves. The leaves are typically covered with fine, erect hairs, giving the plant its common name. It produces tall, slender flowering stems that bear small, greenish-white flowers in clusters. The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and is often found in moist, disturbed soils such as roadsides and meadows. Its botanical features make it easily distinguishable from other dock species."
