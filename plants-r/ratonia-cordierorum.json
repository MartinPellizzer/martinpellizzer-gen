    "intro": "Ratonia cordierorum, commonly known as the Cordier's ratonia, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the island of Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and woody stems. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within the rainforests of Madagascar. Its leaves are elliptical and glossy, and it produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that bloom during the rainy season. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Ratonia cordierorum is considered critically endangered."
