    "intro": "Rhinocidium, commonly known as the horned poppy, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Papaveraceae. It is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers that resemble poppies, with petals that can be either single or double. The plant typically grows in arid or semi-arid regions, thriving in well-drained soils. Rhinocidium species are known for their unique horn-like structures on the stems or leaves, which give the plant its common name. These plants are often cultivated for their ornamental value and are also used in traditional medicine in some cultures."
