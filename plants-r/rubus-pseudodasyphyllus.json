    "intro": "Rubus pseudodasyphyllus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a shrub native to the high Andes of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and dark green, velvety leaves that have a silvery underside. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
