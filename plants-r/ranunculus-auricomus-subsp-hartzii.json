    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. hartzii, commonly known as the Hartz's buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight broad, petal-like sepals that resemble small cups. The plant typically grows in moist, grassy habitats at high elevations, often in alpine meadows. Its leaves are deeply lobed and arranged in a basal rosette, and it produces a cluster of hairy, yellowish fruits that disperse by wind. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its vibrant, early spring blooms."
