    "intro": "Rottlera fuscescens, commonly known as the black-rooted rottlera, is a perennial shrub native to the tropical regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, woody roots and stems, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, brownish hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, and its leaves are alternate, ovate, and often have a slightly serrated edge. Rottlera fuscescens is known for its aromatic properties and has been used in traditional medicine for its potential therapeutic benefits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories."
