    "intro": "Rubus onsalaensis, commonly known as the Onsala bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to southern Scandinavia, particularly found in Sweden and parts of northern Germany. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. Its leaves are typically compound, with five to seven leaflets, and it produces small, edible berries that ripen in late summer. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
