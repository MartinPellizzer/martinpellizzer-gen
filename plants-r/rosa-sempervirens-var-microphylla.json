    "intro": "Rosa sempervirens var. microphylla, commonly known as the evergreen rose or miniature evergreen rose, is a compact shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces fragrant, pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is well-suited for container gardening and as a hedge due to its hardy nature and evergreen foliage. Its botanical features make it a popular choice for ornamental landscaping in temperate climates."
