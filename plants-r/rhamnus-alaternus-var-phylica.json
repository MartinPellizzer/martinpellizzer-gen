    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus var. phylica, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its dark green, oval leaves that turn yellow in autumn, and its smooth, gray bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue-black berries that are rich in anthraquinones. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and rocky areas. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural landscapes."
