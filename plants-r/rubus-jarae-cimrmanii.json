    "intro": "Rubus jarae-cimrmanii, commonly known as the Jarae-Cimrmanii bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central America, particularly in countries like Guatemala and Honduras. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, compound leaves, and small, white to pinkish flowers. It produces edible berries that are similar to raspberries but are less commonly cultivated. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
