    "intro": "Rhynchosia rhombifolia var. timoriensis, commonly known as the Timor legume, is a flowering plant native to parts of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is a climbing legume characterized by its trifoliate leaves and small, yellowish-white flowers. The plant produces pod-like fruits that contain several seeds, which are often dispersed by wind or animals. It thrives in tropical and subtropical regions, typically in disturbed soils and open habitats. Due to its ornamental value and potential for nitrogen fixation, it is sometimes cultivated in agroforestry systems."
