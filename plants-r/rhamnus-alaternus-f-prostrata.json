    "intro": "Rhamnus alaternus f. prostrata, commonly known as the prostrate buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to southern Europe. It features small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically dark green and have a leathery texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by small, black berries that are edible but have astringent properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or arid environments. This form is a prostrate variant, meaning it grows close to the ground, making it suitable for ground cover in landscaping."
