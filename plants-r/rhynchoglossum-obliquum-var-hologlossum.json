    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum obliquum var. hologlossum, commonly known as the narrow-leaf pterostigma, is a perennial herb native to the wetlands of eastern North America. It features lanceolate leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs, giving them a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, showy flowers with distinctive blue or purple petals that are arranged in a dense spike. Its unique floral structure and habitat preferences make it an important species for wetland ecosystems. It is also valued for its role in supporting pollinator populations."
