    "intro": "Rinorea ramiziana, commonly known as the velvetleaf or red velvetleaf, is a tropical shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a dense, velvety pubescence, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its fruits are capsules that contain several small, elliptical seeds. Rinorea ramiziana is often found in moist, shaded environments and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
