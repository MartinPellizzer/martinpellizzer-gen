    "intro": "Roldana gentryi, commonly known as the Gentry's roldana, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Campanulaceae and is characterized by its bell-shaped, violet-blue flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, while its stems are slender and branching. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Roldana gentryi is considered endangered and is of particular interest to botanists and conservationists."
