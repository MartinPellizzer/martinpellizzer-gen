    "intro": "Rubus leptadenes, commonly known as the slenderleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit and produces small, dark berries. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. The berries are edible but are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry species."
