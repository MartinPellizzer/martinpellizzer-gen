It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, shaded environments. This fern-like shrub is often found in woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to local biodiversity."
