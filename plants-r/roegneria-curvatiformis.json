    "intro": "Roegneria curvatiformis, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and slender, arching blades that often form dense mats. The plant typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. Its inflorescence consists of a loose to dense cluster of spikelets, and it produces small, wind-pollinated flowers. Roegneria curvatiformis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping and turfgrass applications."
