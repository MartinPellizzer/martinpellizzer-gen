    "intro": "Racosperma pedleyi, commonly known as the Northern River Gum, is a small to medium-sized tree native to northern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The tree typically grows in riparian zones, often along rivers and floodplains, where it thrives in moist, alluvial soils. Its bark is rough and fissured, and it produces small, yellow flowers that attract nectar-feeding birds and insects. The species is valued for its ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for native wildlife."
