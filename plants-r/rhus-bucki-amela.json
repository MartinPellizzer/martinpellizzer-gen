    "intro": "Rhus bucki-amela, commonly known as the silky dogwood, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically gray-green in color with a silvery underside. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red or orange berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it adaptable to various soil types. Rhus bucki-amela is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in partial shade."
