    "intro": "Rubus bohemiicola, commonly known as Bohemian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and often overlooked member of the Rubus genus."
