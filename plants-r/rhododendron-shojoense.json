    "intro": "Rhododendron shojoense, commonly known as the Shikoku rhododendron, is a species native to Japan, specifically the Shikoku region. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in moist, acidic soils under shaded forest conditions. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink and white during the spring season. Its leaves are elliptical and have a leathery texture, which helps it retain moisture in its native environment. Rhododendron shojoense is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays a role in the local biodiversity of its habitat."
