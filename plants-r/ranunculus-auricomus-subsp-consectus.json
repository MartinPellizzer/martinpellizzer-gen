    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. consectus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petal-like sepals, often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are deeply lobed and have a distinctive, glossy appearance. The subspecies is characterized by its slightly different flower morphology compared to the typical *R. auricomus*."
