    "intro": "Reynoutria aubertii, commonly known as giant knotweed, is a vigorous perennial plant native to East Asia. It features thick, rhizomatous stems that can grow up to several meters in height, with large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating. The plant produces small, clustered white flowers in late summer, followed by dark, berry-like fruits. Its rapid growth and invasive potential make it a significant ecological concern in many regions. Botanically, it belongs to the family Polygonaceae and is closely related to other members of the knotweed genus."
