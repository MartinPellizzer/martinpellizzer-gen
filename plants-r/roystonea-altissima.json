    "intro": "Roystonea altissima, commonly known as the royal palm, is a tall, slender palm native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is characterized by its tall, unbranched trunk and large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers that develop into orange or red fruits, which are edible but not commonly consumed by humans. It thrives in tropical climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value and as a symbol of resilience. Roystonea altissima plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various wildlife species."
