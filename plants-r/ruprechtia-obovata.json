    "intro": "Ruprechtia obovata, commonly known as the broad-leafed ruprechtia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features lanceolate to obovate leaves that are often hairy and have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in loose clusters, which bloom in late summer. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense colonies in moist, shaded environments. Ruprechtia obovata is valued in horticulture for its ornamental foliage and ability to thrive in woodland gardens."
