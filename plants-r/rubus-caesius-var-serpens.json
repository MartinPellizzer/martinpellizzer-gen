It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
