    "intro": "Rubus retroflexus, commonly known as the booby apple or evergreen blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is a perennial shrub that produces small, dark red berries that are typically inedible due to their high acidity and astringent taste. The plant has compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its stems are covered in stiff, curved prickles. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. The plant plays a role in local ecosystems by providing shelter for small animals and insects."
