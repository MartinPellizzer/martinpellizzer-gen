    "intro": "Rosa austera, commonly known as the Austrian rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Central and Eastern Europe. It features simple, alternate leaves that are oval to elliptic in shape with serrated margins. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in clusters during late spring to early summer. Its stems are covered in thorns, and it has a woody structure that becomes more pronounced with age. Rosa austera is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in garden landscapes for its hardiness and adaptability."
