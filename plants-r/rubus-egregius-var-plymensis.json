    "intro": "Rubus egregius var. plymensis, commonly known as the Plymnesian raspberry, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of the British Isles. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces bright red, edible berries that are typically harvested in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in maritime climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species."
