    "intro": "Rhus insignis, commonly known as the Mexican buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a serrated margin. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by orange to red berries that are an important food source for wildlife. Rhus insignis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, rocky habitats. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to withstand drought conditions."
