    "intro": "Rosa canina globularis, commonly known as the globular rose, is a shrub-like plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, pink or white flowers that bloom in spring. The plant produces bright red, spherical fruits called hips, which are rich in vitamin C and used in traditional medicine. Its leaves are pinnate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in well-drained soils. Rosa canina globularis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and ecological benefits."
