    "intro": "Roettlera yunnanensis f. cleistogama, commonly known as the Yunnan cleistogamous roettlera, is a rare flowering plant belonging to the Gesneriaceae family. It is characterized by its unique cleistogamous (closed) flowers, which do not open and are self-fertile. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan Province in China, where it thrives in shaded, moist environments. Its foliage consists of ovate to elliptical leaves with a glossy surface. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical research and conservation efforts."
