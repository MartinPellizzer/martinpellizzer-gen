It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate yellow flowers with a distinctive white center. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as mountain forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with finely divided lobes, and it produces small, herbaceous stems. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject in botanical studies and conservation efforts."
