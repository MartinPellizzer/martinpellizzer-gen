    "intro": "Rosa tschatyrdagi var. schaemachensis, commonly known as the Karakoram rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the high altitudes of the Karakoram mountain range. It is characterized by its compact shrub form, with dark green, leathery leaves and fragrant, pale pink to white flowers. The plant exhibits a high degree of cold tolerance, adapted to the harsh climate of its alpine habitat. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer, adding a delicate beauty to the rugged landscape. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native region."
