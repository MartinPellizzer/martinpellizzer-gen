    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 orbessanea, commonly known as the double-flowered shrub rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa bracteata. It is characterized by its dense, thorned growth habit and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types, making it a hardy plant. The plant produces large, showy blooms with multiple layers of petals, often in shades of pink, red, or white. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and its ability to attract pollinators. Due to its vigorous growth, it can become invasive in certain regions if not properly managed."
