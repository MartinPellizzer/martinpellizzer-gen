    "intro": "Rhizophora conjugata, commonly known as the red mangrove, is a salt-tolerant tree found in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. It is characterized by its distinctive above-ground roots, called pneumatophores, which aid in respiration in waterlogged soil. The plant has small, simple leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle to reduce water loss. It produces small, yellowish flowers that are pollinated by wind or insects. Its fruits are buoyant, allowing the seeds to float and disperse in marine environments."
