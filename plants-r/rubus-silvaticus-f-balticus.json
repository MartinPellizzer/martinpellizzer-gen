    "intro": "Rubus silvaticus f. balticus, commonly known as the Baltic bramble, is a subspecies of the common blackberry. It is a perennial shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically smaller and more acidic than those of the parent species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forested areas across northern Europe. Its botanical features make it an important component of understory vegetation in temperate woodlands."
