    "intro": "Rosa canina f. sublongistyla, commonly known as the long-styled dogrose, is a botanical variant of the common dogrose. It is characterized by its elongated stamens and pistils, which distinguish it from the typical form of Rosa canina. This subspecies is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open woodlands and grassy areas. The flowers are usually pink to red, with five petals and numerous stamens. It produces hips, which are the fruit, and is valued for its ornamental qualities as well as its historical use in herbal medicine."
