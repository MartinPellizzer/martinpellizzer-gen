    "intro": "Rosa macrophylla var. arguta, commonly known as the Argutifolia rose, is a hybrid species native to the coastal regions of California and Oregon. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of fine, silvery hairs. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardy nature, it is a popular choice for garden cultivation in coastal climates."
