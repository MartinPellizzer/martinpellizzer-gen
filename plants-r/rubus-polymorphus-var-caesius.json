    "intro": "Rubus polymorphus var. caesius, commonly known as the purple-flowered bramble, is a perennial shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forests and along stream banks. Its flowers are notable for their deep purple color, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species."
