    "intro": "Ranunculus erodiifolius, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five sepals and no true petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and often have a waxy coating. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
