    "intro": "Rhynchospora capitellata var. discutiens, commonly known as the rough swamp sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in North America. It typically grows in marshy or swampy areas, where it thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually greenish or brownish in color. Its inflorescence is a dense, cylindrical spike that is often covered with short, rough hairs. This variety is distinguished by its distinctive leaf surface texture and its ecological role in wetland habitats."
