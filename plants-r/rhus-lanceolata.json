    "intro": "Rhus lanceolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern and central United States. It typically grows to a height of 6 to 15 feet and features compound leaves with 15 to 31 lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy fruits that contain one or two seeds. Rhus lanceolata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. Its rapid growth and ability to tolerate various soil conditions make it a common invasive species in some regions."
