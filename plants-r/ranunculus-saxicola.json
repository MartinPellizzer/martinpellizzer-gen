    "intro": "Ranunculus saxicola, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a small, herbaceous perennial plant native to alpine and arctic regions. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils, often in mountainous areas where conditions are harsh. The plant produces delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, and its leaves are palmately divided. It is adapted to cold climates and can survive in low-nutrient environments. Ranunculus saxicola plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitats and is sometimes cultivated for its ornamental value."
