    "intro": "Richterago stenophylla, commonly known as the narrow-leaved richardia, is a perennial herb native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that typically bloom in spring. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in cloud forests. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties. The species is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to high-altitude conditions."
