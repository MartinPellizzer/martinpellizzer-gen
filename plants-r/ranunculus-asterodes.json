    "intro": "Ranunculus asterodes, commonly known as the star flower or meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a basal rosette of finely divided, dark green leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, arranged in a star-like pattern, which bloom in early spring. It prefers moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Ranunculus asterodes is known for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate appearance."
