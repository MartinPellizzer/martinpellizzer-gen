    "intro": "Rudgea coriacea, commonly known as the roughleaf rudgea, is a flowering plant native to South America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias. The plant is characterized by its woody stems and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a rough texture, which helps it retain moisture in arid environments. Rudgea coriacea is typically found in dry forests and scrublands, where it thrives in well-drained soils."
