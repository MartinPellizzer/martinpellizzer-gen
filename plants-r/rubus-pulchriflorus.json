    "intro": "Rubus pulchriflorus, commonly known as the beautiful-flowered blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the fruit is typically dark purple when ripe. This plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
