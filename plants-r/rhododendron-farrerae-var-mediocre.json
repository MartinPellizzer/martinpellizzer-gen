    "intro": "Rhododendron farrerae var. mediocre, commonly known as the mediocre rhododendron, is a rare and less common variant of the rhododendron species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and relatively small, leathery leaves that are typically dark green in color. The flowers are usually pale pink to white, with a subtle fragrance, and bloom in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is often of interest to botanists and conservationists."
