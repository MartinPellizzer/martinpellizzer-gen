    "intro": "Ranunculus oreophytus var. lanuriensis, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of the Alps. It is characterized by its small, yellow, cup-shaped flowers and finely divided, lance-shaped leaves. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. It is a perennial species with a short growing season, blooming in late spring to early summer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
