    "intro": "Rosa naiadum, commonly known as the water rose, is a rare aquatic plant found in still freshwater habitats. It has delicate, floating leaves that are oval-shaped with a waxy surface to repel water. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators like bees and butterflies. Its roots are adapted to absorb nutrients from the water, and it plays a role in maintaining water quality. Due to its limited distribution, Rosa naiadum is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
