    "intro": "Rubus cordifolius affinis, commonly known as the heart-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are usually three to five leaflets, with the central leaflet being heart-shaped, giving the plant its common name. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The species is valued for its edible fruits and is sometimes cultivated for both ornamental and culinary purposes."
