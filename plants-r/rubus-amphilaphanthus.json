    "intro": "Rubus amphilaphanthus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and riparian habitats. Due to its size and aggressive growth, it can become invasive in certain areas."
