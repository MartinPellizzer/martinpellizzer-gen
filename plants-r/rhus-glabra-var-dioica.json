    "intro": "Rhus glabra var. dioica, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in dry, open woodlands or along roadsides. Its botanical features make it a valuable component of native plant communities and a popular ornamental plant."
