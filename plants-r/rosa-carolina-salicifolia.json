It features slender, willow-like leaves that are elongated and lance-shaped, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, which are borne in clusters at the ends of the stems. Its stems are often covered in fine, silvery hairs, contributing to its ornamental value. Rosa carolina salicifolia is well adapted to moist, woodland habitats and is often found in shaded areas."
