It belongs to the family Rytigyniaceae and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and lance-shaped leaves. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in montane forests. Its botanical features include a woody stem and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom during the wet season. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
