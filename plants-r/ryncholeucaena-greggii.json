It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically bright green and have a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, followed by flat, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a hardy species suitable for reclamation projects. Ryncholeucaena greggii is also valued for its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility in degraded lands."
