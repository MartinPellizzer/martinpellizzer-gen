    "intro": "Ranunculus karakoramicola, commonly known as the Karakoram buttercup, is a rare alpine plant native to the high mountain regions of the Karakoram range. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils at elevations above 3,000 meters, where it faces harsh environmental conditions. Its flowers are usually yellow or white, with five to eight petals, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native environment."
