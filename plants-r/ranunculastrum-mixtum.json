    "intro": "Ranunculastrum mixtum, commonly known as the mixed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of white, yellow, or orange, and is often found in moist meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. Its reproductive system relies on insect pollination, and it produces small, three-lobed fruits containing several seeds. Ranunculastrum mixtum is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
