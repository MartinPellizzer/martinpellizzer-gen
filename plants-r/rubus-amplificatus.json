    "intro": "Rubus amplificatus, commonly known as the broadleaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces edible berries that are similar in taste to raspberries but are often larger and more robust. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important part of local ecosystems and a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
