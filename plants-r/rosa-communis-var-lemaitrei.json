It is characterized by its deep pink, semi-double flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
