    "intro": "Rechsteineria ignea var. loefgrenii, commonly known as the flame orchid, is a striking epiphytic orchid native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It is characterized by its vibrant red and orange flowers, which resemble flames, and its unique, spiral-shaped inflorescence. The plant typically grows on trees or rocks, anchoring itself with its pseudobulbs and producing aerial roots for nutrient absorption. Its flowers bloom during the warmer months, attracting pollinators such as birds and insects. Due to its ornamental value and rarity, it is often cultivated in specialized horticultural settings."
