    "intro": "Roraimaea, commonly known as the Roraima fern, is a unique plant native to the tepuis of Venezuela and Brazil. It belongs to the genus Pteris and is characterized by its delicate, feather-like fronds. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in rocky crevices. Its spores are dispersed by wind, allowing it to colonize new areas. Due to its restricted habitat, Roraimaea is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
