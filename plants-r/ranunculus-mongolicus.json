    "intro": "Ranunculus mongolicus, commonly known as the Mongolian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, palmate leaves and showy yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in alpine and subalpine habitats, thriving in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often found at elevations above 2,000 meters, where it withstands cold temperatures and high UV radiation. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
