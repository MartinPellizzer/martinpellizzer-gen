It is characterized by its dark, thorny stems and compound leaves that often have a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
