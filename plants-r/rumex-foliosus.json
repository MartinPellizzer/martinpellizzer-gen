    "intro": "Rumex foliosus, commonly known as narrow-leaved sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and along stream banks. The plant features upright, hairy stems and alternate, lanceolate leaves with a reddish underside. Its small, greenish flowers are arranged in dense clusters and are borne on terminal spikes. Rumex foliosus is known for its sour-tasting leaves, which contain high levels of oxalic acid."
