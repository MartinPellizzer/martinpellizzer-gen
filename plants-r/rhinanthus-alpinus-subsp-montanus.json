It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is typically found in alpine and subalpine habitats, growing in open, rocky or gravelly areas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients. Its distribution includes parts of Europe and Asia, where it thrives in high-altitude environments."
