    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. purpurascens, commonly known as the purpleleaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark green, elliptical leaves that turn a striking purplish-red in the autumn. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in late spring, followed by red, aggregate fruits known as berries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and ecological benefits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
