It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and flowers that are typically pink to red in color. The plant is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and is adapted to cold, arid climates. It produces large, edible rose hips that are used in traditional medicine and culinary applications. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically valuable species."
