    "intro": "Rubus riparius, commonly known as the waterberry or river blackberry, is a shrub native to wetland and riparian habitats. It is characterized by its trailing or climbing growth habit, with thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along streams, rivers, and marshes. Rubus riparius plays an important ecological role by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing shoreline vegetation."
