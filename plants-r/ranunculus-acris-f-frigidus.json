    "intro": "Ranunculus acris f. frigidus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a botanical variant of the common buttercup. It is characterized by its smaller, more delicate flowers and shorter, stiffer stems compared to the typical form. This subspecies is adapted to cooler, high-altitude environments, often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Its leaves are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers with five petals, blooming in early summer."
