    "intro": "Rosa malyi var. leiocalyx, commonly known as the Yunnan mountain rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to China. It is characterized by its dense, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant features glossy, dark green leaves with serrated edges, and its growth habit is typically compact and bushy. It prefers well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is highly valued in horticultural collections."
