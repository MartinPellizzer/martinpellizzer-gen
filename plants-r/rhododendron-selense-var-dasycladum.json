    "intro": "Rhododendron selense var. dasycladum, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central America. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to deep red. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is typically found in forest understories where it receives partial shade. Its leaves are leathery and have a distinctive, compact growth habit, which helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a valuable species for botanical study and conservation efforts."
