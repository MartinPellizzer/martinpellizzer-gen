    "intro": "Rhododendron concinnum var. pseudoyanthinum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features dense, leathery foliage with dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in subalpine and alpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists alike."
