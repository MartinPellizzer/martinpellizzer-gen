    "intro": "Reaumuria alternifolia subsp. alternifolia, commonly known as the alternateleaf sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of central Asia. It features woody stems covered in dense, white to grayish pubescence, which helps reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, narrow, and often covered with fine hairs, contributing to its drought tolerance. This subspecies is well adapted to sandy soils and can thrive in regions with limited rainfall."
