    "intro": "Robinia pseudoacacia var. sophorifolia, commonly known as the black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive grayish-green color. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clustered inflorescences, typically in late spring. Its bark is thick, fissured, and dark brown, while its wood is strong and durable. This variety is closely related to the common Robinia pseudoacacia but exhibits subtle differences in morphology and habitat preference."
