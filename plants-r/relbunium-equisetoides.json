    "intro": "Relbunium equisetoides, commonly known as the slender clubmoss, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of East Asia. It belongs to the family Lycopodiaceae and is characterized by its compact, dense growth habit and small, scale-like leaves. The plant produces spore-bearing cones, typical of its ancient lineage, and thrives in moist, shaded environments. It is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental appeal in horticulture. Due to its slow growth and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and delicate species."
