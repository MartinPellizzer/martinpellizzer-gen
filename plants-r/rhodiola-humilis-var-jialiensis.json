    "intro": "Rhodiola humilis var. jialiensis, commonly known as the Jialing rhodiola, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the Crassulaceae family and is characterized by its fleshy, succulent leaves and small, pinkish-white flowers. The plant is adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cold, rocky soils with limited nutrients. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread slowly and form dense mats. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
