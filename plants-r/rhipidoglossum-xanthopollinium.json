    "intro": "Rhipidoglossum xanthopollinium, commonly known as the golden-pollen lichen, is a rare and specialized lichen species that exhibits unique botanical characteristics. It belongs to the family Parmeliaceae and is characterized by its dense, crust-like thallus that adheres tightly to rock surfaces. The lichen's distinctive yellowish to orange-colored medulla is a key feature, contributing to its common name. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found on calcareous substrates in temperate regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a sensitive indicator of environmental health."
