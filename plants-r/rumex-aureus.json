    "intro": "Rumex aureus, commonly known as golden dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, giving them a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its leaves are typically harvested for use in herbal remedies due to their astringent properties. Rumex aureus thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along riverbanks and in wet meadows."
