It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often variegated with white and green. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers that are clustered in umbels, typical of its family. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens, though it requires careful management to prevent it from becoming invasive."
