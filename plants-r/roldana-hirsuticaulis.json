It is characterized by its hairy, cylindrical stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom during the spring and early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in mountainous regions with high humidity. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
