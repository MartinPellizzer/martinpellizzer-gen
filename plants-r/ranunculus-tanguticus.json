    "intro": "Ranunculus tanguticus, commonly known as the Tibetan buttercup, is a perennial herb native to the high altitudes of Tibet and adjacent regions. It features a short, rhizomatous rootstock and produces delicate, showy flowers with five to eight yellow petals and a greenish center. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in fine hairs, while the stems are hairy and erect. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
