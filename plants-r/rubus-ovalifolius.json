It is characterized by its woody stems, which are typically thorny and can grow up to several meters in length. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are oval in shape with serrated edges and a slightly hairy surface. Rubus ovalifolius thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas or along streambanks."
