    "intro": "Ranunculus maelbyensis, commonly known as Maelby's buttercup, is a rare and endangered species native to specific regions of Scandinavia. It is a herbaceous perennial plant characterized by its delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or heathland habitats. Its leaves are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are slender and often branched. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, conservation efforts are crucial for its survival."
