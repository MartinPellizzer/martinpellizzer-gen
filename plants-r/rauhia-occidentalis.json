    "intro": "Rauhia occidentalis, commonly known as the western rauhia, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the western United States. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and small, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in its harsh environment. The plant produces clusters of pale yellow to white flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is deep and extensive, allowing it to access groundwater in dry conditions. Rauhia occidentalis plays a vital role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators in its ecosystem."
