    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. tiranensis, commonly known as the Tiranese woolly rose, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of southern China. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (fuzzy) foliage and small, pale pink flowers. The plant thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous areas with well-drained soil. Its leaves are typically oval-shaped with serrated edges, and it produces rose-like flowers that bloom in late spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
