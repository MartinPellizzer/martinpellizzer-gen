    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 pseudobscurus, commonly known as the blackberry bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It is native to the eastern United States and thrives in moist, wooded areas. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in jams and pies. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a complex root system that helps stabilize soil. Due to its adaptability, it is both a valued ornamental plant and an invasive species in some regions."
