    "intro": "Rhinanthus lanceolatus, commonly known as the lanceolate yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, commonly known as the broomrape family, and is characterized by its lack of chlorophyll, making it a hemiparasitic plant. The plant produces showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. It thrives in grasslands and open habitats, often found in association with other wildflowers. Its seeds are dispersed by wind, contributing to its distribution across various habitats."
