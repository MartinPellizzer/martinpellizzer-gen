    "intro": "Rumex fraternus, commonly known as the common dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa. It features a robust, upright stem with alternate, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by oval, reddish-brown seeds. Rumex fraternus is known for its ability to thrive in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. It has been used historically for its medicinal properties and as a source of leafy greens."
