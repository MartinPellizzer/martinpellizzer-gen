    "intro": "Rhopalocarpus louvelii var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaved louvel's rhopalocarpus, is a rare and endemic plant species native to Madagascar. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its compact growth habit. The plant features small, ovate leaves with a smooth texture and pale green coloration. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, round fruits that contain several seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes and habitat loss."
