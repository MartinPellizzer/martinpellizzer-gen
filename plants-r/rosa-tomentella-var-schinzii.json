    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. schinzii, commonly known as the Schinz's woolly rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white tomentum, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
