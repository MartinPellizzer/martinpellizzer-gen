    "intro": "Romulea diluta, commonly known as the pale bulbous orchid, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its compact, bulb-like structure that stores nutrients. The plant produces delicate, pale yellow to greenish flowers with a distinctive spurred shape. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny habitats. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, Romulea diluta is a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
