    "intro": "Racinaea pattersoniae, commonly known as the Patterson's racinaea, is a rare and unique fern native to the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Osmundaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, spirally arranged fronds that are typically dark green and leathery in texture. The plant exhibits a creeping growth habit, with rhizomes that help it spread across the forest floor. Its reproductive structures, including sporangia, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many fern species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Racinaea pattersoniae is considered a species of conservation concern."
