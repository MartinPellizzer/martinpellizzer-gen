    "intro": "Roupalia, commonly known as the mountain cedar, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Rupbiaceae. It consists of several species, primarily found in arid and semi-arid regions of Africa, Asia, and Australia. The plants are shrubs or small trees, often characterized by their small, leathery leaves and clusters of small, white or yellow flowers. Roupalia species are adapted to harsh environments, showing resilience to drought and poor soil conditions. They play a role in local ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various insects and small animals."
