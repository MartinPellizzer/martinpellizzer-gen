    "intro": "Ranunculus froedinii, commonly known as the Froedin's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features palmately divided leaves with a hairy texture, and it thrives in well-drained, rocky soils. Ranunculus froedinii is a perennial species that blooms in early spring, adding a vibrant touch to alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its native range."
