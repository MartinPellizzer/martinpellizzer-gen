    "intro": "Rubus comatulus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pinkish flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture. Rubus comatulus thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
