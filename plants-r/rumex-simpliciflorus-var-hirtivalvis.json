    "intro": "Rumex simpliciflorus var. hirtivalvis, commonly known as hairy-stemmed sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of North America. It features upright, hairy stems that are often reddish in color, and it produces small, greenish-white flowers clustered in dense, terminal spikes. The leaves are heart-shaped with a distinctive waxy coating and have a sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed sites. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
