    "intro": "Ranunculus serpens subsp. serpens, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It features a sprawling growth habit with rhizomatous stems that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are deeply lobed and often have a hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, stream banks, and woodland edges."
