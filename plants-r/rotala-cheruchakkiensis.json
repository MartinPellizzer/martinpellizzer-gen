    "intro": "Rotala cheruchakkiensis, commonly known as the Indian waterwheel plant, is a species of aquatic plant native to the wetlands of southern India. It features whorled leaves that are typically bright green and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences, adding ornamental value to its habitat. It thrives in shallow water and is often found in ponds and slow-moving streams. Its adaptability to various water conditions makes it a popular choice for water gardeners and ecological restoration projects."
