    "intro": "Rhododendron rotundifolium, commonly known as the roundleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its broad, rounded leaves and dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other shrubs and evergreens. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be challenging to grow outside its native habitat."
