    "intro": "Ranunculus dactylophylloides, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a species of flowering plant in the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, oval-shaped leaves and its yellow, five-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant is native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its root system is fibrous and adapted for anchoring in soil while absorbing nutrients. The plant contains toxic compounds, including protoanemonin, which can cause skin irritation upon contact."
