    "intro": "Ranunculus batrachioides, commonly known as the frog's-bit, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in shallow water or moist soils, often near ponds, ditches, and wet meadows. The plant has bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens, giving it a delicate, star-shaped appearance. Its leaves are usually divided into three parts, and the plant is often found in association with other water plants. Ranunculus batrachioides is known for its rapid growth and ability to spread through both seeds and vegetative reproduction."
