    "intro": "Rhus glaucescens var. collina, commonly known as the coastal prickly ash, is a shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its small, yellowish-green leaves and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, red, berry-like fruits that are edible for some wildlife but toxic to humans. It thrives in sandy or coastal soils and is often found in dunes or along the edges of wetlands. Its adaptability to salt spray and wind makes it an important plant in coastal ecosystems."
