    "intro": "Rhynchospora ptaritepuiana, commonly known as the New Zealand swamp ryegrass, is a perennial grass species native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often grow in wet or marshy environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny flowers, which are typically greenish or brownish in color. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, with a rough texture, and it thrives in poorly drained soils. Rhynchospora ptaritepuiana plays a role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems and is of interest in ecological and botanical studies."
