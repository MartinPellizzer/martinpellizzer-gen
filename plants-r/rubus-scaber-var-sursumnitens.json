    "intro": "Rubus scaber var. sursumnitens, commonly known as the upland raspberry. This variant is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central America, characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a sweet and tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or disturbed habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
