    "intro": "Randia plumbea, commonly known as the leadplant or silverleaf randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters. The plant features opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery or grayish pubescence. Its small, white or pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, round, smooth fruits that are typically green when mature. Randia plumbea is often found in disturbed soils and is used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
