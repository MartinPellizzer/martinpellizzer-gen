    "intro": "Rumex angiocarpus var. communis, commonly known as sour dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features broad, wavy, and often reddish leaves with a distinctive sour taste due to its high concentration of oxalic acid. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, making it a common weed in cultivated areas. The plant is also valued for its medicinal properties, though its use is limited due to potential toxicity."
