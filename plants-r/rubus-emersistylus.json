    "intro": "Rubus emersistylus, commonly known as the narrowleaf blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, dark berries that ripen in late summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its flowers are typically white or pale pink, and it plays a role in supporting local pollinators and wildlife. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
