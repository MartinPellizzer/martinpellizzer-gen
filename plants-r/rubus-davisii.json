It is native to the western United States, particularly California, and is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a high concentration of antioxidants. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural reserves."
