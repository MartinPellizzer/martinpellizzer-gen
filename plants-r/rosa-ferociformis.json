    "intro": "Rosa ferociformis, commonly known as the fierce-form rose, is a rare and striking species native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its large, deep pink flowers with a distinctive, almost jagged petal shape. The plant has a woody stem and produces thorny growths, which help it defend against herbivores in its harsh environment. Its leaves are dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in arid conditions. Rosa ferociformis is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in specialized botanical gardens."
