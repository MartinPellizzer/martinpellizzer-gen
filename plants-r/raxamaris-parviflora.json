    "intro": "Raxamaris parviflora, commonly known as the silverleaf bellflower, is a perennial herb native to the temperate regions of southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems covered in a fine, silvery down that reflects sunlight. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of blue and violet, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and have a slightly hairy texture, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Raxamaris parviflora thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats."
