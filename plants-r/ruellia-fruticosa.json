The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Ruellia fruticosa is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
