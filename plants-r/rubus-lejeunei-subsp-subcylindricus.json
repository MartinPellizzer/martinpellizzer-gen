    "intro": "Rubus lejeunei subsp. subcylindricus, commonly known as the narrow-stemmed blackberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, cylindrical stems that are often covered in fine, white hairs. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a serrated margin, with a dark green upper surface and a lighter underside. Its flowers are small, white, and clustered in terminal umbels, while the fruit is a aggregate of small, dark purple drupes. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible berries."
