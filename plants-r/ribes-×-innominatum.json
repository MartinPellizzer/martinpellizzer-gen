    "intro": "Ribes \u00d7 innominatum, commonly known as the hybrid gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Saxifragaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Ribes aureum (golden gooseberry) and Ribes hirtellum (Boeing gooseberry), resulting in a plant with distinctive botanical features. The leaves are broadly ovate to elliptic, with serrated edges and a hairy surface, especially on the underside. Its flowers are yellow, five-petaled, and appear in clusters, while the fruit is a small, yellow to orange berry that ripens in late summer. This plant is often found in moist, shady areas and is valued for its ornamental appeal and potential culinary use."
