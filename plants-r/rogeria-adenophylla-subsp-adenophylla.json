    "intro": "Rogeria adenophylla subsp. adenophylla, commonly known as the woolly rogeria, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of white to grayish hairs on its stems and leaves, which provide insulation and protection against environmental stress. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded or partially shaded woodland areas. Due to its ornamental value and unique appearance, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
