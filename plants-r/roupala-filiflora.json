    "intro": "Roupala filiflora, commonly known as the silky tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, greyish-brown bark and its striking, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, almost silky appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are clustered in panicles, followed by spherical, woody fruits. It thrives in tropical and subtropical climates, preferring well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in gardens and as a street tree in urban landscapes."
