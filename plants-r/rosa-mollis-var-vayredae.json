    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. vayredae, commonly known as the Vayreda rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of central Chile. It features dense, thornless stems covered in soft, velvety gray-green foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers with a subtle pinkish tinge, which bloom in late winter to early spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or containers. Due to its limited distribution and unique characteristics, it is considered a rare and valuable addition to botanical collections."
