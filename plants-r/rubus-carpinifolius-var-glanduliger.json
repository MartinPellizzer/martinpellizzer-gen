It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically edible but have a tart flavor. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, often attracting pollinators such as bees. The variety is distinguished by the presence of glandular structures on its leaves and stems, which contribute to its unique botanical features."
