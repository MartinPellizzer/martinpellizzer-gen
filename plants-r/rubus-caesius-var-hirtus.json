    "intro": "Rubus caesius var. hirtus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its densely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other blackberry varieties. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. The hairy blackberry is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
