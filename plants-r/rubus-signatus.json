    "intro": "Rubus signatus, commonly known as the signatory raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, containing multiple tiny seeds. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated and have a distinctive appearance. Rubus signatus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
