    "intro": "Rosa hirta var. peracuta, commonly known as the prickly rose, is a flowering plant native to parts of Africa and the Middle East. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky environments and is well adapted to arid conditions. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, providing some protection against water loss. The fruit is a red, hairy rose hip that contains seeds and is often used in traditional medicine."
