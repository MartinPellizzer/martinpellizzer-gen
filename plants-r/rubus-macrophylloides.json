    "intro": "Rubus macrophylloides, commonly known as the large-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and prickly stems, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when ripe. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
