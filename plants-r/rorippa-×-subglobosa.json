    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 subglobosa, commonly known as the globe watercress, is a hybrid aquatic plant that thrives in shallow, freshwater environments. It is characterized by its compact, rounded growth habit and small, rounded leaves that are typically submerged or floating. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in racemes, which bloom from mid-summer to early autumn. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the substrate in wetland habitats. Rorippa \u00d7 subglobosa is often found in ponds, ditches, and slow-moving streams, where it plays a role in aquatic ecosystem dynamics."
