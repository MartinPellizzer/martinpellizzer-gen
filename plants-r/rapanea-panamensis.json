    "intro": "Rapanea panamensis, commonly known as the Panamanian waxtree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the tropical regions of Central America. It belongs to the family Lauraceae, which includes laurels, and is characterized by its aromatic leaves and small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in humid, shaded environments, such as mountain forests, where it thrives in the understory. Its leaves are thick and leathery, often with a waxy coating, and its fruit is a small, fleshy drupe that attracts various bird species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
