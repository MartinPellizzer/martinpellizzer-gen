It is characterized by its woody stems and small, green, ovate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers followed by distinctive, hairy, woody fruits that are typically elliptical in shape. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or heathlands. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and ecologists studying Australian flora."
