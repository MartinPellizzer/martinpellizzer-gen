    "intro": "Rumex baehnii, commonly known as broadleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features large, broad, heart-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a distinctive white or pale-colored waxy coating. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on tall, slender flowering stems. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides, streambanks, and in meadows. Rumex baehnii is known for its strong, somewhat bitter taste and has been used historically in traditional medicine."
