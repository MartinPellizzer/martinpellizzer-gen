    "intro": "Ranunculus peninsularis, commonly known as the Peninsular buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the Iberian Peninsula. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with prominent, showy sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in woodland or grassland habitats. It blooms from late spring to early summer, producing small, cup-shaped flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
