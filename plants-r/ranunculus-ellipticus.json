It features bright yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often with a dark center, and is typically found in moist, calcareous soils. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are elliptic in shape, with serrated edges. It blooms from late spring to early summer and is often found in meadows, along stream banks, and in woodland edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is also cultivated in gardens."
