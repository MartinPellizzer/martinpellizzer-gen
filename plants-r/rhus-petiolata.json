    "intro": "Rhus petiolata, commonly known as the narrowleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and consist of 5 to 11 narrow, lance-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that mature in the fall. Rhus petiolata thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woods, fields, and along roadsides. Its botanical features make it an important component of native plant communities and a valuable species for ecological restoration projects."
