    "intro": "Rhynchosia fischeri, commonly known as the Fischer's burrbean, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and distinctive pod-like fruits. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by hairy, spiny pods that enclose its seeds. Rhynchosia fischeri is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open woodlands, where it thrives in full sun. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it an important plant in soil enrichment and ecological restoration efforts."
