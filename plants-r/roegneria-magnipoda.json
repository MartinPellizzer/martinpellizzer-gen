It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and long, narrow leaves that are typically blue-green in color. The plant produces dense, spike-like inflorescences that bear small, two-lobed spikelets. Roegneria magnipoda is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often used in landscaping and erosion control. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
