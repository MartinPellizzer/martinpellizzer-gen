It is characterized by its slender, needle-like leaves and clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
