    "intro": "Racosperma obovatum, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It is a shrub or small tree that typically grows in dry, sandy soils. The plant produces yellow flowers in globular heads, which are characteristic of the Acacia genus. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several small, obovate leaflets. Racosperma obovatum is often used in revegetation projects due to its hardiness and ability to stabilize soil."
