    "intro": "Rubus myricae var. sieberi, commonly known as the Sieber's blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and dense clusters of dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring well-drained soils and cooler climates. Its leaves are elliptical with serrated edges, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in the axils of the leaves. The berries are edible when ripe, though they are often tart and require sweetening before consumption."
