    "intro": "Rumicastrum spergularinum, commonly known as the coastal bladderwrack, is a member of the family Fucaceae and is typically found in intertidal zones along rocky shores. It is a brown seaweed that grows in dense, bushy mats, often attaching itself to rocks with a holdfast. The plant has a distinctive structure with a stipe and a blade, and its surface is covered in small, bladder-like air bladders that help it float. It thrives in cold, temperate waters and is often found in areas with high wave action. This species plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various marine organisms."
