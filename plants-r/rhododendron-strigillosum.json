    "intro": "Rhododendron strigillosum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features dense clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink to purple, often in the spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and covered with a fine, silvery down, giving it a distinctive appearance. Rhododendron strigillosum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
