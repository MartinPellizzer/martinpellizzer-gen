    "intro": "Rhodophiala, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae. It is native to South America, particularly in regions of Brazil, Bolivia, and Peru. The plant is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that are typically golden yellow or orange in color. Rhodophiala species are epiphytic, meaning they grow on the surfaces of other plants without being parasitic. These orchids thrive in humid, shaded environments and are often found in cloud forests."
