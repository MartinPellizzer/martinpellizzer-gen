    "intro": "Rhododendron serpyllifolium, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of East Asia. It features dense, dark green foliage that is typically covered with a fine, silvery-white bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to purple, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded, moist woodland environments. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
