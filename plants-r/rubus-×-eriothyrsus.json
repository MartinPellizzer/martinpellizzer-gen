    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 eriothyrsus, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between the bramble Rubus ursinus and the evergreen Rubus pectoralis. It is native to coastal regions of southern California and Baja California, where it thrives in sandy soils and coastal climates. The plant is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, leathery leaves. Its fruit, a small, dark purple to black berry, is edible and has a tart flavor. It plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing dunes."
