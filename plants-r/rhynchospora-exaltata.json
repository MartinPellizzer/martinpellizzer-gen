It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and other grass-like plants. The plant features slender, grass-like stems that grow upright, with small, clustered flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, often with a waxy coating to reduce water loss.
