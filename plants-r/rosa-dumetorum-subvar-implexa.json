    "intro": "Rosa dumetorum subvar. implexa, commonly known as the creeping wild rose, is a low-growing shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It features slender, often prostrate stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven elliptical leaflets with serrated edges. This subspecies is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along roadsides."
