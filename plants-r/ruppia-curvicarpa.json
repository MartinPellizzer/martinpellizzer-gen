    "intro": "Ruppia curvicarpa, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to brackish and saline aquatic environments. It is typically found in coastal wetlands, estuaries, and shallow marine areas where it thrives in high salinity conditions. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves that are often submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in early spring. Its roots form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. Ruppia curvicarpa plays an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by contributing to water filtration and supporting local biodiversity."
