    "intro": "Ranunculus podocarpus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are often tinged with silver or white. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to rocky or alpine soils. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
