It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with finely serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
