    "intro": "Rhododendron microleucum, commonly known as the white rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, including China, Korea, and Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, humid conditions. Its leaves are leathery and elliptical, and the flowers have five petals that are usually smaller than those of other rhododendron species. Rhododendron microleucum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with appropriate growing conditions."
