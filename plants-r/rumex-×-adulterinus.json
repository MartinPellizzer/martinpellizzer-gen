    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 adulterinus, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (greater sorrel). It is a perennial herbaceous plant characterized by its distinctive heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along stream banks. Its leaves are edible but contain oxalic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities."
