    "intro": "Rostellaria rotundifolia, commonly known as the round-leaf rostellaria, is a rare and delicate orchid species native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its small, oval-shaped leaves and intricate, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in late summer. The plant prefers shaded, moist environments and is often found in tropical rainforests. Its roots are specialized for nutrient absorption in nutrient-poor soils. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
