    "intro": "Rubus hypochlorus, commonly known as the white-bracted raspberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, hairy fruits in the summer. Its fruits are edible but have a tart flavor and are often used in jams and preserves. The plant thrives in moist, wooded areas and is an important part of the local ecosystem."
