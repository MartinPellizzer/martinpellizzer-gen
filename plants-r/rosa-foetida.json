    "intro": "Rosa foetida, commonly known as the stinking rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the spring, though the scent is often described as unpleasant or even offensive. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of hairs. The plant is adapted to cold, arid environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
