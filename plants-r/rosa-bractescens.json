    "intro": "Rosa bractescens, commonly known as the Mexican moonflower, is a species of climbing shrub native to Mexico and Central America. It is characterized by its large, fragrant, white flowers that open at night, making it a nocturnal bloom. The plant has pinnately compound leaves with small, rounded leaflets and produces showy, bract-like structures that resemble petals. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often cultivated for its ornamental value. The flowers emit a sweet scent that attracts nocturnal pollinators such as moths."
