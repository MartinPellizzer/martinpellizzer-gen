    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 advenigena, commonly known as the common sorrel hybrid, is a perennial plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leafed sorrel). The plant typically features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish or purple coloration on the veins, and it produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters. It is often found in moist, disturbed soils and is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings. Its botanical characteristics make it distinct from its parent species, showcasing genetic variability in morphology and coloration."
