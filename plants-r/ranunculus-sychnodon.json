    "intro": "Ranunculus sychnodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features bright yellow flowers with 5 to 15 petals, and its leaves are deeply lobed with a distinctive, almost fern-like appearance. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. Ranunculus sychnodon is often cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value, though care must be taken due to its potentially irritating properties."
