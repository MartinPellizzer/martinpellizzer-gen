    "intro": "Rockhausenia graminifolia, commonly known as the grassy rockhausenia, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Asteraceae. It is characterized by its basal rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, inconspicuous yellow flowers arranged in a composite head. This plant is typically found in rocky or sandy soils in arid or semi-arid environments. It has a low-growing habit and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance. Rockhausenia graminifolia is native to regions of southern Africa, particularly South Africa."
