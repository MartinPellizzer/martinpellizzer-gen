It features succulent, fleshy leaves that are typically arranged in a rosette pattern, adapted to retain moisture in dry environments. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are followed by red, berry-like fruits. Its leaves are often used in traditional medicine for their astringent properties. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular ornamental plant in gardens."
