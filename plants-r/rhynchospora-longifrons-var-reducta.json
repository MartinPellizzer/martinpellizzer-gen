    "intro": "Rhynchospora longifrons var. reducta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved beakgrass, is a flowering plant belonging to the Cyperaceae family. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves. The inflorescence consists of a dense cluster of small, spike-like flower clusters. It typically grows in wetland or marshy habitats, preferring moist, nutrient-poor soils. This variety is distinguished by its reduced leaf morphology compared to the typical form of Rhynchospora longifrons."
