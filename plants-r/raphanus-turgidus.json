    "intro": "Raphanus turgidus, commonly known as the wild radish, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of pinnately lobed leaves and a flowering stem that bears small, yellow, cruciform flowers. The plant produces pods that contain several round, edible seeds. It is native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia, and it thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats. Raphanus turgidus is often considered a weed but has historical uses in traditional medicine and cuisine."
