    "intro": "[WRONG START] Rubus edwoodii, commonly known as Edward's blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is adapted to the cool, temperate climate of its native region. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
