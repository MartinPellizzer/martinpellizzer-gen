    "intro": "Rhinanthus glaber subsp. minor, commonly known as the lesser yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of host plants while photosynthesizing on its own. This subspecies is typically found in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with a distinctive tubular shape and a bilabiate corolla. It plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
