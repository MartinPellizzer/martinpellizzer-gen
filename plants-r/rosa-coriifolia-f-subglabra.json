It features fragrant, single or semi-double pink flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are ovate to elliptic, with a smooth, glabrous surface, distinguishing it from the typical form of Rosa coriifolia. It has a dense, bushy growth habit and is often used in ornamental gardening for its attractive foliage and flowers. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions."
