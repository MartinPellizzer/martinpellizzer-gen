    "intro": "Ruellia radiciflora, commonly known as the root-flower ruellia, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are usually hairy. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom from spring to summer. Ruellia radiciflora thrives in well-drained soil and prefers partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. Its rapid growth and ability to spread via rhizomes make it both a valuable garden plant and a potential weed in some environments."
