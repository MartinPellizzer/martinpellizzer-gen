    "intro": "Rhigiocarya chevalieri, commonly known as the Corsican hornbeam, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It belongs to the family Betulaceae and is characterized by its small, ovate leaves and smooth, gray bark. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in catkins, followed by winged fruits that aid in seed dispersal. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or coastal areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
