    "intro": "Rhododendron obtusum, commonly known as the broadleaf rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It is characterized by its large, leathery, ovate leaves that are typically dark green and often have a waxy coating. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and bloom in late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full shade. Rhododendron obtusum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens and woodland settings."
