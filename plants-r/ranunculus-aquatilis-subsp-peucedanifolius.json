    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subsp. peucedanifolius, commonly known as the water buttercup subspecies peucedanifolius, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of ponds and streams. The plant features slender, often floating stems with palmately divided, bright green leaves that are usually submerged or floating. Its flowers are yellow with brown or black markings, and they bloom in late spring to early summer. This subspecies is characterized by its distinctive leaf morphology, which resembles that of the herb peucedanum, giving it its specific epithet."
