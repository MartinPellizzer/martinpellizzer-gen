The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers that are clustered in cymes, and its fruits are berries that contain several seeds. Rauvolfia lamarckii is known for its medicinal properties, particularly due to the presence of alkaloids in its roots. It is often used in traditional medicine for its hypotensive effects."
