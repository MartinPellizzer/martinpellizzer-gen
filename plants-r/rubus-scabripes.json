    "intro": "Rubus scabripes, commonly known as roughleaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by red, raspberry-like fruits. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its rugged appearance and edible fruits, it is both ecologically and historically significant."
