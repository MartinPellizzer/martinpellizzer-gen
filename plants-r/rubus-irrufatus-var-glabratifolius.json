    "intro": "Rubus irrufatus var. glabratifolius, commonly known as the smooth-leafed bramble, is a variant of the trailing blackberry species native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glabrous (smooth) foliage, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant typically grows as a low, sprawling shrub with thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits. Its leaves are ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth texture and a slightly serrated margin. This variant is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and thickets."
