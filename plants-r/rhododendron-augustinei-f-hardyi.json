    "intro": "Rhododendron augustinei f. hardyi, commonly known as the Hardy's rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Yunnan, China. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its hardiness allows it to withstand colder temperatures compared to other rhododendron species. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
