    "intro": "Rubus caesius f. sterilis, commonly known as the sterile blackberry, is a cultivar of the blackberry plant characterized by its inability to produce viable seeds. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and sweeter than those of its fertile counterparts. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and fruit quality in gardens and agricultural settings. Due to its sterile nature, it relies on vegetative propagation for propagation."
