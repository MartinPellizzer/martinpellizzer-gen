    "intro": "Ranunculus fluitans subsp. bachii, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating leaves that are typically heart-shaped and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and marshes. Its presence often indicates good water quality due to its sensitivity to pollution."
