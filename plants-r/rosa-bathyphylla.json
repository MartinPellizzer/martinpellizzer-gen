    "intro": "Rosa bathyphylla, commonly known as the deep-sea rose, is a unique species of flowering plant found in deep ocean environments. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, pinkish flowers that bloom in low-light conditions. The plant thrives in cold, deep waters and is adapted to withstand high pressure and minimal nutrients. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with certain bacteria, aiding in nutrient absorption. Due to its extreme habitat, it is rarely studied and remains a subject of scientific interest."
