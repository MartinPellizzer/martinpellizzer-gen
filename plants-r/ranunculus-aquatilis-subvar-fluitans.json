    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis subvar. fluitans, commonly known as the floating water crowfoot, is a aquatic plant native to freshwater environments in Europe and Asia. It thrives in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds, lakes, and wetlands, where it floats on the water surface. The plant has small, delicate green leaves that are arranged in a whorled pattern around the stem, and its bright yellow flowers bloom in early spring. Its roots are anchored to the substrate, while its stems and leaves remain buoyant. This species plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
