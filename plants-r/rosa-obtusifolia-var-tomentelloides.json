    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia var. tomentelloides, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, fuzzy foliage and small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and is often used in rock gardens or as a decorative hedge. Its leaves are oval-shaped and covered in a fine, woolly coating, which helps to retain moisture in arid conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
