    "intro": "Roxburghia viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered roxburghia, is a tropical evergreen tree native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Theaceae and is characterized by its glossy, elliptical leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically greenish-yellow in color, which bloom in clusters during the rainy season. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny seeds, contributing to its dispersal in the wild. Roxburghia viridiflora is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in botanical gardens and tropical landscapes."
