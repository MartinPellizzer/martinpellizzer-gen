    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. mediocris, commonly known as the meadow buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5-10 petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, serrated leaves that are alternate along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, wetlands, and along stream banks. The subspecies mediocris is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and shorter stature compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
