    "intro": "Radermachera kerrii, commonly known as the Kerri's staghorn plant, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Fabaceae and is characterized by its distinctive, palmately lobed leaves that resemble the antlers of a stag. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that are clustered in racemes, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in warm, humid environments and prefers well-draining soil. Radermachera kerrii is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and relatively easy care requirements."
