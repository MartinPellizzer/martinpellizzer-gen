    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. subrigidus, commonly known as the rigid water buttercup, is a aquatic plant characterized by its submerged leaves and yellow flowers. It typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater environments such as ponds and lakes. The plant has a slender, branching stem with finely divided leaves that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water. Its flowers are small and consist of numerous petals arranged in a cup-like shape. This variety is adapted to aquatic conditions, with specialized structures that aid in buoyancy and photosynthesis."
