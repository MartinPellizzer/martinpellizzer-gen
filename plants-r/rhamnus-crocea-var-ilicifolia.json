    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea var. ilicifolia, commonly known as the coastal buckthorn, is a shrub native to coastal regions of western North America. It is characterized by its small, dark green leaves that are often covered in a fine, whitish pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by reddish-brown berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is adapted to salt spray and coastal conditions. Its compact growth habit and drought tolerance make it a hardy plant suitable for coastal landscaping."
