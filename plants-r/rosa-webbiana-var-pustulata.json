    "intro": "Rosa webbiana var. pustulata, commonly known as the Pustulate Banksia rose, is a shrub native to South Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and is typically found in rocky or coastal environments. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white or pale pink flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. Its leaves are narrow, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in arid conditions. The variety is noted for its hardiness and adaptability to well-drained soils."
