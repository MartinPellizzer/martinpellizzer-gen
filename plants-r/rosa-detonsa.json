    "intro": "Rosa detonsa, commonly known as the meadow rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring arching stems and compound leaves with five to seven leaflets. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its root system is fibrous, and it often forms dense colonies in moist, open habitats. Rosa detonsa is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
