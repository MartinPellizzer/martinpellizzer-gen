    "intro": "Rottboellia dimidiata, commonly known as the two-row grass or false brome, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, blade-like leaves that are often hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained conditions and full sun. Rottboellia dimidiata is often used in ornamental landscaping due to its attractive appearance and low maintenance requirements."
