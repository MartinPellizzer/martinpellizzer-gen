    "intro": "Rubus calycinus var. pectinelloides, commonly known as the red raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its arching canes and biennial growth habit, with the first year producing vegetative growth and the second year bearing fruit. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits called drupes, which are typically red when mature and contain multiple seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated margins and a hairy texture. The plant thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and commercial cultivation."
