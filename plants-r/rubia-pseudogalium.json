It is a low-growing perennial herb that typically reaches a height of about 10 to 30 centimeters. The plant features opposite, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale green. Its flowers are often followed by small, three-lobed berries that contain the seeds.
