    "intro": "Rhus parviflora, commonly known as the small-flowered sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils and thrives in full sun to partial shade. The plant features compound leaves with three to five leaflets, and its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters during the spring. Rhus parviflora produces red, fuzzy berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
