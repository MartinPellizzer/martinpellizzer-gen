It is characterized by its slender, arching stems covered in a dense, white tomentose (fuzzy) coating. The plant produces small, pinkish-white flowers in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and also covered in a soft, woolly layer of hairs. This variety is often found in moist, shady habitats such as stream banks and forest edges."
