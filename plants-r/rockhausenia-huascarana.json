    "intro": "Rockhausenia huascarana, commonly known as the Huascarana rockrose, is a flowering plant native to the Andean highlands of Peru. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, arid environments, adapted to the harsh conditions of its native habitat. The plant produces showy, pink to purple flowers that bloom in the spring, adding vibrant color to its alpine surroundings. Its leaves are small, leathery, and covered in a fine layer of wax, which helps reduce water loss. Rockhausenia huascarana is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural environment."
