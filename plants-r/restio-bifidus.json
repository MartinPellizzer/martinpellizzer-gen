    "intro": "Restio bifidus, commonly known as the bifid restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and compact, spike-like inflorescences. The plant typically grows in coastal and sandy environments, showing adaptability to harsh conditions. Its small white or pale blue flowers are clustered at the tips of the stems, and it produces small, wind-dispersed seeds. Restio bifidus is often found in fynbos vegetation, contributing to the biodiversity of its native habitat."
