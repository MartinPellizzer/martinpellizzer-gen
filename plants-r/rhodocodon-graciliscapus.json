    "intro": "Rhodocodon graciliscapus, commonly known as the slender-tipped rhodocodon, is a rare and delicate flowering plant native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are narrow and evergreen, while its flowers are pale pink to white, often appearing in late spring. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
