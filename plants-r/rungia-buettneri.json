    "intro": "Rungia buettneri, commonly known as the velvetleaf or black nightshade, is a tropical shrub native to regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that develop into fleshy, berry-like fruits containing several seeds. It is often found in moist, shaded areas such as rainforests and along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
