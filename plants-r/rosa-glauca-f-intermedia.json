    "intro": "Rosa glauca f. intermedia, commonly known as the intermediate blue rose, is a botanical variant of the blue rose, characterized by its unique coloration and horticultural traits. This form exhibits a blend of characteristics between the typical Rosa glauca and other Rosa species, resulting in a more vibrant blue hue than the standard blue rose. It is a compact shrub with thorny stems and dark green foliage, typical of many rose species. The flowers are usually single or semi-double, with a striking blue-pink coloration that fades as the bloom matures. This plant is valued in gardens for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its distinctive color and fragrance."
