    "intro": "Racinaea lutheri, commonly known as the Luther's air plant, is a species of epiphytic bromeliad native to the tropical regions of Central and South America. It is characterized by its rosette-shaped leaves that form a water-holding cup, which is typical of many bromeliads. The plant produces striking, colorful inflorescences that can range from red to orange, attracting pollinators such as bees and hummingbirds. Its leaves are typically long and narrow, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. Racinaea lutheri is relatively easy to care for, making it a popular choice for indoor gardening and terrariums."
