    "intro": "Rubus gracilis var. aitchisonii, commonly known as the Aitchison's bramble, is a variant of the slender blackberry species native to the mountainous regions of central Asia. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves. The plant produces aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color, with a tart flavor. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
