    "intro": "Rhamnus myrtina, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters, featuring dark green, oval leaves that turn red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are rich in anthocyanins. Its bark is smooth and dark brown, often peeling in thin layers, and it has a distinctive, somewhat aromatic scent. Rhamnus myrtina is often used in traditional medicine and is also valued in horticulture for its ornamental qualities."
