    "intro": "Rumex ursinus, commonly known as bear's rhubarb, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features broad, heart-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish-purple coloration. Its flowers are small and clustered in spikes, producing seeds that are dispersed by wind. Rumex ursinus has a fibrous root system and is known for its edible rhubarb-like stalks, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rhubarb species."
