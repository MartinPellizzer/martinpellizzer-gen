It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white or pinkish flowers. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow fruits called rose hips, which are often used in herbal remedies. Rosa caperata thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Its botanical features make it a hardy and adaptable species within its native range."
