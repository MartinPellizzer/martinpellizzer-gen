    "intro": "Rubus villicaulis microgene carmauxensis, commonly known as the Carmaux raspberry, is a rare shrub native to the Iberian Peninsula. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its small, red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in Mediterranean climates. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
