    "intro": "Rubus cuneatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with a distinctive cuneate (wedge-shaped) base. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed areas, and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Rubus cuneatus is an important food source for wildlife and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
