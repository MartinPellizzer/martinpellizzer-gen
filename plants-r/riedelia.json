    "intro": "Riedelia, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Malvaceae. It consists of several species, most notably Riedelia glabrata, which is native to tropical regions of Africa and South America. These plants are characterized by their large, palmate leaves and showy, yellow or orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The leaves are often covered in a fine, silvery down, giving the plant its common name. Riedelia is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage and floral display."
