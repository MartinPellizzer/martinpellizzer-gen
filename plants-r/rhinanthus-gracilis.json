    "intro": "Rhinanthus gracilis, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and semi-parasitic plants. This species is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often in association with other wildflowers. Rhinanthus gracilis plays a role in supporting pollinators and is an indicator of low-nutrient soils."
