    "intro": "Rubus horridus var. wirtgenii, commonly known as the Wirtgen's bramble, is a variant of the brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it is often found in temperate regions with moderate rainfall."
