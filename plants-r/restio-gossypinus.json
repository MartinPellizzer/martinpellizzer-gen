    "intro": "Restio gossypinus, commonly known as the woolly restio, is a perennial grass-like plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and dense, woolly foliage that gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal and mountainous regions. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural habitats."
