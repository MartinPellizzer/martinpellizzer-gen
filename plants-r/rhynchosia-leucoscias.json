It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and nitrogen-fixing ability. The plant features trifoliate leaves and produces showy, white or pale yellow flowers that attract pollinators. Its seed pods are covered in hooked spines, aiding in seed dispersal by attaching to animal fur or clothing. Rhynchosia leucoscias is often used in traditional medicine and as a forage plant for livestock."
