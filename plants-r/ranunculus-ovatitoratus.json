    "intro": "Ranunculus ovatitoratus, commonly known as the broad-leaf buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often accompanied by a ring of sepals that resemble additional petals. The plant has compound, ovate leaves that are typically hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and forest edges. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
