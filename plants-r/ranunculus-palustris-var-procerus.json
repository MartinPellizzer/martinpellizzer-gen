    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris var. procerus, commonly known as the slender water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in North America. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, lance-shaped leaf structure. The plant typically grows in marshy or boggy areas, preferring moist, acidic soils. Its flowers bloom in early spring, often before the leaves fully emerge. This variant is distinguished by its longer, more slender stems compared to the typical form of Ranunculus palustris."
