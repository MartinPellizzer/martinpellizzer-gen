    "intro": "Rindera, commonly known as the red sandalwood, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Fabaceae. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, often with a distinctive reddish or brownish hue. The flowers are typically small and clustered, with a pea-like structure typical of the legume family. Rindera species are native to various parts of Africa and are valued for their hard, durable wood. However, many species are threatened due to overharvesting and habitat loss."
