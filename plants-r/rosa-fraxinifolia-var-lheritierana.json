    "intro": "Rosa fraxinifolia var. lheritierana, commonly known as the Lheritier's rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It features pale yellow to orange flowers with a distinctive, fragrant scent, blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy underside, and its stems are often covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a container plant. Due to its rarity, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by specialty growers."
