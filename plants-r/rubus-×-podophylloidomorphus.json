    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 podophylloidomorphus, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry or raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant is deciduous, shedding its leaves in autumn, and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it produces edible berries that are valued for their flavor and culinary uses. This hybrid is often cultivated for its hardiness and productivity in both home gardens and commercial agriculture."
