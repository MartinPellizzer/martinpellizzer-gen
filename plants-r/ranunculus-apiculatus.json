    "intro": "Ranunculus apiculatus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and western Asia. It typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, thriving in cool, moist environments. The plant features a short, hairy stem that supports its delicate, cup-shaped flowers, which are usually bright yellow with dark centers. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a rough, hairy texture that helps reduce water loss in high-altitude conditions. Ranunculus apiculatus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
