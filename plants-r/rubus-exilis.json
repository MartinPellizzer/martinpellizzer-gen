    "intro": "Rubus exilis, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the western United States. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and small, dark red berries that mature in late summer. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pale pink flowers in early spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and edible berries, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
