    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. subemarginatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry species. It is characterized by its narrow, serrated leaves that are typically darker green than the standard variety. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible but often less flavorful than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. This variant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its hardy nature and fruit production."
