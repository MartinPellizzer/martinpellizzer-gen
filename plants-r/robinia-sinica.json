    "intro": "Robinia sinica, commonly known as the Chinese honeylocust, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to China. It features compound leaves that are typically pinnately arranged with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by long, bean-like pods containing edible seeds. It is valued for its rapid growth and tolerance to various soil conditions, making it suitable for reforestation and ornamental purposes. However, it can become invasive in some regions if not properly managed."
