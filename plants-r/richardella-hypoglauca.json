    "intro": "Richardella hypoglauca, commonly known as the blue-green fern, is a member of the Dicksoniaceae family and is native to New Zealand. It is a small, evergreen fern characterized by its delicate, arching fronds that are typically a bluish-green in color. The plant grows in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest understories. Its spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds. Richardella hypoglauca is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with the right conditions."
