    "intro": "Rubus bakonyensis f. aurorae, commonly known as the dawn raspberry. This plant is a rare flowering shrub native to the Carpathian Basin, characterized by its delicate pink flowers that bloom in early spring. It has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces small, edible berries similar to other raspberries. The plant thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
