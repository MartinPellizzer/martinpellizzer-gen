    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum var. fallax, commonly known as the Alpine Rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green with a slight pubescence, and it produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens or as a border plant. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare in cultivation."
