    "intro": "Rhinanthus serotinus subsp. arenarius, commonly known as the sand rhinoceros flower, is a hemiparasitic plant that relies on a network of host plants for some of its nutritional needs. It is native to sandy and calcareous soils in southern Europe and parts of North Africa. The plant produces yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It has slender, branched stems and small, lance-shaped leaves. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and threatened species in many areas."
