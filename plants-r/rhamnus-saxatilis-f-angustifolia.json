    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis f. angustifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its slender, angular stems and small, dark green leaves that are typically narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This subspecies is noted for its hardy nature and ability to colonize harsh environments."
