    "intro": "Rhynchospora asperula, commonly known as rough spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy environments in the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring slender, upright stems covered in rough, hairy texture. The plant produces dense clusters of small, pale green to reddish-brown flowers, which are arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Its leaves are narrow, linear, and often have a waxy coating, aiding in water retention. Rhynchospora asperula plays an important ecological role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
