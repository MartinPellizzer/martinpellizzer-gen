    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. systyla, commonly known as the creeping rose or field rose, is a perennial shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with multiple stems that often spread along the ground. The plant produces simple, alternate leaves that are typically oval to elliptic in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its flowers are usually pink to red, appearing in clusters at the leaf axils, and are followed by oval, red-orange fruits called hips. This variety is well adapted to disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas."
