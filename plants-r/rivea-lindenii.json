    "intro": "Rivea lindenii, commonly known as the Lindley's morning glory, is a climbing vine native to South America. It produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep purple, often with a striking contrast between the petals and the green calyx. The plant is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to thrive in warm, humid climates. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and often have a velvety texture. The flowers typically open in the morning and close by midday, earning it its common name."
