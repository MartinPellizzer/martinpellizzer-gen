    "intro": "Rosa vosagiaca var. montanifolia, commonly known as the mountain rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright stems with thorny branches and produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, serrated leaves that are arranged alternately along the stems. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its persistent red hips that appear in the fall."
