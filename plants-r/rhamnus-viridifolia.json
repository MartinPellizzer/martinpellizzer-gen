    "intro": "Rhamnus viridifolia, commonly known as the greenleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, oval-shaped leaves that are typically a vibrant green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and dry slopes. The species is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native plant gardens."
