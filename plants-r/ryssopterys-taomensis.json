    "intro": "Ryssopterys taomensis, commonly known as the Taomen fern, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped fronds with a distinct midrib. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often found in mountainous regions with rich, well-drained soil. Its spore-producing structures are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of its fern classification. Due to habitat loss, Ryssopterys taomensis is considered vulnerable, highlighting the need for conservation efforts."
