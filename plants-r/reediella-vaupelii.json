It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense inflorescences. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species. Its botanical study is important for understanding biodiversity in its native ecosystems."
