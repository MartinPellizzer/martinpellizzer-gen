    "intro": "Rubus pruinosus f. subgothicus, commonly known as the subalpine raspberry, is a variant of the brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its densely hairy, dark green leaves and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically tart and have a slightly acidic flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in high-altitude ecosystems."
