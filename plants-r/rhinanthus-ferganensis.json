    "intro": "Rhinanthus ferganensis, commonly known as the Fergana yellowtop, is a flowering plant native to Central Asia. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in dry, grassy habitats and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
