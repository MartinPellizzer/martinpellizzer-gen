    "intro": "Rubus rosaceus var. patuliflorus, commonly known as the large-flowered blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its large, showy white to pink flowers that appear in late spring. The plant produces dark purple to black berries that are typically larger and more flavorful than those of the standard blackberry. It thrives in temperate climates and requires well-drained soil and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for both its ornamental value and edible fruit."
