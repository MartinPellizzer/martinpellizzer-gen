    "intro": "Rapuntium assurgens, commonly known as the climbing cress, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a sprawling growth habit with trailing stems that can climb or creep along the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. Rapuntium assurgens is often found in moist, disturbed soils along stream banks and in woodland edges."
