    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. orbiculatus, commonly known as the round-leaf blackberry, is a variant of the common bramble. It is characterized by its rounded, leathery leaves that are typically darker green and more compact compared to the standard species. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are often used in jams and desserts. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its botanical features make it both a useful ornamental plant and a valuable source of edible fruits."
