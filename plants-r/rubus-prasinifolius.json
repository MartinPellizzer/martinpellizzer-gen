    "intro": "Rubus prasinifolius, commonly known as the green-leaved bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, where it thrives in moist, shaded environments. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are typically a vibrant green, and its small, aggregate fruits that develop from its flowers. It produces white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, which are followed by the formation of edible berries. The plant is often found in forest understories and is valued for its ornamental qualities and potential medicinal uses."
