It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils along stream banks and in shaded woodlands. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy and often toxic flowers. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in many states."
