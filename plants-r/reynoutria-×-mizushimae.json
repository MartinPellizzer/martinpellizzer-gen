    "intro": "Reynoutria \u00d7 mizushimae, commonly known as the hybrid giant knotweed, is a sterile hybrid species resulting from the cross between *Reynoutria japonica* (Japanese knotweed) and *Reynoutria sieboldii* (Siberian knotweed). It is characterized by its robust growth, large heart-shaped leaves, and clusters of small, pale pink flowers that appear in late summer. The plant is notable for its rapid growth rate and ability to thrive in a variety of soil conditions, making it highly invasive in many regions. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread aggressively, often outcompeting native vegetation. Due to its ecological impact, it is considered a noxious weed in several countries."
