    "intro": "Rumex, commonly known as sorrel, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Polygonaceae. These plants are characterized by their distinctive arrow-shaped leaves and are often found in moist, shady environments. Many species of Rumex are edible, with leaves that have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. They are also known for their ability to thrive in a variety of soil types and climates. Some species are used in traditional medicine and horticulture."
