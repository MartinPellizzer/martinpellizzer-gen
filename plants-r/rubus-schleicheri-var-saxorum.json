    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. saxorum, commonly known as the saxicola raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically arranged alternately along the branches. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Rubus genus."
