    "intro": "Rhododendron tetramerum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is a shrub that typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant produces showy, clustered flowers that are usually pink or purple, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are elliptical and\u9769\u8d28 (leathery), providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its harsh environment. Rhododendron tetramerum is valued for its ornamental beauty and plays an important ecological role in its native habitats."
