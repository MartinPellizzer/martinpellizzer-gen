    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. koehleriformis, commonly known as the Koehler's bramble, is a rare and endemic species native to specific regions of southern Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. It thrives in moist, shaded environments, often found in forest undergrowth or along stream banks. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
