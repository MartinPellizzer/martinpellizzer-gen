    "intro": "Ruscus humilis, commonly known as common spurge or sea spurge, is a low-growing evergreen shrub native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It features dense, fleshy, spiny leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stems. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, fleshy berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in maritime climates. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in horticulture for erosion control and ornamental purposes."
