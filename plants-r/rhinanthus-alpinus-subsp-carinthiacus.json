    "intro": "Rhinanthus alpinus subsp. carinthiacus, commonly known as the Carinthian redtop, is a flowering plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its vivid orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky slopes. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
