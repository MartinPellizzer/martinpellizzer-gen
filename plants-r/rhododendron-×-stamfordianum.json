    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 stamfordianum, commonly known as the Stamford hybrid rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant produces small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in whorls around the stem. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. The Stamford hybrid is valued for its ornamental beauty and hardiness in cooler climates."
