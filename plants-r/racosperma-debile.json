    "intro": "Racosperma debile, commonly known as the slender acacia, is a small shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the legume family, Fabaceae, and is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers. The plant is adapted to arid environments, with small, waxy leaves to reduce water loss. It produces small, pod-like fruits that contain several seeds. Racosperma debile is often found in sandy soils and is used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardiness."
