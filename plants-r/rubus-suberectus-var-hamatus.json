    "intro": "Rubus suberectus var. hamatus, commonly known as the rough bramble, is a shrub native to parts of Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its prickly nature, it can be challenging to handle without protective gear."
