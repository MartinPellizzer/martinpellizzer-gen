    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa f. aciculosa, commonly known as the prickly rose or bristly rose, is a compact, shrub-like form of the shrub rose. It features small, narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its \"aciculosa\" designation, meaning \"needle-like\" in Latin. The plant produces fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in early summer. It is native to southern Europe and thrives in well-drained soils and full sun. This variety is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature."
