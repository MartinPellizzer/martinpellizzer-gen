    "intro": "Ravensara aromatica, commonly known as the sweet myrtle, is a small evergreen tree or shrub native to the eastern coast of Australia. It is characterized by its aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that emit a pleasant fragrance when crushed. The plant produces small, white, fragrant flowers that bloom in spring, followed by dark blue, edible berries. Ravensara aromatica thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in coastal heathlands and dry sclerophyll forests. It is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional Indigenous medicine."
