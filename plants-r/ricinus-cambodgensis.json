    "intro": "Ricinus cambodgensis, commonly known as the Cambodian castor plant, is a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and spiny stems. The plant produces distinctive capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. It thrives in tropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and research settings."
