    "intro": "Rhysolepis arenaria, commonly known as the sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to the western United States and parts of Mexico. It is a low-growing annual or perennial herb that thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of pink, purple, and white, typically blooming in the spring and summer. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered with fine hairs, and it is well adapted to arid environments. Rhysolepis arenaria is often found in coastal dunes and dry grasslands, where it plays a role in stabilizing sand dunes and supporting local biodiversity."
