    "intro": "Rosa viscaria var. macrophylla, commonly known as the large-leafed rose, is a variant of the shrub rose species characterized by its broad, leathery leaves and showy, fragrant flowers. It is native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, where it thrives in cooler, temperate climates. The plant produces clusters of pink or red semi-double to fully double flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage is dense and evergreen, providing ornamental value throughout the year. Rosa viscaria var. macrophylla is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to attract pollinators."
