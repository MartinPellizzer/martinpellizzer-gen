    "intro": "Rhamnus flavida, commonly known as the yellow buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of North America. It typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed sites, reaching heights of up to 6 feet. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are elliptic to ovate in shape, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers appear in clusters during the spring, followed by dark blue, fleshy berries that are an important food source for birds. The bark is grayish-brown and becomes fissured with age, contributing to its rugged appearance."
