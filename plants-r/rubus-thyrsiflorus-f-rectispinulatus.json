    "intro": "Rubus thyrsiflorus f. rectispinulatus, commonly known as the upright spiny raspberry, is a variant of the thrysoflorus raspberry species. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and distinctive spines that are more pronounced and rigid compared to the typical form. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often found in woodland edges and open areas, where it can receive adequate sunlight. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its unique appearance."
