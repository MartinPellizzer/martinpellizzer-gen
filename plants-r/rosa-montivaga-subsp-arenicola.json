    "intro": "Rosa montivaga subsp. arenicola, commonly known as the sand rose, is a subspecies of the rock rose native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its low-growing, spreading habit and is often found in sandy or gravelly soils. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of small, hairy leaves that help it retain moisture in arid conditions. It is a hardy, drought-tolerant shrub that thrives in full sun and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover."
