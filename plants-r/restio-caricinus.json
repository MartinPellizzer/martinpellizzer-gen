    "intro": "Restio caricinus, commonly known as the river restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Restionaceae family and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with narrow, grassy leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in dense, spike-like inflorescences. It thrives in moist, sandy soils near rivers and streams, often forming dense vegetation along waterways. Due to its habitat preferences, it plays an important ecological role in stabilizing riverbanks and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
