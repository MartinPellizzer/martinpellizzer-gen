    "intro": "Rubus dendrocharis, commonly known as the tree raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its woody stems and compound leaves, which are typically three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are red when ripe, similar in appearance to raspberries. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
