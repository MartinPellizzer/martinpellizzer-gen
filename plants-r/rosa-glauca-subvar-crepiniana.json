    "intro": "Rosa glauca subvar. crepiniana, commonly known as the Crepiniana rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central and Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender flowers, which bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows as a shrub with thorny stems and narrow, dark green leaves. Its botanical features include tightly packed, glandular hairs on the foliage and stems, which help in reducing water loss. This subvariety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its delicate floral display."
