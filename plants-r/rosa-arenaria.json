    "intro": "Rosa arenaria, commonly known as the sand rose, is a hardy shrub native to the Mediterranean region and parts of Europe. It is characterized by its slender, spreading stems and small, fragrant flowers that range from white to pink. The plant thrives in well-drained, sandy or gravelly soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for coastal or arid environments. Its leaves are narrow and covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, red hips that contain seeds. Rosa arenaria is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize sandy soils."
