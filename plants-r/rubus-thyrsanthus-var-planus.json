    "intro": "Rubus thyrsanthus var. planus, commonly known as the flat-stemmed blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to South America. It is characterized by its flat, ribless stems and dark purple to black berries that are typically smaller than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. It is often cultivated for its edible fruits, which have a tart flavor and are used in jams and desserts. The plant is also valued for its ornamental appeal due to its attractive foliage and flowering bracts."
