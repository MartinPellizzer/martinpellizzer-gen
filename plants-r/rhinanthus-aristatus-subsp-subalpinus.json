    "intro": "Rhinanthus aristatus subsp. subalpinus, commonly known as the alpine yellow rattle, is a herbaceous plant native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to August. The plant grows in rocky or gravelly soils at high altitudes, often in mountainous areas. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Its presence is an indicator of well-drained, nutrient-poor habitats in alpine environments."
