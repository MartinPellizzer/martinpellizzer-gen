    "intro": "Racosperma gonocladum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It is characterized by its slender, often spindly growth habit and its distinctive, narrow, linear leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in compact spikes, which are typically arranged in clusters along the stems. It is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Racosperma gonocladum is often found in open woodlands and on rocky outcrops, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various wildlife species."
