    "intro": "Rubus longeacuminatus, commonly known as the long-acuminate raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its erect or decumbent growth habit and produces trifoliate leaves with serrated margins. The plant bears small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature, resembling those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
