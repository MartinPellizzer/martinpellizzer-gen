    "intro": "Rubus affinis subsp. variidens, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with three to five leaflets. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The subspecies is notable for its variability in leaf shape and fruit size, contributing to its common name."
