    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 schwarzeri, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (brambles) and Rubus pectoralis (raspberries). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its vigorous growth, it is sometimes considered an invasive species in certain regions."
