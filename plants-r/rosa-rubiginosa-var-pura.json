    "intro": "Rosa rubiginosa var. pura, commonly known as the sweetbriar rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that ripen in late summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and serrated. Rosa rubiginosa var. pura is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in hedgerows and as a source of rose hips."
