    "intro": "Rubus radula subsp. oreus, commonly known as the oreous raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of small, usually pink or white flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the subspecies. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at higher elevations. The leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are covered in fine, silvery hairs."
