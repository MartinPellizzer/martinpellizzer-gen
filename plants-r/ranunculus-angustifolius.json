    "intro": "Ranunculus angustifolius, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, showy flowers with five to ten petals, typically in shades of yellow or white, and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant has a basal rosette of finely divided, lance-shaped leaves, and its stems are hairy and upright. It produces small, green, fleshy fruits called achenes, which are dispersed by wind. Ranunculus angustifolius is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is also a food source for various pollinators."
