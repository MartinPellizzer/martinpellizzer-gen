    "intro": "Reichardia intermedia subsp. gracilis, commonly known as slender reichardia, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the eastern United States. It typically features basal rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are often covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss. Reichardia intermedia subsp. gracilis is characterized by its delicate appearance and is often found in association with other shade-tolerant species."
