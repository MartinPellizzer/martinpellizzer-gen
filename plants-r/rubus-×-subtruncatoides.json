    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 subtruncatoides, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its vigorous growth and thorny stems. It is native to the eastern United States and is known for its distinctive purple foliage, which becomes more pronounced in cooler weather. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black, resembling raspberries in appearance. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value and invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a problematic weed in natural areas."
