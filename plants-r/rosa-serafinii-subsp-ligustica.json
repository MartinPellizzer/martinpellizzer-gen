    "intro": "Rosa serafinii subsp. ligustica, commonly known as the Ligustic Rose, is a rare and striking species native to the alpine regions of the Balkans. It is characterized by its large, showy pink to purple flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant has slender, hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in rocky or forested areas. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable subject for botanical study and conservation efforts."
