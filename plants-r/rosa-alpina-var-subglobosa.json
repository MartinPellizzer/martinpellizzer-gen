It features small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has woody stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which help protect it from cold and moisture loss. Its leaves are dark green, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. This variety is well adapted to alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun."
