    "intro": "Rumex cuneifolius, commonly known as narrow-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped, with a smooth or slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, greenish flowers in the spring, which are followed by reddish-brown, triangular seeds. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found along roadsides and in wet meadows. The leaves are edible and have been used historically in traditional medicine and as a vegetable."
