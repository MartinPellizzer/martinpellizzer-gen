    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 altaclerense, commonly known as the Alpine azalea, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rhododendron catawbiense and Rhododendron lapponicum. It is characterized by its dense, dark green foliage and clusters of showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. This species is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly the Alps, where it thrives in cool, moist, and well-drained soils. It is typically found in rocky or forested areas at elevations above 1,500 meters. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
