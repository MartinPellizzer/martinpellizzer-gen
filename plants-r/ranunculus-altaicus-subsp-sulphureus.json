It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers, which typically have five to seven petals and are surrounded by a ring of sepals. The plant produces a distinctive, pungent odor, which is a common trait among members of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are trifoliate and have a hairy texture, while the stems are usually unbranched and covered in fine pubescence. This subspecies thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats."
