It features striking, star-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange, often with a distinctive red or purple throat. The plant produces a cluster of narrow, grass-like leaves and has a corm-like underground stem. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its long blooming period, typically in spring."
