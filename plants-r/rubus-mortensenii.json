    "intro": "Rubus mortensenii, commonly known as the Mortensen's blackberry, is a species of shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with three leaflets that are serrated along the edges. The fruit is edible but often has a tart flavor, making it a subject of interest for both botanists and local foragers."
