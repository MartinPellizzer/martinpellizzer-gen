    "intro": "Rapunculus comosus, commonly known as the goat's beard, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive, fluffy, yellowish-white composite flowers that resemble a goat's beard, hence its common name. The plant has a short, upright stem with basal leaves that are heart-shaped and hairy. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, attracting various pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Rapunculus comosus is often grown in gardens for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to cultivate in well-drained soil."
