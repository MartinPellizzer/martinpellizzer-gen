    "intro": "Robinia glomerata, commonly known as the yellow blossom acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces clusters of yellow, fragrant flowers in the spring, which are followed by long, flat pods. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas. Robinia glomerata is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to fix nitrogen, improving soil fertility."
