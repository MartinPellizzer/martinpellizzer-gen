    "intro": "Rubus linearifoliolus var. yanshanensis, commonly known as the Yanshan blackberry, is a shrub native to China, specifically the Yanshan region. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and dark green, elliptical leaves with finely serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color, typical of many Rubus species. It thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil and partial shade. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry species."
