    "intro": "Rosa canina f. touranginiana, commonly known as the Touranginiana rose, is a rare and distinctive cultivar of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers, which are often more delicate and showier than those of the typical Rosa canina. The plant has a compact growth habit with thorny stems and dark green foliage. It is prized for its ornamental value in gardens and its historical significance in horticultural collections. This form is believed to have originated from a natural mutation or grafting, making it a unique addition to the Rosa genus."
