    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris var. macrophyllus, commonly known as the large-leaf water buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland areas of North America. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has heart-shaped, broad leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water surface. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread along the edges of ponds and marshes. It plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and amphibians."
