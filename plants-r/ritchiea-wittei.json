    "intro": "Ritchiea wittei, commonly known as the silver-leafed cycad, is a unique member of the Cycadaceae family native to Madagascar. It is characterized by its distinctive, narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a waxy, silver-gray sheath. The plant produces large, cone-like structures, with the female cones being particularly showy and often used in traditional ceremonies. Ritchiea wittei thrives in tropical climates with well-drained soil and requires minimal water once established. Due to its slow growth and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
