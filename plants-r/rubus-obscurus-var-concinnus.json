    "intro": "Rubus obscurus var. concinnus, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry genus native to the eastern United States. It is a shrub characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its climbing or\u530d\u5310 growth pattern. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically less showy than other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually serrated and have a slightly hairy texture. The flowers are white and clustered in small groups, typical of the Rubus genus, and are followed by the edible, though somewhat tart, fruits."
