    "intro": "Racosperma galeatum, commonly known as the coastal wattle, is a shrub native to the coastal regions of southern Australia. It is characterized by its yellow, pea-like flowers that bloom in late winter to early spring. The plant has slender, wiry stems and compound leaves with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils and is often found in coastal dunes and heathlands. Racosperma galeatum is well adapted to saline and windy conditions, making it a resilient species in its native habitat."
