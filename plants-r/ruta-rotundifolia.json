    "intro": "Ruta rotundifolia, commonly known as common rue, is a perennial herb native to southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its aromatic, pinnately compound leaves with rounded lobes and small, yellowish-green flowers. The plant contains several volatile oils, including rutin and thymol, which contribute to its medicinal properties. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or dry environments. Its historical use in herbal medicine dates back to ancient times, particularly for its digestive and antispasmodic effects."
