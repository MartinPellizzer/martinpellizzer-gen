    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus var. amphicarpus, commonly known as the red-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow or orange flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. It is characterized by its ability to produce both vegetative and sexual reproduction, with some populations producing two types of flowers. This variation contributes to its ecological adaptability and ornamental value in gardens."
