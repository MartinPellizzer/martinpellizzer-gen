    "intro": "Rhamnus javanica, commonly known as the Java buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It typically grows to a height of 3\u20136 meters and has smooth, grayish bark that becomes fissured with age. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue, globose berries that are rich in anthocyanins. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its native habitat. Rhamnus javanica is often found in moist, shaded areas such as forests and along stream banks."
