    "intro": "Rhytis, commonly known as the golden rain tree, is a deciduous tree native to China. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are opposite and pinnate, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. The plant produces clusters of small, yellow flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by elongated, bean-like pods. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a popular ornamental tree. Rhytis is also valued for its rapid growth and ability to provide shade in urban landscapes."
