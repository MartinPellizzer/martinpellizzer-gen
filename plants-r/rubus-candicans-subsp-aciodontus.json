It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its fruits are aggregate berries, typically pale yellow or white, which are edible but have a mild, somewhat tart flavor. This subspecies is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as forests and along stream banks."
