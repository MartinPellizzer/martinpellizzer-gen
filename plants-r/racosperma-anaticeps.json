    "intro": "Racosperma anaticeps, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wattle, is a flowering plant native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its distinctive pod fruits and often nitrogen-fixing abilities. The plant typically grows as a shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with slender, wiry stems and small, bipinnate leaves. Its bright yellow flowers, which appear in late winter to early spring, are clustered in racemes and attract a variety of pollinators. The species is well adapted to dry, sandy soils and is often found in coastal and inland regions of southern Australia."
