    "intro": "Rhododendron gaultheriifolium var. gaultheriifolium, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It features broad, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and slightly hairy, adapted to cold and high-altitude environments. The plant produces clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, which are rich in nectar and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in well-drained, acidic soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens in cooler climates."
