    "intro": "Rumex altissimus, commonly known as tall sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its tall, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish or purple on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are pollinated by wind. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Rumex altissimus is known for its edible leaves, which have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content."
