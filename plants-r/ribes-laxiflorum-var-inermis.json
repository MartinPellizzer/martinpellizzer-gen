    "intro": "Ribes laxiflorum var. inermis, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gooseberry, is a shrub native to the western United States. It belongs to the Grossulariaceae family and is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, alternate leaves. The plant produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its leaves are typically ovate to elliptic in shape, with a smooth margin, and the plant is often found in moist, woodland habitats. The variety inermis is distinguished by the absence of thorns on its stems, making it less prickly than other Ribes species."
