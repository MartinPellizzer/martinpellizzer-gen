    "intro": "Rosa canina var. aciphylla, commonly known as the thornless dog rose, is a variant of the dog rose species native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its lack of thorns on the stems, which distinguishes it from the typical Rosa canina. The plant produces fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by orange-red hips in the autumn. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with five to seven leaflets, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is also used in traditional herbal remedies."
