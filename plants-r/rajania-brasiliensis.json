    "intro": "Rajania brasiliensis, commonly known as the Brazilian orchid, is a species native to the rainforests of South America. It is a member of the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its striking, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its roots are adapted to absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rain. Rajania brasiliensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and plays a role in the ecological diversity of its habitat."
