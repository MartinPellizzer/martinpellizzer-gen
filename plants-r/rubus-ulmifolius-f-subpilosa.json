It is characterized by its finely hairy leaves and stems, giving it a distinctive silvery appearance. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less flavorful than those of the standard Rubus ulmifolius. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along hedgerows. This form is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
