    "intro": "Rosa saturella, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers in the spring. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white woolly hair. Rosa saturella is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to flourish in harsh, high-altitude conditions."
