    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. floccosus, commonly known as the fuzzy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and large, aggregate fruits that turn from green to dark purple as they mature. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a velvety texture. This plant thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Its fruit is edible, though the hairy texture may make it less palatable compared to other blackberry varieties."
