    "intro": "Roupala excelsa, commonly known as the silver tree, is a tall evergreen tree native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its smooth, silvery-gray bark and broad, feather-like leaves that are arranged in a distinctive spiral pattern. The tree produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring, followed by woody, cone-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in coastal and lowland areas. Due to its unique appearance and ecological importance, it is a notable species in New Zealand's native flora."
