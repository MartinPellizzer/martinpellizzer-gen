    "intro": "Rouliniella columbiana, commonly known as the Columbia lily, is a rare flowering plant native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is a member of the Liliaceae family and is characterized by its showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. It has strap-like, grassy leaves and produces small, cylindrical seed pods that disperse its seeds by wind. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered and is protected in several regions."
