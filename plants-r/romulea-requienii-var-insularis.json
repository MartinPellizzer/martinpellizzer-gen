    "intro": "Romulea requienii var. insularis, commonly known as the island glory-of-the-snow, is a perennial bulbous plant native to the Canary Islands. It produces striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a yellowish or greenish tinge. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and is adapted to grow in well-drained, rocky soils. It blooms in spring and is often found in coastal areas or on slopes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
