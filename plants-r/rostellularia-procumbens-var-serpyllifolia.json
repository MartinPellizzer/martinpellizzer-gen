    "intro": "Rostellularia procumbens var. serpyllifolia, commonly known as creeping rosette grass, is a low-growing perennial herb native to the eastern United States. It features a mat-forming growth habit with rhizomes that allow it to spread across the ground. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, and its inflorescence consists of small, spike-like clusters of flowers. It produces tiny, wind-pollinated flowers that develop into small, dry fruits. This species is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and streambanks."
