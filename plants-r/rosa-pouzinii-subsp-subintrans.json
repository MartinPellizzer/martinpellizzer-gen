    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii subsp. subintrans, commonly known as the subintrans rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring. The leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that provide a textured appearance. This subspecies is adapted to rocky and well-drained soils, often growing in alpine or subalpine environments. Its ornamental value is notable, though it is less commonly cultivated than other rose species."
