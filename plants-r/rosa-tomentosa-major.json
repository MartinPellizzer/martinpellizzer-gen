    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa major, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a shrub native to parts of Asia, particularly China and the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, soft appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven elliptical leaflets, and the plant is often cultivated for its ornamental value. Rosa tomentosa major is relatively drought-tolerant and thrives in well-drained soils, making it suitable for gardens in temperate climates."
