    "intro": "Rhus tysonii, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, clustered yellow flowers that develop into red, fuzzy fruits. Its roots are fibrous and can spread widely, making it a persistent weed in disturbed soils. Staghorn sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and open fields."
