    "intro": "Raxamaris, commonly known as the moonlight orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the misty highlands of the Andes. It features striking silver-white petals with a subtle iridescent sheen that reflects light like moonlight. The plant has a compact, bushy growth habit with narrow, lance-shaped leaves covered in a fine, waxy coating. It blooms once a year during the late summer, producing delicate, fragrant flowers that attract specific species of nocturnal pollinators. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, Raxamaris is considered a conservation concern."
