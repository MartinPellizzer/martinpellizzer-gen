    "intro": "Rosa omissa var. collivaga, commonly known as the Alpine rock rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a shrub that typically grows in rocky, alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink or white flowers during the summer months. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white down, which helps to reduce water loss in harsh conditions. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable growing conditions."
