It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in upright clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and grayish, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade in well-drained soils. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to tolerate various environmental conditions."
