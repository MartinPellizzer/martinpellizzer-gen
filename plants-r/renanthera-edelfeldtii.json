It is characterized by its pendulous, showy flowers that typically bloom in shades of pink and white. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients. Its roots are fibrous and adapted to absorb moisture from the humid environment. It thrives in warm, shaded conditions with high humidity, making it a popular choice for greenhouse cultivation."
