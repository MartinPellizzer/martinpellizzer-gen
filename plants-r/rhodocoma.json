    "intro": "Rhodocoma, commonly known as the red-hot poker, is a genus of flowering plants in the sunflower family, Asteraceae. It is native to southern Africa and includes several species that are characterized by their striking, spiky flower heads. The plants typically grow in rocky or sandy soils and are drought-tolerant, making them suitable for Mediterranean climates. Rhodocoma species produce vibrant orange to red flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. They are often used in rock gardens and as ornamental plants due to their bold appearance."
