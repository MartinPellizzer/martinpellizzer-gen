    "intro": "Rosa montana subsp. salaevensis, commonly known as the Armenian rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It features upright stems covered in dense, thorny branches, and its leaves are pinnately compound with oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces showy, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in well-drained, sunny conditions. It is also valued for its historical use in traditional medicine."
