    "intro": "Rubus exsuccus, commonly known as the dry raspberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries but are typically less showy. The plant produces yellowish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. Rubus exsuccus is often found in dry, rocky habitats and is adapted to poor soil conditions."
