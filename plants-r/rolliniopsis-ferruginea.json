    "intro": "Rolliniopsis ferruginea, commonly known as the rusty leaf fern, is a species of epiphytic fern native to Southeast Asia. It features delicate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in a rusty-colored bloom, giving it its common name. The plant thrives in humid, shaded environments, often growing on trees or rocks in tropical forests. Its fronds are usually clustered closely together, forming a compact, low-growing structure. Rolliniopsis ferruginea is valued for its ornamental appearance and is sometimes cultivated as a houseplant."
