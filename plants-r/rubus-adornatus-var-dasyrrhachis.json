    "intro": "Rubus adornatus var. dasyrrhachis, commonly known as the woolly blackberry, is a shrub native to South America, particularly in Argentina and Chile. It is characterized by its dense, woolly pubescence covering the stems and leaves, which gives it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate to elliptic in shape, and often have a serrated margin. This species is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
