    "intro": "Rubroshorea scabrida, commonly known as the rough bark tree, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its rough, fissured bark that gives it its common name. The plant has simple, opposite leaves that are usually elliptical in shape and have a slightly serrated margin. It produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color, followed by woody capsules containing its seeds. Rubroshorea scabrida is often found in moist, shaded forest understories and is valued for its ornamental bark and potential medicinal properties."
