It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant features delicate, floating leaves with a waxy surface and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. It is characterized by its rhizomatous growth and ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and sensitive indicator of water quality."
