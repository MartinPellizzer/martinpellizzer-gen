    "intro": "Rhus perakensis, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that becomes rough and furrowed with age. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by bright red, velvety fruits in the fall. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and turn vibrant orange or red in autumn. The plant is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and can thrive in a variety of soil types."
