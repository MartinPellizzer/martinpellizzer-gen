    "intro": "Rosa rugosa f. rubroplena, commonly known as the red-flowered rugosa rose, is a hybrid rose species native to coastal regions of China. It is characterized by its robust growth, thorny stems, and large, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to deep red. The plant produces showy, semi-double blooms that are often covered in a distinctive red bloom, giving it its cultivar name. It is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in sandy soils. The foliage is dark green and somewhat hairy, providing a striking contrast to its vibrant flowers."
