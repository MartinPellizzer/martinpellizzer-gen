    "intro": "Rhus cotinus, commonly known as smoke bush, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its ornamental, feathery, pinkish to reddish inflorescences that resemble smoke, which appear in late summer. The plant has compound leaves that are pinnately arranged, with small, oval-shaped leaflets. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is drought-tolerant once established. Rhus cotinus is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its adaptability to various soil types."
