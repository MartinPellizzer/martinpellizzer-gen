It is characterized by its climbing habit and trifoliate leaves, which are typically palmately arranged. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by distinctive, spiny pods. Rhynchosia zernyi is a member of the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules. It is often found in disturbed habitats and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
