    "intro": "Ribes menziesii var. hystrix, commonly known as the hairy gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its erect, spiny stems covered in dense, glandular hairs, which give it its common name. The leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, often with a bluish-green hue beneath. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by edible, tart berries that are typically orange to red in color. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits, providing food for wildlife and supporting pollinators."
