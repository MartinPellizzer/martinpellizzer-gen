It is characterized by its fragrant, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has slender, thorny stems and pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are typically borne singly or in small clusters at the ends of the branches. Rosa pallidiflora is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and is often used in gardens for its delicate beauty and fragrance."
