    "intro": "Rhizaeris alba, commonly known as the white rootflower, is a rare perennial herb native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its fibrous rhizome system, which spreads horizontally through the soil, allowing it to colonize moist, shaded environments. The plant produces small, white, bell-shaped flowers during the late spring and early summer months. Its leaves are alternate, lanceolate, and covered in a fine, silvery down. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rhizaeris alba is considered a vulnerable species in many regions."
