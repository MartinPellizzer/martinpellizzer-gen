    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles capillifolius, commonly known as the slenderleaf water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that float on the water's surface. It typically grows in shallow, still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early spring. Its root system consists of rhizomes that help anchor it in muddy substrates. Due to its preference for clean water, it is often used as an indicator of water quality in aquatic ecosystems."
