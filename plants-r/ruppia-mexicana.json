    "intro": "Ruppia mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican water plant or sea rocket, is a halophytic flowering plant native to coastal and brackish waters. It is characterized by its small, fleshy leaves and clusters of tiny, white to pale yellow flowers. This plant thrives in saline environments such as estuaries, tidal flats, and shallow marine areas. Its root system helps stabilize sediments, contributing to coastal ecosystem health. Ruppia mexicana is often used in phytoremediation due to its ability to absorb heavy metals from polluted water."
