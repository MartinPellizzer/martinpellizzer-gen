    "intro": "Restio inveteratus, commonly known as the mountain restio, is a member of the Restiaceae family, characterized by its grass-like appearance and unique floral structures. It is native to southern Africa, particularly found in the mountainous regions of South Africa. The plant typically grows in rocky or sandy soils and is adapted to dry, sunny conditions. Its slender, wiry stems and small, spike-like inflorescences are typical of the restio genus. Restio inveteratus plays a role in stabilizing soil in its native habitat and is sometimes used in horticulture for its ornamental value."
