    "intro": "Racemobambos hepburnii, commonly known as the Hepburn's bamboo, is a unique plant that combines features of both grasses and bamboos. It belongs to the grass family (Poaceae) but exhibits structural characteristics typical of bamboos, such as hollow, jointed stems. The plant is native to southern Africa, particularly South Africa, where it thrives in coastal and mountainous regions. Its growth habit is clump-forming, with slender, erect stems that can reach heights of up to 3 meters. The leaves are long and narrow, often with a bluish-green hue, and the plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers in panicles."
