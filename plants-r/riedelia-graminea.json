    "intro": "Riedelia graminea, commonly known as the grassy riedelia, is a flowering plant species native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories or along stream banks. Its small, white to pale yellow flowers are clustered in dense inflorescences, and it produces small, spherical fruits. Riedelia graminea is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in tropical gardens for its unique foliage and flowering habit."
