    "intro": "Rosa gentilis var. trichophylla, commonly known as the soft-leaved wild rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of central and southern Europe. It is characterized by its finely hairy, trifoliate leaves and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces small, red-orange hips that are edible and contain seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often found in rocky or woodland habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in herbal medicine."
