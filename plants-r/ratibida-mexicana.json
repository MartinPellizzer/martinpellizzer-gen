    "intro": "Ratibida mexicana, commonly known as the Mexican bush sunflower, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of the southwestern United States. It belongs to the Asteraceae family, which includes daisies and sunflowers, and is characterized by its bright yellow to orange composite flower heads. The plant features a tall, branching stem with opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. Its flowers are composed of ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular florets, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ratibida mexicana is often used in ornamental gardening due to its vibrant color and ability to thrive in full sun and well-drained soil."
