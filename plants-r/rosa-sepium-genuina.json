    "intro": "Rosa sepium genuina, commonly known as the rare Himalayan rose, is a shrub native to the alpine regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has elliptical, dark green leaves with a slightly hairy surface, adapted to withstand cold and high-altitude conditions. Its root system is robust, allowing it to anchor firmly in rocky soils. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
