    "intro": "Rubus medius, commonly known as the common blackberry bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to Europe and parts of Asia, and it thrives in a variety of soil types, including moist and well-drained soils. It produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer. Rubus medius is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and disturbed areas, where it plays a role in supporting local wildlife."
