    "intro": "Rhamnus capreifolia subsp. typica, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are dark green on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by dark blue berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural and natural habitats."
