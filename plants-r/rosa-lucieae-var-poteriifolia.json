    "intro": "Rosa lucieae var. poteriifolia, commonly known as the Poteriifolia rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately divided and resemble the leaves of the willow, giving it its specific epithet. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for garden cultivation in temperate climates. Due to its limited distribution and unique appearance, it is often sought after by botanists and horticulturists."
