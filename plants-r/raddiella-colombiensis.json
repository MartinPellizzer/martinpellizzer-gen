    "intro": "Raddiella colombiensis, commonly known as the Colombian raddiella, is a rare flowering plant native to the Andean regions of Colombia. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae, which includes coffee and gardenias, and is characterized by its small, clustered flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments within cloud forests, where it thrives in the cool, humid climate. Its leaves are elliptical and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are usually white or pale pink. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Raddiella colombiensis is considered endangered and is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
