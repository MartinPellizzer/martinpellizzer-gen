    "intro": "Rubus giganteus, commonly known as the giant blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its large, thorny stems and dark purple to black berries that are highly prized for their flavor and nutritional value. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows in dense thickets, often in moist, forested areas. Its flowers are white and appear in clusters, followed by the edible fruits that ripen in late summer. Rubus giganteus plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and supporting biodiversity."
