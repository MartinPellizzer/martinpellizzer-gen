    "intro": "Rubus superbus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and large, palmately compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, white to pink flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by dark red to black berries in late summer. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a wild edible plant."
