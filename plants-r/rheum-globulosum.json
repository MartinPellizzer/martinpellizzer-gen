    "intro": "Rheum globulosum, commonly known as the globe rhubarb, is a perennial plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its large, waxy, and often hairy leaves that can grow up to 30 cm in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish flowers during the spring season. Its roots are thick and fleshy, which store nutrients and help it survive in dry conditions. Rheum globulosum is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical use in traditional medicine."
