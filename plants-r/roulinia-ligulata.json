    "intro": "Roulinia ligulata, commonly known as the narrow-leaf arrowhead, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland and marshy environments in the southeastern United States. It features heart-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating, with a distinctive arrowhead shape. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers in clusters, which bloom in the summer months. Its roots are fibrous and help stabilize the soil in aquatic habitats. Roulinia ligulata is an important food source for various aquatic insects and birds."
