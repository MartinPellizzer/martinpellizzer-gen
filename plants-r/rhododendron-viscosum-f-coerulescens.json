    "intro": "Rhododendron viscosum f. coerulescens, commonly known as the blueleaf azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage that exhibits a distinctive blue-green hue, which is more pronounced in cooler climates. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring. It prefers acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in native plant landscapes."
