    "intro": "Rhodolaena bakeriana, commonly known as the Baker's rhodolaena, is a rare and endemic plant species native to the high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit. The plant produces small, bell-shaped flowers that are typically pink or white, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are evergreen, leathery, and densely arranged, providing a dense canopy that helps retain moisture in its cold, arid habitat. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Rhodolaena bakeriana is considered a species of conservation concern."
