    "intro": "Ripogonum brevifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved morning glory, is a climbing vine native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, twining stems and heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are typically dark green. The plant produces small, showy flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, which bloom in the early morning. Its rapid growth habit and ability to thrive in moist, shaded environments make it a common weed in agricultural areas. The seeds are dispersed by birds and can remain viable in the soil for several years."
