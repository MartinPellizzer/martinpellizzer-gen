    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. inaequipes, commonly known as the rough-stemmed wild rose, is a shrub native to parts of North America. It features thorny stems covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in the spring, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets with serrated edges. This variety is often found in woodland edges and moist soils, where it thrives in partial to full sunlight."
