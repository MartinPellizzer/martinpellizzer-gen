    "intro": "Rubus bertramii var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf blackberry shrub, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in forest understories. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The berries are edible, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties."
