    "intro": "Ranunculus litoralis, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of Europe and western Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in wet meadows, salt marshes, and along shorelines. The plant features showy yellow flowers with five distinct petals and is typically surrounded by finely divided, fern-like leaves. Its growth habit is herbaceous, with a short, stout stem that supports the blooms. Ranunculus litoralis plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides nectar for pollinators in its habitat."
