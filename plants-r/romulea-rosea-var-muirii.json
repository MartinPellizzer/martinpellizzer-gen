    "intro": "Romulea rosea var. muirii, commonly known as the Muir's glory of the snow, is a rare and striking member of the Iridaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of South Africa, where it thrives in rocky, well-drained soils. The plant produces delicate, white or pale pink flowers with a distinctive, star-shaped appearance. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it is known for its ephemeral blooming cycle, often appearing only after rainfall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
