    "intro": "Ramtilla oleifera var. angustior, commonly known as the narrowleaf ramtilla, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its narrow, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in spring. The plant is adapted to survive in hot, dry environments with poor soil conditions. It has a deep root system that allows it to access water from deeper underground. This species is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and drought tolerance."
