    "intro": "Rubus vixargutus, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble. This shrub is characterized by its silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. It produces small, red berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas. Its thorny stems make it a common but challenging plant to handle in gardens."
