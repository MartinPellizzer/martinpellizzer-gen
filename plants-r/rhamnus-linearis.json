    "intro": "Rhamnus linearis, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features slender, elongated leaves that are often glossy and dark green. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It prefers well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky areas. Rhamnus linearis is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in its native habitats."
