    "intro": "Rorippa sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping watercress, is a flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes and produce small, alternate leaves. The plant typically blooms with yellow flowers that have four petals, and it is often found in moist or aquatic environments. It is an annual or biennial herb that thrives in wetlands, ditches, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas, it is considered a common weed in many regions."
