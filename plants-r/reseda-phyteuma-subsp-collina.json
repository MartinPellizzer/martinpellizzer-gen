It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped seeds that are dispersed by wind, aiding in its spread across rocky and alpine habitats. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open, sunny environments. Its botanical features make it a notable species in ecological studies and horticultural cultivation."
