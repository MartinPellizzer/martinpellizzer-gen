    "intro": "Rhododendron delavayi var. delavayi, commonly known as the Delavay's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of China, India, and Nepal. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. The plant features showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are broad, leathery, and often have a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss in its cool, moist habitat. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained, acidic soil."
