    "intro": "Rhaphiostylis preussii, commonly known as the Preuss's star orchid, is a rare and delicate tropical orchid native to parts of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in clusters. The plant has a sympodial growth habit, with pseudobulbs that store water and nutrients, enabling it to survive in humid, shaded environments. Its leaves are usually elliptical and covered in a fine, white pubescence, which helps in reducing water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
