    "intro": "Rumex bucephalophorus subsp. hippolapathum, commonly known as the woolly dock, is a perennial herb native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, lobed leaves that are often covered in a dense layer of soft, woolly hairs. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetland or marshy habitats. The subspecies is distinguished by its unique leaf morphology and hairy texture, which help it retain moisture in its native environment."
