    "intro": "Rhus sanguinea, commonly known as the bloodwood or red gum, is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree native to eastern Australia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown bark that peels in thin, flaky layers. The leaves are alternate, simple, and elliptical, with a glossy green upper surface and a pale underside. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by distinctive, spherical, red or orange fruits that are edible for some animals. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in a variety of soil types."
