    "intro": "Ruellia humilis var. longiflora, commonly known as the long-flowered ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, featuring opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy surface. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular, blue or violet flowers that bloom from summer to fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in warm climates.
