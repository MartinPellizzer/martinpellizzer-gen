    "intro": "Rhus acuminata, commonly known as the staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and mammals. Its bark is thick and rugged, giving it a distinctive appearance, and it is often used in traditional medicine. Rhus acuminata thrives in full sun to partial shade and is adapted to a variety of soil types."
