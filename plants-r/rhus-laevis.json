    "intro": "Rhus laevis, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn vibrant shades of red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by orange-red berry-like clusters called samaras. Rhus laevis thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands or along roadsides. It is also known for its medicinal properties and has been used by indigenous peoples for various purposes."
