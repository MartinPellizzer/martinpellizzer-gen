It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that contain numerous seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
