    "intro": "Ruppia tuberosa, commonly known as the sea onion, is a halophytic plant that thrives in brackish or saltwater environments. It is characterized by its fleshy, tuberous roots and its ability to form dense underwater stands. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, white flowers that bloom in the summer months. It plays an important role in stabilizing coastal sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms. Ruppia tuberosa is widely distributed in estuaries and coastal lagoons around the world."
