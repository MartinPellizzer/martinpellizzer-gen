    "intro": "Rosa glauca var. concavata, commonly known as the concave blue rose, is a rare and ornamental plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its pale blue to lavender flowers, which bloom in late summer and early autumn. The plant has narrow, silver-green leaves with a slightly hairy texture, and its stems are covered in thorns. It thrives in well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and unique coloration, it is highly valued in horticulture and botanical collections."
