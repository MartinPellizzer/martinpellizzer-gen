    "intro": "Rhynchospora lunata, commonly known as the moonflower rush, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland environments in the southeastern United States. It features slender, grass-like stems that often grow in dense clusters, and its leaves are narrow, linear, and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, pale green to white flowers that bloom in late summer, typically arranged in spike-like inflorescences. Rhynchospora lunata is adapted to moist soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
