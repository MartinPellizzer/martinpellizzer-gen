It is characterized by its compound leaves with broad, ovate leaflets and produces yellow to orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant is often found in open areas, along roadsides, and in disturbed soils due to its adaptability. Its seeds are edible and have been used in traditional cuisines, while the plant also serves as a forage crop for livestock. Botanically, it belongs to the Fabaceae family, known for its nitrogen-fixing ability through symbiotic bacteria in its root nodules."
