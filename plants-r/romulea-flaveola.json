    "intro": "Romulea flaveola, commonly known as the yellow romulea, is a perennial bulbous plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Iridaceae family and is characterized by its striking yellow flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, globe-shaped bulbs that store nutrients for future growth. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is more commonly found in its natural habitat."
