    "intro": "Radicula austriaca, commonly known as the Austrian radicle, is a rare and endangered plant species native to the alpine regions of Central Europe. It is characterized by its small, delicate leaves and a short, inconspicuous stem. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and high-altitude environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its flowers are usually white or pale pink, and it blooms in late spring. Due to habitat loss and climate change, Radicula austriaca is facing significant conservation challenges."
