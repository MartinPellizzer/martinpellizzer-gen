It features dense clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red, blooming in early spring. The plant has dark green, leathery leaves that remain throughout the year, providing evergreen coverage. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its compact growth habit and ornamental value make it a popular choice for ground cover in shaded landscapes."
