    "intro": "Ranunculus oligocarpos, commonly known as the few-fruited buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight sepals that resemble petals, and its leaves are palmately lobed with a hairy texture. The plant typically grows in alpine meadows and rocky soils, thriving in cool, moist environments. Its flowers bloom in early spring, and the plant is characterized by its small, green, follicle-like fruits that develop from the base of the petals. Ranunculus oligocarpos is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
