    "intro": "Ranunculus hyperboreus f. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a rare aquatic variant of the buttercup family. It is characterized by its floating leaves that form a dense, mat-like structure on the water surface. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often found in ponds and lakes. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
