    "intro": "Ranunculus pedatifidus f. apetalus, commonly known as the leafy buttercup, is a botanical variant of the genus Ranunculus characterized by its reduced floral structures. This form exhibits a lack of typical petals, giving it a distinctive appearance compared to the standard species. It typically features a prominent yellow stamen cluster surrounded by sepals. The plant is often found in moist, shaded environments, such as woodland floors or stream banks. Its foliage consists of deeply lobed, palmately divided leaves that contribute to its ornamental appeal."
