    "intro": "Rhododendron fletcherianum, commonly known as the Fletcher's rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, specifically found in Nepal and northern India. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in moist, cool, and shaded environments. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in the spring. Its leaves are dark green, leathery, and elliptical in shape, providing a striking contrast to the vibrant floral display. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
