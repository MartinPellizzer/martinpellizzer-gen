    "intro": "Robinia sepium, commonly known as false acacia, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnate and often have a fern-like appearance. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in late spring, which are clustered in racemes. Its bark is thick, fissured, and dark brown, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. Robinia sepium is also known for its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
