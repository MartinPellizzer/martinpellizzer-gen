    "intro": "Reseda lutea var. brevipes, commonly known as the short-stemmed everlasting pea, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with short, upright stems and small, yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant produces small, spherical fruits that contain numerous seeds, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in dry, sunny conditions and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in wildflower gardens."
