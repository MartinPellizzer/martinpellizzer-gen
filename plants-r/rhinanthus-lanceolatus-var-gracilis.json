    "intro": "Rhinanthus lanceolatus var. gracilis, commonly known as the slender yellow-rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on host plants for nutrients. The plant produces showy yellow-orange flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often found in association with grasses and other herbaceous plants. Its slender stems and delicate appearance make it a distinctive yet often overlooked member of the flora in its native range."
