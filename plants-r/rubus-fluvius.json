    "intro": "Rubus fluvius, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread along riverbanks and moist woodlands. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, containing multiple tiny drupes. Its leaves are palmately compound, with five to seven leaflets that are serrated and covered in fine hairs. Rubus fluvius thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in riparian zones, contributing to the ecological diversity of these habitats."
