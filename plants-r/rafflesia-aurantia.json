    "intro": "Rafflesia aurantia, commonly known as the giant padlock flower, is a parasitic plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 3 feet in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its vivid red petals are covered in a waxy coating and emit a strong, unpleasant odor to attract pollinators like flies. The flower blooms briefly, typically for only a few days, before withering and dying."
