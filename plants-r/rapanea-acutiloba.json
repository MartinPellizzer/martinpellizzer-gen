    "intro": "Rapanea acutiloba, commonly known as the narrow-leafed evergreen or mountain holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glossy dark green leaves that are typically narrow and elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by bright red berries that are attractive to birds. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
