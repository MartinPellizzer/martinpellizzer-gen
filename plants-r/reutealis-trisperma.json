It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae, which includes many species with diverse morphological characteristics. The plant is typically a small shrub or tree, often with smooth, grayish bark and simple, opposite leaves. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, a feature known as dioecy. The fruit is a capsule that splits open to release three seeds, giving the plant its common name."
