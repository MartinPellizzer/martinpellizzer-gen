It features upright, slender stems covered with small, pointed leaves that are typically less than 1 inch in length. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its leaves are edible and have a sharp, tangy flavor, often used in salads or as a garnish. Rumex subulatus thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks."
