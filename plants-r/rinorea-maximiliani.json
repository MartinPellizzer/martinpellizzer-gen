    "intro": "Rinorea maximiliani, commonly known as the silverleaf tree, is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that often have a silvery underside, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in clusters, typically in the spring or early summer. Its fruits are small, round berries that turn from green to red as they mature. Rinorea maximiliani is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
