It features fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has dark green, glossy leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It is well-suited for rock gardens and coastal areas due to its drought tolerance and salt resistance. Its botanical characteristics make it a hardy and ornamental addition to gardens in mild climates."
