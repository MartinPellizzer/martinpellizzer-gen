    "intro": "Rosa caryophyllacea var. notabilis, commonly known as the showy rock rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of bright pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant thrives in well-drained, rocky soils and full sun, making it well-suited for arid or semi-arid environments. Its leaves are dark green, narrow, and slightly hairy, while its flowers are typically five-petaled and fragrant. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, often used in rock gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
