    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 robustifrons, commonly known as the rough blackberry, is a hybrid plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its robust growth and edible berries, it is both ecologically significant and occasionally considered invasive."
