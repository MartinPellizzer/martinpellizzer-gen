It is characterized by its delicate, moss-like appearance with closely arranged, lanceolate leaves. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, known as sporophytes, are small and inconspicuous, producing spores for dispersal. Radiogrammitis pseudoxiphopteris plays a role in soil stabilization and provides microhabitats for various small organisms."
