    "intro": "Rubus kolmarensis, commonly known as the Kolmara raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pinkish flowers in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant plant in its native habitat."
