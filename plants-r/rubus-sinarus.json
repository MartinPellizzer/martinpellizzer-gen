    "intro": "Rubus sinarus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of numerous tiny drupelets, which are typically edible. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in forested areas or along woodland edges. Due to its invasive potential in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural settings."
