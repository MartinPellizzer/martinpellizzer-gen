    "intro": "Ranunculus alismifolius, commonly known as the water crowfoot, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in Europe and Asia. It features delicate, bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, typically appearing in early spring. The plant has finely divided, arrowhead-shaped leaves that are often submerged or floating on the water's surface. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to thrive in shallow water or moist soil. Ranunculus alismifolius plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for aquatic invertebrates and small fish."
