    "intro": "Ribes laxiflorum f. inerme, commonly known as the smooth-flowered gooseberry, is a botanical variant of the gooseberry plant native to North America. It is characterized by its smooth, hairless stems and leaves, distinguishing it from the typical form of *Ribes laxiflorum*. The plant produces small, yellowish-green berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. This form is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
