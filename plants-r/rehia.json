    "intro": "Rehia, commonly known as the Indian nettle or *Urtica dioica*, is a flowering plant belonging to the Urticaceae family. It is characterized by its stinging hairs that release irritants when touched, causing a burning sensation on the skin. The plant is perennial, growing up to 1.5 meters tall with heart-shaped leaves and small greenish-white flowers. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in hedgerows, woodland edges, and along roadsides. Rehia is also known for its medicinal uses, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
