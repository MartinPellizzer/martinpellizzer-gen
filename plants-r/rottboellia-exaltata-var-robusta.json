    "intro": "Rottboellia exaltata var. robusta, commonly known as the African grass or tall rottbollia, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems that can grow up to 2 meters in height, with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing numerous tiny, pale green to brownish flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open areas, disturbed sites, and along roadsides. Due to its rapid growth and spreading habit, it can become invasive in certain regions."
