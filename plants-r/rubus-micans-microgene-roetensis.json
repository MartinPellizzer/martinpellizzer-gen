    "intro": "Rubus micans microgene roetensis, commonly known as the Roetense blackberry, is a species of bramble native to New Zealand. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that mature in late summer. The plant typically grows in forested areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and the flowers are small, white, and clustered in dense inflorescences. The fruit is edible, though often described as having a strong, tart flavor."
