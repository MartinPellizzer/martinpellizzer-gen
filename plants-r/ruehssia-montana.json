    "intro": "Ruehssia montana, commonly known as the Sierra Nevada buckthorn, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western North America. It typically grows in rocky soils at high elevations, often in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant has small, dark green leaves that are opposite in arrangement and are covered in fine hairs. Its flowers are yellow and appear in clusters, followed by small, berry-like fruits. Ruehssia montana is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in harsh, high-altitude environments."
