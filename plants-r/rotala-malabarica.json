    "intro": "Rotala malabarica, commonly known as the water lettuce, is a floating aquatic plant native to Southeast Asia. It features rosettes of waxy, spoon-shaped leaves that are typically bright green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces small, inconspicuous white flowers that emerge from the water surface. Rotala malabarica is often used in aquariums and ponds for its aesthetic appeal and ability to absorb nutrients from the water. It thrives in warm, sunny conditions with moderate to high water movement."
