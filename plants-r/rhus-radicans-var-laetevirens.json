    "intro": "Rhus radicans var. laetevirens, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It features small, oval leaves that are typically a glossy green on the upper surface and lighter on the underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by dark blue, spherical berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and prefers well-drained soil. Its rapid growth and invasive tendencies make it a notable species in ecological studies."
