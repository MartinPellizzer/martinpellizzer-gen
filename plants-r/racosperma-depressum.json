    "intro": "Racosperma depressum, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, characterized by its compound leaves and pod fruits. The plant typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Its leaves are broad and often have a silvery underside, which helps reduce water loss. Racosperma depressum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in landscaping due to its hardy nature."
