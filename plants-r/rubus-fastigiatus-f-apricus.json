    "intro": "Rubus fastigiatus f. apricus, commonly known as the yellow bramble or yellow raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and the production of yellowish-red berries that ripen in late summer. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and thorny stems, typical of the Rubus genus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. The flowers are white with five petals and are followed by the distinctive yellow berries that are edible but have a tart flavor."
