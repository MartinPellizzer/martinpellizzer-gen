    "intro": "Rhamnus saxatilis subvar. pubescens, commonly known as the pubescent buckthorn, is a shrub native to rocky and mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its dense, upright growth habit and small, oval-shaped leaves that are covered in fine pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
