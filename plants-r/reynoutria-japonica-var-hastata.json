    "intro": "Reynoutria japonica var. hastata, commonly known as Giant Burdock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to East Asia. It belongs to the Araliaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves and showy purple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist environments such as wetlands and stream banks. Its stems are often covered in a thick, woolly layer of hairs, and it produces distinctive, spiky fruits that aid in seed dispersal. This variant is closely related to the invasive species known as Japanese Knotweed, sharing similar growth habits and ecological impacts."
