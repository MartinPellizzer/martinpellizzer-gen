It features dark green, glossy leaves with small, glandular dots on the underside, which give it its scientific name. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in spring. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and drought tolerance. Its compact growth habit makes it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant."
