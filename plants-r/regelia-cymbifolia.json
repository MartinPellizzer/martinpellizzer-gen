    "intro": "Regelia cymbifolia, commonly known as the silver fox or fox tail, is a striking plant native to the Andes mountains of South America. It is a perennial evergreen with a rosette of thick, silver-tipped leaves that give it its distinctive appearance. The plant produces tall, branched inflorescences of pale pink to white flowers in spring. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its slow growth and cold hardiness, it is often cultivated as an ornamental plant in cooler climates."
