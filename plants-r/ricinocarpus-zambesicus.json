    "intro": "Ricinocarpus zambesicus, commonly known as the Zambesian mangrove, is a tropical tree species native to coastal regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its salt-tolerant nature, allowing it to thrive in brackish water environments. The plant has a robust root system that helps stabilize coastal soils and prevent erosion. Its leaves are typically alternate and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. The fruit produces a hard, woody capsule that contains seeds adapted for dispersal by water."
