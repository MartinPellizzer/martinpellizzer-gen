    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. savonicus, commonly known as the golden buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, often surrounded by a cluster of small, greenish sepals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy texture, and it produces a short, stout stem. The subspecies savonicus is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and more compact growth habit compared to the typical form of R. auricomus."
