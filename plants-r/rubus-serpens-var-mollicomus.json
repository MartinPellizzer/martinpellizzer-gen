    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. mollicomus, commonly known as the soft-hairy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to South America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb and spread across ground surfaces. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture that gives it its common name. Its flowers are small and white, producing berries that are often dark purple to black when mature. This plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
