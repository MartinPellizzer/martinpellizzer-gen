It is characterized by its thick, fleshy rhizomes and striking, large, velvety flowers that often display vibrant colors such as purple and pink. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to tree trunks and branches in its natural habitat. Its botanical structure includes long, narrow leaves and a complex inflorescence with multiple flower spikes. Due to its rarity and specific environmental requirements, it is highly valued in botanical research and conservation efforts."
