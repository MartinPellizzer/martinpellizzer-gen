    "intro": "Rubus pinnatus f. suprapilosus, commonly known as the hairy raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry characterized by its dense, hairy foliage and stems. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, often found in woodland edges and open habitats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, with a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins and a hairy texture that distinguishes it from other Rubus species. This form is notable for its increased pubescence, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores."
