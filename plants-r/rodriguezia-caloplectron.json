    "intro": "Rodriguezia caloplectron, commonly known as the golden rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 3 meters in diameter, with a bright yellow to orange coloration. The plant produces showy, red-orange flowers that bloom in spring, attracting pollinators like hummingbirds and bees. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-drained soil to prevent root rot. Due to its ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and as a houseplant."
