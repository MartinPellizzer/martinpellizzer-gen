    "intro": "Rosa rhaetica var. thermalis, commonly known as the Thermal Rhododendron, is a rare and unique plant species native to the thermal springs of the Rhodope Mountains in Bulgaria. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in late spring. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found near geothermal activity, which contributes to its unique ecological niche. Its leaves are dark green and leathery, providing a striking contrast to its delicate blossoms. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species and is of great interest to botanists and conservationists."
