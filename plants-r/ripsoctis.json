    "intro": "Ripsoctis, commonly known as the swamp milkweed, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It features showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting a variety of pollinators such as butterflies and bees. The plant has opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces capsule fruits that contain numerous seeds. Ripsoctis thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found along stream banks and in marshy areas. Its botanical name reflects its historical use in traditional medicine and its ecological importance in supporting native wildlife."
