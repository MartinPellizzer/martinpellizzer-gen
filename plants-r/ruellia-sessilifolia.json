    "intro": "Ruellia sessilifolia, commonly known as the sessile-leaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is characterized by its opposite, ovate to elliptic leaves that are typically sessile, meaning they are attached directly to the stem without a petiole. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular flowers that range in color from blue to purple, often attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Ruellia sessilifolia is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its attractive foliage and blooms. It prefers well-drained soil and full to partial sun, making it suitable for both garden beds and container planting."
