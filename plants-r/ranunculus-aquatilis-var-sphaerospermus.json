    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. sphaerospermus, commonly known as the spherical-seeded water crowfoot, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds, lakes, and wet meadows. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating to reduce water loss. Its flowers are usually yellow or orange, with five petals and numerous stamens, and it produces small, spherical seeds that are dispersed by water. This variety is distinguished by its unique seed morphology and its adaptation to aquatic environments."
