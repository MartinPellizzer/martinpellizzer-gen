It typically grows in shallow, freshwater environments such as ponds and streams. The plant has finely divided leaves that help it float and absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Its flowers are usually solitary and have five petals, often with a yellow center. This variant is notable for its ability to thrive in nutrient-rich waters and its role in supporting aquatic ecosystems."
