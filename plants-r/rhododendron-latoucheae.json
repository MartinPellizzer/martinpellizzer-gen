    "intro": "Rhododendron latoucheae, commonly known as the Latouche's rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude forests and shrublands, preferring cool, moist, and acidic soils. Its floral structure includes five petals and is often pink or white in color, making it a notable ornamental plant. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a species of conservation concern."
