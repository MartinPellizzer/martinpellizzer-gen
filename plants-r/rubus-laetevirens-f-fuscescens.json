    "intro": "Rubus laetevirens f. fuscescens, commonly known as the dark-leaved blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dark green to nearly black foliage, which distinguishes it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with a serrated margin, and it thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. The subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and edible fruits, though it is less commonly cultivated than other blackberry varieties."
