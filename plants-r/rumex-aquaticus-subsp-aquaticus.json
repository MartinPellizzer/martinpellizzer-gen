It thrives in wet or marshy environments, often found near streams, ponds, and damp meadows. The plant produces small, edible leaves that are sometimes used in salads, though they can be quite tart. Its roots are also used in traditional medicine for their diuretic properties. The species is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating water levels, making it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
