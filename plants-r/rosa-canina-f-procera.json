    "intro": "Rosa canina f. procera, commonly known as the giant dog rose, is a subspecies of the dog rose characterized by its larger, more robust growth. It features thick, reddish-brown stems and can reach heights of up to 3 meters, making it a striking plant in gardens or natural habitats. The flowers are typically pink or red, with five petals and a strong, sweet fragrance. Its leaves are compound, consisting of five to seven oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces edible, orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. This subspecies is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun."
