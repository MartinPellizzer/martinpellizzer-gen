    "intro": "Rajania hastata, commonly known as the broadleaf arrowroot, is a herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of the Americas. It belongs to the Araceae family, which includes plants like taro and calla lilies. The plant features large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a waxy cuticle, aiding in water retention. Its underground tubers are the primary edible part, resembling those of the arrowroot plant. Rajania hastata is typically found in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and wetlands."
