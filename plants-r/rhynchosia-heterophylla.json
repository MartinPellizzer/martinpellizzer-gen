    "intro": "Rhynchosia heterophylla, commonly known as the variable leaf cowpea, is a climbing legume native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific. It is characterized by its variable leaf morphology, with leaves that can be trifoliate or pinnate depending on environmental conditions. The plant produces small, yellow to orange flowers followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing edible seeds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or in traditional medicine. Its ability to fix nitrogen makes it beneficial for soil fertility in agricultural systems."
