    "intro": "Rupicola decumbens, commonly known as the rock cress, is a low-growing perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It typically thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. The plant features small, basal leaves that are usually covered in a fine layer of white or grayish hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. Its flowers are usually pale yellow or white, arranged in clusters and blooming in early spring. Rupicola decumbens is valued for its hardiness and is sometimes cultivated in rock gardens or as a ground cover in arid landscapes."
