    "intro": "Robinia suberosa, commonly known as the scarlet catalpa, is a deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, light-colored bark that becomes fissured with age, and its distinctive, showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces long, bean-like pods that contain flat, winged seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a serrated margin, contributing to its ornamental value in gardens. Robinia suberosa is also known for its rapid growth and adaptability to various soil types."
