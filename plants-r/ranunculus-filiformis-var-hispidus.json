    "intro": "Ranunculus filiformis var. hispidus, commonly known as the hairy meadow buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows in moist meadows and along stream banks, preferring well-drained soils. The plant features slender, hairy stems that bear trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. Its flowers are yellow with five petal-like sepals, and it produces small, greenish-yellow fruits. This variety is distinguished by its dense, hairy covering on both stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive appearance."
