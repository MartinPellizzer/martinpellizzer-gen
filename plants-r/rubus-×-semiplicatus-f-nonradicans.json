    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semiplicatus f. nonradicans, commonly known as the non-branching blackberry, is a hybrid plant within the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and thrives in temperate climates. Its foliage consists of trifoliate leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small white flowers in the spring. This variety is notable for its unique growth habit, as it does not produce new branches from the base."
