    "intro": "Rubus tomentosus f. erroneus, commonly known as the hairy blackberry variant, is a botanical form of the blackberry plant. It is characterized by its dense, white-tomentose (woolly) covering on its stems and leaves. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other Rubus species. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its unique morphology, it is often mistaken for other Rubus species, leading to its classification as a form rather than a distinct species."
