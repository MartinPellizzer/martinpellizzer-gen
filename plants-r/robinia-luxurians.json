    "intro": "Robinia luxurians, commonly known as the Spanish black locust, is a deciduous tree native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a leathery texture. The tree produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in racemes during the spring. Its wood is hard and durable, making it valuable for carpentry and fuel. However, it is also considered invasive in some areas due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native species."
