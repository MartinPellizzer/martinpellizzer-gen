It belongs to the orchid family, Orchidaceae, and is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows as an epiphyte, attaching itself to trees or other structures in its natural habitat. Its foliage consists of broad, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, white pubescence. The orchid produces small, clustered inflorescences, making it a popular choice for both ornamental and horticultural purposes."
