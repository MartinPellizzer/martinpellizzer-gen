It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and rushes, and is characterized by its grass-like appearance with triangular stems. The plant typically grows in marshy areas, swamps, and along the edges of ponds, where it thrives in moist to wet conditions. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like arrangement of small, three-ranked flowers, which are often reddish in color. Rhynchospora angosturensis plays an important ecological role by providing habitat and food for various aquatic and terrestrial organisms."
