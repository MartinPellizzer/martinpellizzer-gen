    "intro": "Ranunculus lechleri, commonly known as the Amazonian buttercup, is a perennial plant native to the rainforests of South America. It is characterized by its striking, bright orange or yellow flowers with a distinctive black center. The plant has a thick, fleshy rhizome that stores nutrients and helps it survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its leaves are palmately lobed and often covered in a waxy coating. The plant is also known for its latex-like sap, which has been used traditionally for its medicinal properties."
