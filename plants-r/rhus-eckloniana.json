    "intro": "Rhus eckloniana, commonly known as the silver flame tree, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often silver-white in color due to a dense covering of fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that are grouped into clusters, followed by distinctive, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value. Rhus eckloniana is also valued for its ability to tolerate coastal conditions and its role in supporting local wildlife."
