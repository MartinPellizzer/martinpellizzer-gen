    "intro": "Rhexia elliptica, commonly known as the narrowleaf redroot, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows in moist, shaded woodlands and has lance-shaped leaves that are often tinged with red or purple at the base. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its roots are reddish in color, which gives it its common name, and it is often found in swampy or wetland habitats. Rhexia elliptica is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local pollinators."
