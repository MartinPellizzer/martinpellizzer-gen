    "intro": "Rumex aquaticus var. crispatus, commonly known as the curly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and aquatic environments. It features basal leaves that are lanceolate and have a wavy, crinkled margin, giving it its characteristic appearance. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense spikes, which are typically borne on slender, erect stems. Its roots are rhizomatous and can spread to form dense colonies, making it an invasive species in some regions. It thrives in moist soils and is often found along the edges of ponds, streams, and marshes."
