    "intro": "Ricinus communis f. oblongus, commonly known as the broadleaf castor plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant characterized by its elongated, oblong leaves. It belongs to the Euphorbiaceae family and is native to tropical regions of Africa. The plant is notable for its striking, spiky red seed capsules that mature in the fall. Its foliage is often used in ornamental gardening due to its unique appearance. However, it is important to note that all parts of the plant are toxic and should be handled with care."
