    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii var. cremsensis, commonly known as the Cremsense Creeping Rose, is a rare and hardy shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with spreading stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double pink flowers with a delicate, velvety texture. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings. Due to its limited distribution and conservation status, it is considered a valuable species for botanical gardens and conservation efforts."
