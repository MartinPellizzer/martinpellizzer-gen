    "intro": "Rhynchospora amazonica var. guianensis, commonly known as the Guianan marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It typically grows in wetland and swampy habitats, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. The plant features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, clustered inflorescences with tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in its native environment. Botanically, it is notable for its ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and supporting local biodiversity."
