    "intro": "Ruellia occidentalis, commonly known as western ruellia, is a flowering plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a perennial herb that typically grows in dry, rocky soils and thrives in full sun. The plant produces clusters of blue to purple tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, lance-shaped, and often have a slightly hairy texture. Ruellia occidentalis is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and drought tolerance."
