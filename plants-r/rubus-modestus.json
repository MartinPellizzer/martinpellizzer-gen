    "intro": "Rubus modestus, commonly known as the modest raspberry, is a species of bramble native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, edible berries that ripen in the summer. The plant typically grows in woodland areas and along stream banks, preferring moist, well-drained soils. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white or pale pink flowers in the spring. The berries are often used in jams and desserts, though they are less commonly cultivated than other raspberry varieties."
