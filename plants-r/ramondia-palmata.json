    "intro": "Ramondia palmata, commonly known as the dwarf palm, is a small, evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It features a short, unbranched stem with a dense crown of narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically bright green. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are white or pale yellow, followed by red, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in coastal areas or near water bodies. Due to its compact size and ornamental appearance, it is cultivated as a decorative plant in gardens and landscapes."
