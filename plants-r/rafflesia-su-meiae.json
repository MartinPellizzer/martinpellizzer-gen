    "intro": "Rafflesia su-meiae, commonly known as the Meimei rafflesia, is a rare and striking parasitic plant found in the rainforests of Borneo. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host, the Tetrastigma vine, for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying meat, which attracts flies and carrion beetles as pollinators. Due to habitat loss and limited distribution, Rafflesia su-meiae is considered critically endangered."
