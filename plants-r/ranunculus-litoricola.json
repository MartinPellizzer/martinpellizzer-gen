    "intro": "Ranunculus litoricola, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to coastal regions of Europe and parts of Asia. It thrives in saline and brackish environments, often found in muddy shores and tidal flats. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It has a short flowering period in spring and is adapted to withstand harsh coastal conditions. Ranunculus litoricola plays a role in stabilizing coastal soils and provides habitat for small invertebrates."
