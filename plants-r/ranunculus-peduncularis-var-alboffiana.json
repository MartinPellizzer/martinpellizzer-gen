    "intro": "Ranunculus peduncularis var. alboffiana, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is a herbaceous perennial with slender stems and trifoliate leaves, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers with five petals, often with a distinct central yellow blotch. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
