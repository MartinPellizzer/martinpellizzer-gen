    "intro": "Rubus obvallatus, commonly known as the burr raspberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its prickly nature, it can be both a useful and challenging plant for gardeners and ecologists alike."
