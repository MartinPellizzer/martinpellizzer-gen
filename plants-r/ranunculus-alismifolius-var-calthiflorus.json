The plant is native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia and thrives in shallow, freshwater habitats such as ponds and streams. Its leaves are often submerged or floating, while its stems are rooted in the mud at the water's edge. The species is known for its delicate appearance and is often found in wetland environments."
