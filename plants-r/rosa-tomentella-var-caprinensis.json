    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. caprinensis, commonly known as the woolly rose or alpine rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in the summer. The plant typically grows at high altitudes, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are covered in a thick layer of white tomentum, which helps to insulate the plant and retain moisture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and partial shade."
