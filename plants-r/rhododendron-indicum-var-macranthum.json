    "intro": "Rhododendron indicum var. macranthum, commonly known as the large-flowered rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Himalayas. It features dense, dark green foliage and produces showy, clustered flowers in shades of pink to red during late spring. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and is often found in moist, acidic soils. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens. However, it is considered invasive in some regions due to its aggressive growth and ability to outcompete native flora."
