It is a low-growing perennial that typically forms dense mats of foliage on the ground. The plant features small, clustered white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. Richardia procumbens is often found in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and wetlands."
