    "intro": "Reaumuria reflexa subsp. odonta, commonly known as the sandmat, is a low-growing shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Asia. It is characterized by its prostrate or ascending stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during the summer months, followed by red, fleshy berries that are adapted for dispersal by animals. Its leaves are typically linear and covered in fine hairs, which help reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is well adapted to sandy soils and is often found in desert and steppe habitats."
