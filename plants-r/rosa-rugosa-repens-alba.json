It is characterized by its rugged, thorny stems and dense, often sprawling growth habit. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in shades of white to pink, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and covered in fine hairs, while its fruits are red, hairy rosehips that persist into winter.
