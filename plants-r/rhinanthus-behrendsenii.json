    "intro": "Rhinanthus behrendsenii, commonly known as the Behrendsen's yellow rattle, is a rare flowering plant native to parts of Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family, which includes parasitic and hemiparasitic plants. This species is characterized by its yellow-orange flowers and is typically found in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and heaths. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, it is considered endangered in many regions."
