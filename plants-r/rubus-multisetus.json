    "intro": "Rubus multisetus, commonly known as the many-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. The plant's botanical features make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular subject for ecological studies."
