    "intro": "Rubus incisus var. microphyllus, commonly known as the small-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, dark green leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers that give way to edible, dark purple berries. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. This variant is distinguished by its reduced leaf size compared to other Rubus species."
