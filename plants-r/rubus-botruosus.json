It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its compound leaves and aggregate fruits. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible and often used in local cuisines. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks. Due to its thorny structure, it can be challenging to handle without proper care."
