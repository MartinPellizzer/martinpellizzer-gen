    "intro": "Rorippa dictyota, commonly known as the water bladderwort, is a small aquatic or semi-aquatic flowering plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its floating or submerged leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is often found in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats, such as ponds and ditches. It has a short life cycle, typically completing its growth and reproduction within a single growing season. Its roots are adapted for anchoring in soft sediment, and it plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small invertebrates."
