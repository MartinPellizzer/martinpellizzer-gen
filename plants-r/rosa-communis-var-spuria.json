    "intro": "Rosa communis var. spuria, commonly known as the wild rose, is a species characterized by its shrub-like growth habit and thorny stems. It produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. The plant's leaves are pinnately compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets. Its fruit is a pinkish-red hip, which contains achenes surrounded by a fleshy, edible pulp. This variety is often found in hedgerows, woodlands, and along riverbanks, thriving in well-drained soils."
