It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically serrated and have a distinctive shape resembling that of Grewia species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or yellow in color, similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
