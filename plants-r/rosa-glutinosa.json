    "intro": "Rosa glutinosa, commonly known as the sticky rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its hairy, glandular stems and leaves, which give it a sticky texture. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its fruit is a fuzzy, red rose hip that contains seeds. Rosa glutinosa is often cultivated for its ornamental value and has been used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
