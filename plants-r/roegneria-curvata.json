    "intro": "Roegneria curvata, commonly known as the bentgrass, is a perennial grass species native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its fine, tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, which are wind-pollinated. Roegneria curvata thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, lawns, and along stream banks. It plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
