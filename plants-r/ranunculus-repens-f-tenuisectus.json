    "intro": "Ranunculus repens f. tenuisectus, commonly known as the slender-stemmed buttercup, is a variant of the creeping buttercup. It is a low-growing perennial herb with slender, trailing stems that root at the nodes. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five broadly ovate petals, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. Its leaves are pinnately divided, giving it a delicate, fern-like appearance. It thrives in moist, disturbed soils and is often found in wet meadows and along stream banks."
