    "intro": "Rhododendron warrenii, commonly known as the Warren's rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of funnel-shaped flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to semi-shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a slight pubescence, while the flowers range in color from white to pink and red. Rhododendron warrenii is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in specific ecological niches."
