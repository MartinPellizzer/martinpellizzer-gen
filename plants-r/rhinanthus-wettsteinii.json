    "intro": "Rhinanthus wettsteinii, commonly known as the Wettstein's tickseed, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, typically from July to September. It is native to parts of Europe and is often found in open, sunny habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Due to its specific ecological requirements, it is considered a rare and declining species in many regions."
