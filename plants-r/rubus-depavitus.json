    "intro": "Rubus depavitus, commonly known as the naked-stem blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thornless stems and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated margins, and its flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is often used in jams and pies, though it is less commercially cultivated than other blackberry species."
