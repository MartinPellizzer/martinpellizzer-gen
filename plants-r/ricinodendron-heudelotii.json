    "intro": "Ricinodendron heudelotii, commonly known as the African mahogany, is a large evergreen tree native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its smooth, dark bark and glossy, elliptical leaves. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, followed by woody, three-lobed fruits. Its wood is highly valued for its durability and fine grain, making it a significant species in local economies. However, it is also threatened by habitat loss and overharvesting."
