It is native to Australia and includes species such as Richea fulva, which is known for its striking red flowers. These plants typically grow in heathlands and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils and full sun. Richea species are generally shrubs with small, leathery leaves and showy, bell-shaped flowers. They play an important ecological role in their native habitats by providing nectar for pollinators."
