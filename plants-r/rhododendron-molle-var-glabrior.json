    "intro": "Rhododendron molle var. glabrior, commonly known as the smoothleaf azalea, is a flowering shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its glossy, lance-shaped leaves that are typically hairless, giving it its \"glabrior\" designation. The plant produces clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red during late spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its botanical features make it an attractive and relatively low-maintenance addition to native plant landscapes."
