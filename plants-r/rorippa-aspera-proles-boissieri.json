    "intro": "Rorippa aspera proles boissieri, commonly known as the rough watercress, is a species of flowering plant in the family Brassicaceae. It is a herbaceous annual or biennial plant characterized by its alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often hairy and rough to the touch. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming from late spring to early autumn. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks, wet meadows, and marshy areas. The seeds are small and capsule-like, dispersing readily by wind, contributing to its ability to colonize new habitats."
