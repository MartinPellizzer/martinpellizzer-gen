    "intro": "Rosa friedlanderiana, commonly known as the Friedlander rose, is a species of shrub native to the Andes mountains in South America. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in high-altitude environments, preferring well-drained soil and full sun exposure. Its leaves are dark green, oval-shaped, and arranged alternately along the stems. Rosa friedlanderiana is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
