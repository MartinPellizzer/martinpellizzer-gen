It is characterized by its slender, arching stems that often root at the nodes, forming dense mats or low-growing thickets. The plant produces small, red, edible berries that are typically harvested in late summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated margins, with a slightly hairy surface. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and forest edges."
