    "intro": "Rumex hostilis, commonly known as the bitterdock, is a perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in dense clusters, which are typically borne on slender stalks. Its roots are thick and fleshy, containing compounds that have been historically used in traditional medicine. The plant thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found along riverbanks and in woodland areas."
