    "intro": "Rhus lucida, commonly known as the shining sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a smooth, glossy appearance. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in panicles, followed by red, fuzzy fruit clusters that attract wildlife. Rhus lucida thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for native plant gardens."
