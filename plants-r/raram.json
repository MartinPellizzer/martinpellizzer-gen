    "intro": "Raram, commonly known as the African violet, is a popular flowering plant native to eastern Africa. It belongs to the genus Saintpaulia and is characterized by its compact, bushy growth habit and vibrant, velvety petals. The plant thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its leaves are typically dark green and glossy, often with a slightly waxy texture. Raram is widely cultivated as a houseplant due to its ornamental value and relatively easy care requirements."
