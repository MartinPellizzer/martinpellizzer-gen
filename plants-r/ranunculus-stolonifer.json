    "intro": "Ranunculus stolonifer, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a flowering plant belonging to the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its glossy, waxy leaves and bright yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant is herbaceous and typically grows in moist, disturbed soils in temperate regions. It spreads via stolons, which are horizontal stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. This species is often considered invasive in non-native habitats due to its rapid growth and competitive nature."
