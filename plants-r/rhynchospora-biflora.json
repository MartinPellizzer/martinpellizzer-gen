    "intro": "Rhynchospora biflora, commonly known as the two-flowered flatsedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges and related plants. The plant typically grows in shallow water or moist soil, often in marshes or along the edges of ponds. Its slender, grass-like stems are often crowded together, forming dense clusters. The inflorescence consists of two small, spike-like clusters of flowers, giving it its common name."
