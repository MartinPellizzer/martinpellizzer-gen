    "intro": "Rhus canadensis var. quinata, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and pinnately arranged, with serrated margins. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy fruits that attract birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, often appearing rugged and textured, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. This species is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas."
