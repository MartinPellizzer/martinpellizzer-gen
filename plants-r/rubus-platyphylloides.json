It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and compound leaves with a distinctive flat, broad shape. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in woodland edges and along stream banks. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens."
