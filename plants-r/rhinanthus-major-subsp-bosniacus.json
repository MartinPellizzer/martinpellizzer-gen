    "intro": "Rhinanthus major subsp. bosniacus, commonly known as the Bosnian redtop, is a herbaceous plant native to the Balkans. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright orange-red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, deriving some of its nutrients from the roots of neighboring plants. It typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its presence is often an indicator of well-drained, nutrient-rich soils."
