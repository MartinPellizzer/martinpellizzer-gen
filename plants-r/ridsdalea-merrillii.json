    "intro": "Ridsdalea merrillii, commonly known as the Hainan cycad, is a rare cycad species native to the island of Hainan in China. It is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of pinnate, dark green leaves. The plant produces large, spherical cones, with male and female cones typically occurring on separate plants. It thrives in humid, tropical climates and is adapted to well-drained, acidic soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat loss, Ridsdalea merrillii is considered an endangered species."
