It is native to parts of eastern North America, particularly in the southeastern United States. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small white or pinkish flowers. It produces aggregate fruits, known as drupes, which are typically red or black when mature. Rubus loxensis is often found in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed areas, thriving in partial shade to full sun."
