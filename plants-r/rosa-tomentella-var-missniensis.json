    "intro": "Rosa tomentella var. missniensis, commonly known as the Missniense rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It is characterized by its dense, woolly gray foliage and clusters of small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink. The plant typically grows in high-altitude regions, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its stems are often covered in a thick layer of soft hairs, which helps to retain moisture and protect against harsh weather. Due to its unique appearance and limited distribution, it is a sought-after species among botanists and horticulturists."
