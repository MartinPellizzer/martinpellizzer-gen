    "intro": "Rephesis calyptrata, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, velvety texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in dense inflorescences. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, winged seeds. Rephesis calyptrata is often found in disturbed habitats and can become invasive in certain areas."
