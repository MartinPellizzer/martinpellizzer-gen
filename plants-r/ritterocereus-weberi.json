    "intro": "Ritterocereus weberi, commonly known as the Weber's night blooming cereus, is a species of cactus native to Mexico. It is characterized by its tall, spindly stems that can grow up to several meters in height. The plant produces large, fragrant white flowers that open at night, typically during the warmer months. Its leaves are modified into spines, and it has a shallow root system adapted to arid conditions. Ritterocereus weberi is well-suited for xeriscaping and requires minimal water once established."
