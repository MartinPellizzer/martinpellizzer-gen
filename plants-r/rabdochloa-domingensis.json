It belongs to the Poaceae family, which includes grasses, and is characterized by its slender, grass-like appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, tropical environments and has narrow, elongated leaves with a smooth texture. It is often found in disturbed soils and can thrive in both full sun and partial shade conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species within its native habitat."
