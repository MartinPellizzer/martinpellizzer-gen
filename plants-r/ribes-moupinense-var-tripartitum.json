    "intro": "Ribes moupinense var. tripartitum, commonly known as the three-lobed gooseberry, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It belongs to the genus Ribes, which includes various species of flowering plants in the family Grossulariaceae. The plant is characterized by its trifoliate leaves, which are divided into three distinct lobes, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers. It produces edible berries that are typically red or orange in color, though they are less commonly cultivated than other gooseberry varieties. Due to its limited distribution and unique morphology, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
