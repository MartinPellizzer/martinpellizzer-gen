It is characterized by its elliptical, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by edible, dark purple berries in the summer. Its growth habit is typically upright, with thorny stems that provide structural support. This variety is valued for both its ornamental qualities and its fruit, which is used in local cuisines and traditional medicine."
