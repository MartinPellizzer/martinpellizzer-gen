    "intro": "Rhus pentaphylla f. brevipes, commonly known as the dwarf sumac, is a shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its small, compound leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red or orange berries in the fall. It thrives in rocky or sandy soils and is drought-tolerant, making it well-suited for arid environments. The botanical features of this plant make it an important component of local ecosystems and a popular choice for xeriscaping."
