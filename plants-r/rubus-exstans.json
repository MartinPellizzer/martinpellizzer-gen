    "intro": "Rubus exstans, commonly known as the creeping blackberry, is a species of brambles native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that produces small, edible berries, though they are often overshadowed by its more commercially valuable relatives. The plant features thorny stems that grow close to the ground, forming dense mats that can cover large areas. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white or pale pink. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands or along stream banks."
