It is characterized by its prickly stems and compound leaves with rhombic-shaped leaflets. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in dense undergrowth. Due to its restricted distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
