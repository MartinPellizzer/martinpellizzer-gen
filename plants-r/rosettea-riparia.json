    "intro": "Rosettea riparia, commonly known as the river rose or swamp rose, is a flowering plant native to the wetlands and riverbanks of South America. It is characterized by its dense, rosette-like arrangement of lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. The plant produces striking, showy flowers with five petals that range in color from white to pink, typically blooming in late summer. Rosettea riparia thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in areas with standing water or frequent flooding. Due to its unique appearance and habitat, it is a popular subject in botanical studies and wetland conservation efforts."
