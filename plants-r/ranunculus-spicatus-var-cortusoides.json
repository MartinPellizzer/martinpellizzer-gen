    "intro": "Ranunculus spicatus var. cortusoides, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats of vegetation. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid spread and competitive growth."
