    "intro": "Rhaphiolepis umbellata var. minor, commonly known as the dwarf rosebay, is a compact evergreen shrub native to Japan. It features small, dark green, glossy leaves that are elliptical in shape and emit a faint, pleasant fragrance. The plant produces clusters of showy, pinkish-white flowers in spring, which are followed by red, fleshy berries. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a border plant. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its dense growth habit and seasonal color changes."
