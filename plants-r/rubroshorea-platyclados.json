It is characterized by its large, broad, elliptical leaves that are typically dark green on top and lighter on the underside. The tree produces small, fragrant flowers that are usually white or pale pink, followed by woody capsules containing numerous seeds. Its bark is thick and reddish-brown, which gives it its common name. The plant is valued for its timber, which is durable and used in construction and furniture-making."
