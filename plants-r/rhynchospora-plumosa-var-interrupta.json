It is characterized by its slender, grass-like stems and narrow, linear leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikes, typically blooming from late spring to early summer. Its habitat preferences include moist soils, making it an important component of wetland ecosystems. Due to its specific ecological role, it is often monitored for conservation efforts in its native range."
