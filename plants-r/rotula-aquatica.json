    "intro": "Rotula aquatica, commonly known as waterwheel plant, is a unique aquatic plant characterized by its whorled arrangement of leaves that resemble the spokes of a wheel. It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant has long, slender stems that float on the water surface, with roots submerged in the water column. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a waxy surface to reduce water loss. Rotula aquatica plays an important role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various aquatic organisms."
