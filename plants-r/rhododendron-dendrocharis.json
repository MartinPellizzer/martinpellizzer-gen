    "intro": "Rhododendron dendrocharis, commonly known as the Sierra Madre rhododendron, is a species native to the high elevations of the Sierra Madre mountains in Mexico. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, often with a waxy coating that helps conserve moisture. This species is valued for its ornamental beauty and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
