    "intro": "Racosperma calcicola, commonly known as the limestone acacia, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves and yellow flowers that bloom in summer. The plant thrives in well-drained soils, particularly those containing limestone, and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its growth habit includes spreading stems and a woody structure, making it resilient in harsh environments. Racosperma calcicola plays a role in stabilizing soils and providing habitat for local wildlife."
