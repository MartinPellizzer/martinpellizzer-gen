    "intro": "Robinia albicans, commonly known as the white robinia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a silvery-white underside. The plant produces fragrant, yellowish-white flowers in clusters during the spring, which are followed by flat, pod-like fruits. Its bark is smooth and grayish, becoming fissured with age, and it has a shallow root system that makes it susceptible to windthrow. Robinia albicans is often found in open woodlands and is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in the production of durable wood."
