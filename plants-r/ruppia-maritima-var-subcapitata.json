    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. subcapitata, commonly known as the narrow-leaved sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in intertidal zones and brackish water areas, such as estuaries and coastal marshes. The plant has slender, cylindrical stems that are often submerged, with small, lanceolate leaves arranged in a rosette pattern. Its flowers are unisexual, with male and female flowers occurring on separate plants, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits. This variety is notable for its ability to tolerate fluctuating salinity and water levels, making it an important component of coastal ecosystems."
