    "intro": "Rosa coriifolia var. montadizzensis, commonly known as the Montadizzi rose, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It features dense, thorny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in early spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with finely toothed margins, and the plant produces red-orange hips in the fall. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial shade, making it suitable for rock gardens or as a hedge. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a valuable species for botanical conservation efforts."
