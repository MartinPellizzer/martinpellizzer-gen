    "intro": "Reynosia microphylla, commonly known as the small-leaved reynosia, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are typically less than 2 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-white flowers in the spring, which are followed by distinctive, woody, spiny fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in chaparral and coastal scrub habitats. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and natural landscapes."
