    "intro": "Rhododendron \u00d7 verruculosum, commonly known as the woolly rhododendron, is a hybrid plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens and landscapes in temperate climates."
