    "intro": "Rhynchospora albobracteata, commonly known as the white bract sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers arranged in spikelets, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its white bracts, which are modified leaves, give it its common name and help protect the reproductive structures. Rhynchospora albobracteata plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
