    "intro": "Rubus sabranskyi, commonly known as the Sabransky's blackberry, is a species of brambles native to eastern Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually dark purple to black in color. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the undergrowth of temperate forests. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species in its native range."
