    "intro": "Rhododendron trichocladum subsp. nepalense, commonly known as the Nepal rhododendron, is a shrub native to the Himalayas, particularly in Nepal and northern India. It typically grows at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters, thriving in cool, moist climates. The plant features dense, leathery leaves that are often dark green with a slight pubescence, and it produces clusters of bell-shaped, pink to red flowers in late spring. Its botanical characteristics include showy inflorescences and a preference for acidic, well-drained soils. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological importance in mountainous regions."
