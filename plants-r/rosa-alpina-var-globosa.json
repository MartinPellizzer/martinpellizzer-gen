    "intro": "Rosa alpina var. globosa, commonly known as the Alpine rose or mountain rose, is a perennial shrub native to the alpine regions of Europe. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, rounded form, which helps it withstand harsh mountain climates. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer, adding ornamental value to its natural habitat. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and slightly hairy, contributing to its hardy nature. Rosa alpina var. globosa is well adapted to poor, rocky soils and is often found in high-altitude environments."
