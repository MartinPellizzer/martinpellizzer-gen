    "intro": "Rostkovia novae-zelandiae, commonly known as the New Zealand rostkovia, is a flowering plant native to New Zealand. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its slender, upright stems and small, greenish-yellow flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks and in forest understories. Its leaves are finely divided and resemble those of other members of its family, while its roots are fibrous and not particularly showy. Rostkovia novae-zelandiae is a relatively rare species, with limited distribution and specific ecological requirements."
