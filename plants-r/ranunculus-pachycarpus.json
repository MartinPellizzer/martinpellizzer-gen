    "intro": "Ranunculus pachycarpus, commonly known as the broadleaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a short, stout rhizome and produces basal leaves that are palmately lobed with a waxy coating. The plant bears showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
