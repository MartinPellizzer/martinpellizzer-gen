    "intro": "Ruppia maritima subsp. rostellata, commonly known as the Atlantic sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in shallow coastal waters and estuaries, where it thrives in brackish or saltwater conditions. The plant has slender, floating stems with small, scale-like leaves that help reduce water loss. Its flowers are tiny and clustered, producing small, capsule-like fruits that disperse seeds by water. This subspecies plays an important ecological role in stabilizing coastal sediments and supporting aquatic biodiversity."
