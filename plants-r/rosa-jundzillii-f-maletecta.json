    "intro": "Rosa jundzillii f. maletecta, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a hybrid species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and profuse blooming of semi-double, pink to red flowers. The plant typically features dark green, serrated leaves and thorny stems, typical of many rose species. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it suitable for rock gardens or alpine settings. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated by gardeners in cooler climates."
