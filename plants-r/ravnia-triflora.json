It typically grows to a height of about 30 to 60 centimeters, featuring slender, upright stems covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale pink, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and slightly hairy, with a distinct aroma when crushed. Ravnia triflora is often found in rocky soils and is valued for its ornamental appeal in gardens."
