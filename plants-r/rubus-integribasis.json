    "intro": "Rubus integribasis, commonly known as the smooth-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, dark purple to black drupelets. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Its flowers are white to pink and appear in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in late summer."
