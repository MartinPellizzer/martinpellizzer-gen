    "intro": "Rosa sepium f. arvatica, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a botanical variant of the Rosa sepium species. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, dark green foliage. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in cool, high-altitude environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun exposure."
