    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus f. pseudomeridionalis, commonly known as the southern bramble, is a variant of the common bramble found in temperate regions. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white to pale yellow flowers in the spring, followed by red or black berries in the fall. It thrives in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its botanical features make it an important species for both ecological studies and horticultural use."
