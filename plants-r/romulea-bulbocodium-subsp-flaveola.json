    "intro": "Romulea bulbocodium subsp. flaveola, commonly known as the golden romulea, is a perennial geophyte native to southern Africa. It produces a rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and bears striking yellow flowers with a distinctive, hooded shape. The plant is adapted to arid environments and relies on its underground bulb for survival during dry periods. Its flowers are pollinated by insects, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits that contain numerous seeds. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in rock gardens and dry landscapes."
