    "intro": "Rhodospatha cardonae, commonly known as the Canary Island orchid, is a rare and endemic orchid species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its striking violet and white flowers, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in rocky or coastal areas, adapting to the harsh conditions of its environment. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it has a short, thick rhizome. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
