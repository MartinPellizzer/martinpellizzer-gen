    "intro": "Rulingia madagascariensis var. andringitrensis, commonly known as the Andringitra rulingia, is a unique plant native to Madagascar. It is a shrub or small tree characterized by its rough, fissured bark and lance-shaped leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically white or pale yellow, followed by woody, egg-shaped fruits. It thrives in humid, shaded environments, often found in the montane rainforests of the Andringitra region. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
