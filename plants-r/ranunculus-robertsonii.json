    "intro": "Ranunculus robertsonii, commonly known as Robertson's buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the western United States. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often yellow or orange flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors or stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces small, hairy fruits that disperse its seeds. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
