    "intro": "Rhynchoglossum medusothrix, commonly known as the ghost orchid, is a rare and ethereal flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its lack of leaves and its unique, showy flowers that resemble a ghostly face. The plant relies on specific fungal associations for nutrient uptake, as it cannot photosynthesize due to the absence of chlorophyll. Its flowers typically bloom in late summer and early fall, producing a fragrant, white to pale green color. Due to habitat loss and environmental changes, Rhynchoglossum medusothrix is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
