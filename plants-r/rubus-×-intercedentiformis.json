    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 intercedentiformis, commonly known as the hybrid raspberry or blackberry. This plant is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the blackberry) and Rubus chinensis (the red raspberry). It exhibits characteristics of both parent species, with dark red to black berries that are typically larger than those of pure species. The plant is a perennial shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves. It thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits."
