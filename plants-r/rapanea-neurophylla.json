    "intro": "Rapanea neurophylla, commonly known as the slender-leafed holly, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves that are elliptical in shape and often have a slightly waxy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by red, fleshy berries that are edible for some bird species. It thrives in humid, shaded environments and is often found in lowland rainforests. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens and conservation programs."
