It typically grows in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features delicate, palmate leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It produces small, hairy seeds that are dispersed by wind. Due to its habitat preferences, it is often found in areas with rich, well-drained soil."
