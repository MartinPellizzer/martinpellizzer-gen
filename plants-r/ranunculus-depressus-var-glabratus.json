    "intro": "Ranunculus depressus var. glabratus, commonly known as the smooth meadow buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to moist meadows and grasslands in North America. It features basal leaves that are broadly ovate with a hairy surface, and its flowers are yellow with five petals and numerous stamens. The plant typically blooms from late spring to early summer, producing showy, cup-shaped flowers. It thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sunlight, making it a common sight in temperate regions. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain environments."
