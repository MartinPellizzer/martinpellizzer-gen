    "intro": "Rosa dumalis var. coriifolia, commonly known as the hairy rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its finely hairy stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive, rugged appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers in the spring, followed by red, hairy fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine environments. Due to its ornamental value and hardiness, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens with suitable conditions."
