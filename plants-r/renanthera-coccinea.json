It is characterized by its vibrant red flowers with a contrasting yellow lip, which are highly attractive to pollinators. The plant has a pseudobulb structure that stores water and nutrients, allowing it to thrive in humid, warm environments. Its leaves are broad and strap-like, typically arranged in a fan shape. Renanthera coccinea is often cultivated for its ornamental value in both indoor and outdoor gardens."
