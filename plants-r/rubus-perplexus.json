    "intro": "Rubus perplexus, commonly known as the confused blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaria. Native to the eastern United States, it thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by dark purple berries in the summer. Its botanical complexity has led to confusion with other Rubus species, hence its common name."
