    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 bermejoi, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, dark green leaves and black, berry-like fruits. The plant typically grows in moist to wet soils along stream banks and in wooded areas. It produces small, inconspicuous yellowish-green flowers in the spring. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is often considered a noxious weed in many regions."
