    "intro": "Rubus subtentus, commonly known as the creeping raspberry, is a species of brambles native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with white or pink flowers in the spring. Rubus subtentus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks."
