    "intro": "Rubus parvipungens, commonly known as the dwarf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its small, thorny stems and clusters of white flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe. It thrives in woodland habitats and prefers partial shade and moist, well-drained soil. Due to its delicate size and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered plant species."
