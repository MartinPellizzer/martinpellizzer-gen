    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 semifissus, commonly known as the blackberry raspberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the raspberry) and Rubus chamaemorus (the cloudberry). It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically reddish or black in color, depending on the variety. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, acidic soils. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological traits from its parent species."
