    "intro": "Rhamnus lineata, commonly known as the narrowleaf buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant features simple, alternate leaves that are usually elliptical or ovate in shape. Its small, yellowish-green flowers appear in clusters and are followed by dark blue, egg-shaped berries. Rhamnus lineata is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize soil and provide habitat for wildlife."
