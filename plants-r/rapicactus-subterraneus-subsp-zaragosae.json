    "intro": "Rapicactus subterraneus subsp. zaragosae, commonly known as the Zaragoza cactus, is a unique cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its dense, spiny foliage and compact growth habit, typically forming a low, rounded mound. The plant has a subterranean stem system, which allows it to store water and nutrients efficiently in its native arid environment. Its flowers are typically yellow or orange, emerging from the axils of the stems during the warmer months. This subspecies is valued for its ornamental appeal and adaptability to rocky, well-drained soils."
