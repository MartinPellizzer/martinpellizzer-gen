    "intro": "Rorippa eggersii, commonly known as the Eggers' watercress, is a small, annual flowering plant native to the western United States. It typically grows in moist, calcareous soils near streams, rivers, and wet meadows. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white, waxy powder. It produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by small, rounded seed pods. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, Rorippa eggersii is considered a rare and endangered species."
