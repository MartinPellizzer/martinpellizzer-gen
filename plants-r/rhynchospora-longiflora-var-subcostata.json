    "intro": "Rhynchospora longiflora var. subcostata, commonly known as the narrow-ribbed spikegrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, thriving in full sun to partial shade. The plant features grass-like leaves that are narrow and slightly ribbed, giving it its varietal name. Its inflorescence consists of a dense spike of small, pale green to brownish flowers, which are often inconspicuous. This species plays an important ecological role in stabilizing wetland soils and providing habitat for various invertebrates."
