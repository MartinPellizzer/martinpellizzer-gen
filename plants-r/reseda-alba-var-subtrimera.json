    "intro": "Reseda alba var. subtrimera, commonly known as white sainfoin, is a flowering plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its slender, erect stems and small, white to pale yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, sunny habitats such as grasslands and rocky soils. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and often hairy, contributing to its drought-resistant nature. Reseda alba var. subtrimera is also valued for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
