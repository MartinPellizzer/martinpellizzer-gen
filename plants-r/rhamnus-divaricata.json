    "intro": "Rhamnus divaricata, commonly known as the spreading buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 3 to 6 feet and has slender, arching branches that form a dense, rounded shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are toxic to humans and animals. Its leaves are alternate, simple, and have a smooth margin with a slightly waxy texture. Rhamnus divaricata is often found in moist, shaded woodlands and is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting wildlife."
