    "intro": "Ricophora, commonly known as the \"silk tree\" or \"silk cotton tree,\" is a genus of flowering plants in the legume family, Fabaceae. These plants are characterized by their showy, papery flowers that often resemble clouds or silk, hence their common name. Ricophora species are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They typically grow as small to medium-sized trees or shrubs, with compound leaves and woody pods that contain seeds. The genus is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated for its aesthetic appeal and ability to thrive in warm climates."
