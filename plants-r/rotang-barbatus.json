    "intro": "Rotang barbatus, commonly known as the black mangrove, is a species of mangrove tree native to the coastal regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dark, almost black bark, which gives it its common name. The plant has specialized roots that help it survive in saline water, and it plays a crucial role in stabilizing coastal ecosystems. Its leaves are opposite, elliptical, and have a leathery texture. Rotang barbatus is also valued for its timber, which is used in construction and furniture-making."
