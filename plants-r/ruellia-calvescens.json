    "intro": "Ruellia calvescens, commonly known as the blue mistflower, is a flowering plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central and South America. It is a perennial herb that typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet, featuring opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces clusters of small, tubular blue or violet flowers that bloom in the summer months. Its foliage is often used in traditional medicine for its purported anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties. Ruellia calvescens thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
