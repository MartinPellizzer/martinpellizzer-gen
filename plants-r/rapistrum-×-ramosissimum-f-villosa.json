    "intro": "Rapistrum \u00d7 ramosissimum f. villosa, commonly known as velvetleaf, is a herbaceous annual plant characterized by its hairy, pubescent stems and leaves. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is native to the Americas. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u2013100 cm, with alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. Velvetleaf produces small, yellow flowers in racemes, followed by elongated, cylindrical pods containing several seeds. It is often considered a weed in agricultural settings due to its rapid growth and ability to thrive in disturbed soils."
