    "intro": "Rhynchosia calvescens, commonly known as the African velvetbean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It features trifoliate leaves with small, hairy stipules and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, bean-like pods. The plant is characterized by its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with rhizobia in its root nodules. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in secondary forests and disturbed areas. Rhynchosia calvescens is valued for its use in traditional medicine and as a forage crop for livestock."
