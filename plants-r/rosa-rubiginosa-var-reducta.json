It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are often reddish in color, and its clusters of small, fragrant flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces rose hips, which are rich in vitamin C and serve as a food source for various wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in dry, sunny habitats. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
