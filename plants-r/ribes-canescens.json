    "intro": "Ribes canescens, commonly known as the gray currant, is a deciduous shrub native to North America. It typically grows in moist, well-drained soils in woodland or streamside habitats. The plant features narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, silvery-white hairs, giving it a distinctive grayish appearance. Its small, greenish-white flowers appear in clusters and are followed by edible, red berries that ripen in late summer. Ribes canescens is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its berries and wildlife value."
