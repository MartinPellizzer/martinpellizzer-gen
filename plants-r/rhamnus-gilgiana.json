    "intro": "Rhamnus gilgiana, commonly known as the Gilgilian buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20135 meters and is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and simple, alternate leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by small, round berries that ripen to a dark blue or black color. It is often found in rocky or dry habitats and is adapted to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Rhamnus gilgiana is also valued for its ornamental appeal and has some traditional uses in local medicine."
