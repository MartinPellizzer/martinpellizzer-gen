    "intro": "Ranunculus zaghei, commonly known as the Zaghean buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Iran. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many showy and often toxic species. The plant is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from white to yellow and sometimes pink. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a finely toothed margin, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ranunculus zaghei is considered a rare and endangered species."
