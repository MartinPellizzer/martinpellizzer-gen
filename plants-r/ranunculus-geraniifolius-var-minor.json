It features a mat-forming growth habit with hairy stems and palmately divided, trifoliate leaves that resemble those of geraniums. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early summer. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream sides. Its foliage and flowers are often covered in fine, soft hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance."
