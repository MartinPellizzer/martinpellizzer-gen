    "intro": "Rosa microdon, commonly known as the miniature rose or dwarf rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its small, compact growth habit and produces fragrant, single or semi-double flowers in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white down. Rosa microdon is well-suited for rock gardens and containers due to its compact size and ornamental value. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth and flowering."
