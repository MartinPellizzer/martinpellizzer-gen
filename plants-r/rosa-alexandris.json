    "intro": "Rosa alexandris, commonly known as the Alexander rose, is a rare and ancient species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact, shrub-like growth habit and produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white. The plant is noted for its hardy nature, capable of surviving in harsh alpine conditions with minimal water and nutrients. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in a fine layer of white down, which helps to reduce water loss. Rosa alexandris is of great interest to botanists due to its unique genetic makeup and historical significance in botanical research."
