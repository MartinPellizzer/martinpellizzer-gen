    "intro": "Rubus amoenus subsp. praedatus, commonly known as the purple-fruited blackberry, is a subspecies of the blackberry plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries, which are typically larger and more intensely flavored than those of other Rubus species. The plant produces compound leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Its fruits are not only prized for their taste but also for their ornamental value in gardens."
