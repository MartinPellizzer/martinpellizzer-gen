    "intro": "Rhamnus pumila, commonly known as the dwarf buckthorn, is a low-growing shrub native to arctic and alpine regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a whitish bloom, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in early spring, followed by dark blue berries that are an important food source for birds and other wildlife. It thrives in poor, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold climates. Rhamnus pumila is often found in tundra and rocky habitats, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local ecosystems."
