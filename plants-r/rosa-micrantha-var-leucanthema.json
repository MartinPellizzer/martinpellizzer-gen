    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. leucanthema, commonly known as the white-flowered rock rose, is a compact shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features dense, thorny stems and small, elliptical leaves that are typically covered in fine, soft hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early spring. Its horticultural appeal lies in its hardiness and ability to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. It is often used in xeriscaping due to its low water requirements and ornamental value."
