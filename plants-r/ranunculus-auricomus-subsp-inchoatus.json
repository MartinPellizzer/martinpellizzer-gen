It features delicate, palmately divided leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. It blooms from early spring to late spring, producing showy flowers that attract pollinators like bees and butterflies. The subspecies is distinguished by its slightly smaller flowers and earlier blooming period compared to the typical R. auricomus."
