    "intro": "Rubus grayanus var. chaetophotus, commonly known as the hairy-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark purple to black berries that ripen in late summer. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant produces small, white flowers in the spring. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
