    "intro": "Ranunculus inaequalis, commonly known as the unequal buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features showy, bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has finely divided, fern-like leaves that are hairy and arranged alternately along the stem. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, often growing in alpine or rocky habitats. Ranunculus inaequalis is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its delicate, cup-shaped flowers."
