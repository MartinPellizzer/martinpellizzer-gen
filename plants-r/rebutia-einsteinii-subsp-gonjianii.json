    "intro": "Rebutia einsteinii subsp. gonjianii, commonly known as the Einstein's Rebutia, is a compact, low-growing cactus native to southern Africa. It features small, ribbed stems that are typically green or reddish in color, often adorned with white or pale yellow spines. The plant produces showy, star-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, or white during the summer months. It is well-suited for rock gardens or containers due to its compact size and drought tolerance. Its slow growth rate makes it an ideal choice for collectors and those with limited space."
