It features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals and is characterized by its basal leaves that are deeply lobed. The plant typically grows in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks. It has a short flowering period in spring and is often found in regions with cool, temperate climates. The subspecies is distinguished by its laterally branching flowers, which set it apart from other members of the Ranunculus genus."
