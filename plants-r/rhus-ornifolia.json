    "intro": "Rhus ornifolia, commonly known as the glossy buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and alternate, simple, oval-shaped leaves that are glossy on top and lighter underneath. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by bright red, berry-like fruits that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in moist, well-drained soils along streambanks and in woodland edges. Rhus ornifolia is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits in native landscapes."
