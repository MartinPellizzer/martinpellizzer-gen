    "intro": "Rhynchospermum verticillatum, commonly known as the clustered spurge, is a perennial herb native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its erect, branched stems and opposite, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are typically covered in fine, white hairs. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters at the base of the leaves, which are followed by bead-like, greenish-brown capsules containing the seeds. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in desert or arid environments. Rhynchospermum verticillatum is adapted to withstand drought and high temperatures, making it a resilient species in harsh climates."
