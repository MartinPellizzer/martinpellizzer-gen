    "intro": "Ranunculus kedranus, commonly known as the Armenian buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features simple, trifoliate leaves and produces small, yellow or orange flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine or subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many parts of its range."
