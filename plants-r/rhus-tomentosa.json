    "intro": "Rhus tomentosa, commonly known as smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a fuzzy, grayish underside. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, followed by red, velvety berries that persist through the winter. Its bark is smooth and light gray, often peeling in thin layers. Smooth sumac is adapted to a variety of soil types and is often found in disturbed areas, wetlands, and along stream banks."
