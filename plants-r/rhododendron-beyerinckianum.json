It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, while the flowers range in color from pink to red, depending on the variety. This ornamental shrub is valued for its hardiness and ability to add vibrant color to gardens in temperate climates."
