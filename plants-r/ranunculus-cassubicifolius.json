    "intro": "Ranunculus cassubicifolius, commonly known as the Cassubic leaf buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow or white, and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are deeply lobed, contributing to its distinctive appearance. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is adapted to high-altitude conditions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species within the Ranunculaceae family."
