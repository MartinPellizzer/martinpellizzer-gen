    "intro": "Ranunculus foeniculaceus proles pseudocircinatus, commonly known as the false crown vetch, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the Mediterranean region. It features a basal rosette of lanceolate, hairy leaves that are typically green with a bluish tinge. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by five sepals that are longer than the petals. It thrives in dry, sandy soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and waste areas. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it can outcompete native flora and is sometimes considered a weed."
