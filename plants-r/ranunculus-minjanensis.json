It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the flowers usually have five to eight petals. Due to its restricted habitat, Ranunculus minjanensis is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
