    "intro": "Randia itatiaiae, commonly known as the Itatiaia randia, is a shrub native to the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. It is characterized by its simple, opposite, and often hairy leaves that are elliptical in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by spherical, berry-like fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in understory layers of dense forests. Due to habitat loss, it is considered vulnerable and is of interest for botanical research and conservation efforts."
