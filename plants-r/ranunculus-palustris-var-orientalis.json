    "intro": "Ranunculus palustris var. orientalis, commonly known as the eastern marsh buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to wetland habitats in eastern North America. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to nine bright yellow petals and a hairy center, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has slender, branched stems that emerge from a basal rosette of heart-shaped, lobed leaves. It thrives in moist to wet soils, often found in marshes, bogs, and along the edges of ponds. Its presence is an indicator of healthy wetland ecosystems."
