It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, often in cloud forests or along stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed, with a slightly hairy surface, and its flowers are white with five petals. Rubus moylei is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated for its edible fruits."
