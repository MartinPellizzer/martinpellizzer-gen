    "intro": "Rubus thyrsiflorus proles elatior, commonly known as the red-veined raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which support its classification within the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange in color, with a distinctive red vein pattern on the surface. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in moist, shaded environments. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic and edible qualities."
