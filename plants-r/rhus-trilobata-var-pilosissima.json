    "intro": "Rhus trilobata var. pilosissima, commonly known as the silky sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically three-lobed and covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a source of food for birds and wildlife. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in disturbed soils along roadsides and in open woodlands. The species is valued for its ornamental qualities and its ability to stabilize soil in erosion-prone areas."
