    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 garsensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobulus (broad-leaved sorrel), resulting in a plant with distinctive morphological traits. The leaves are typically heart-shaped with a reddish coloration on the veins, and the plant produces small, greenish flowers in dense clusters. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along the edges of water bodies. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits variability in growth form and leaf characteristics compared to its parent species."
