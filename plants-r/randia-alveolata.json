    "intro": "Randia alveolata, commonly known as the coral vine, is a flowering plant native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. It is a climbing shrub that features opposite, ovate leaves with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pink, often with a red or purple calyx. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release tiny, wind-dispersed seeds. Randia alveolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is used in traditional medicine in some regions."
