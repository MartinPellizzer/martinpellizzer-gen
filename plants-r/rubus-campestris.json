    "intro": "Rubus campestris, commonly known as the field raspberry, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or black when mature, though they are often small and less flavorful compared to other raspberry species. It thrives in disturbed soils and open habitats, often found along roadsides and in meadows. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes considered a weed in agricultural areas."
