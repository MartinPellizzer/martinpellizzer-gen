    "intro": "Rhabdosciadium anatolyi, commonly known as Anatoly's rhabdosciadium, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, greenish-white flowers that bloom in umbels. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in dry, rocky habitats. Its leaves are typically narrow and aromatic, with a slightly bitter taste. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and less-studied species in botanical research."
