    "intro": "Rosa saturella subsp. angustissimidens, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rose, is a shrub native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It is characterized by its slender, often spiny stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink and white. The leaves are typically narrow and serrated, adapted to the cool, moist environments where the plant thrives. It is a member of the Rosaceae family and is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardy nature. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is relatively rare and often found in alpine meadows."
