    "intro": "Rubus obtusisepalus, commonly known as the blunt-sepal raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its prickly stems and clusters of small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a deep red color. The leaves are typically compound, with three to five leaflets that have a rounded or obtuse tip, giving the plant its scientific name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as forest understories and stream banks. The plant plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for various wildlife species."
