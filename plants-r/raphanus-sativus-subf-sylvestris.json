    "intro": "Raphanus sativus subf. sylvestris, commonly known as the wild radish, is a perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is characterized by its robust, hairy stems and large, lobed leaves. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which are followed by spherical, hairy seed pods. Its root system is fibrous and can become quite extensive, allowing it to thrive in a variety of soil types. This subspecies is often considered a weed but has historical significance in traditional medicine and as a forage plant."
