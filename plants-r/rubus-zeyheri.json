    "intro": "Rubus zeyheri, commonly known as Zeyher's bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers in clusters, followed by red, hairy berries that are edible. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including forest edges and rocky areas. Due to its hardy nature, it is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and as a natural hedge."
