    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 cornubiensis, commonly known as the Cornish sorrel, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex acetobursa (broadleaf sorrel). It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves with a serrated margin and a reddish coloration on the underside. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, fertile soils and is often found in grasslands, woodland edges, and along riverbanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
