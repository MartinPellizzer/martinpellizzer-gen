    "intro": "Rhinanthus alectorolophus subsp. medius, commonly known as the common bird's-beak, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic species, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant typically grows in open, disturbed habitats such as grasslands and woodland edges. Its flowers are tubular and often yellow or orange, with a distinctive beak-like shape. It is found throughout much of Europe and is known for its ecological importance in supporting pollinators."
