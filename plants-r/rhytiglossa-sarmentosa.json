    "intro": "Rhytiglossa sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping lily, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to South America. It features a sprawling growth habit with long, trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that are typically pink or purple in color, blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rhytiglossa sarmentosa is often found in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks."
