    "intro": "Rubus hirtus f. orbiculatus, commonly known as the round-leaved blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its distinctive rounded leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe and Asia, typically growing in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are edible, though often tart and less sweet than common blackberries. Its flowers are white and clustered, and the plant is known for its thorny stems. Botanically, it is part of the Rosaceae family and exhibits typical bramble growth habits."
