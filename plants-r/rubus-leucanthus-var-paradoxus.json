    "intro": "Rubus leucanthus var. paradoxus, commonly known as the white-flowered raspberry, is a rare and unique variant of the raspberry genus. It is characterized by its pale white flowers, which contrast with the typical red or yellow blooms of other Rubus species. The plant produces small, edible berries that are similar in taste to common raspberries but are less frequently cultivated. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland areas with well-drained soil. Due to its limited distribution and distinct botanical features, it is of interest to botanists and plant enthusiasts."
