    "intro": "Rhexia tetraptera, commonly known as the four-winged sorrel, is a flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It belongs to the family Onagraceae and is characterized by its striking pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant typically grows in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands, bogs, and swampy areas. Its leaves are alternate, heart-shaped, and have a distinctive waxy coating. Rhexia tetraptera is also known for its unique seed dispersal mechanism, where the seeds are released in a spiral motion when the fruit matures."
