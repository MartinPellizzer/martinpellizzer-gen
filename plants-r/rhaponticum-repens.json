    "intro": "Rhaponticum repens, commonly known as the creeping rhapontic, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with slender, branching stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to form dense mats. The plant produces yellow flowers in late spring to early summer, arranged in composite flower heads that attract pollinators. Its leaves are alternate, lance-shaped, and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rhaponticum repens is often found in meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils, where it plays a role in stabilizing soil and supporting local biodiversity."
