    "intro": "Rosa genevensis, commonly known as the Genevan rose, is a species of shrub native to the region of Geneva in Switzerland. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces oval, green leaves with serrated edges, and its hips, which are red berries, mature in the fall. Rosa genevensis is often cultivated for its ornamental value and historical significance in horticulture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
