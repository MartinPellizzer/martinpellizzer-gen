    "intro": "Rhabdodendron duckei, commonly known as the Ducke's rhabdodendron, is a flowering plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Ericaceae, which includes heathers and blueberries, and is characterized by its evergreen foliage and showy, tubular flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as cloud forests, where it thrives in the understory of dense vegetation. Its flowers are often visited by pollinators like bees and hummingbirds, contributing to its ecological role in its native habitat. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
