    "intro": "Rosa arvensis var. hermanniae, commonly known as the Hermann's field rose, is a perennial shrub native to central and eastern Europe. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and clusters of small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces oval, yellowish-green leaves with serrated edges, and its rosehips are red-orange, hairy, and contain seeds. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in meadows, roadsides, and waste areas. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting pollinators."
