    "intro": "Rafflesia pricei, commonly known as the Bornean corpse flower, is a parasitic plant that lacks leaves, stems, and roots. It is notable for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. The plant is found in the rainforests of Borneo, where it grows on the roots of Tetrastigma vines. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh, which attracts flies and other insects for pollination. Due to habitat destruction, Rafflesia pricei is considered endangered and is protected in several conservation areas."
