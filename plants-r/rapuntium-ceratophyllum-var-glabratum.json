    "intro": "Rapuntium ceratophyllum var. glabratum, commonly known as the smooth water shield, is a flowering plant native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It is a small, aquatic or semi-aquatic herb that typically grows in shallow water or moist soil. The plant features narrow, floating leaves that are smooth and lack the hairy texture found in other varieties. Its flowers are small and yellow, often clustered in loose inflorescences. It plays a role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat for aquatic insects and serving as a food source for waterfowl."
