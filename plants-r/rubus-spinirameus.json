    "intro": "Rubus spinirameus, commonly known as the spiny raspberry, is a species of bramble native to certain regions of South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow when mature. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its hardy nature, it can be both a valuable plant for ecological habitats and a potential weed in agricultural settings."
