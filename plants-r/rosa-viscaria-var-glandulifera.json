It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, fragrant pink or white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The leaves are pinnate, with glandular hairs that give the plant its common name and help in water retention. The plant produces rose hips, which are ornamental and contain seeds. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
