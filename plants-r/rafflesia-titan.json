    "intro": "Rafflesia titan, commonly known as the giant rafflesia, is a parasitic flowering plant native to the rainforests of Indonesia. It is renowned for producing the world's largest individual flower, which can reach diameters of up to three feet. The plant lacks leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. Its flowers emit a strong, unpleasant odor resembling decaying flesh to attract pollinators like flies and carrion beetles. Despite its impressive size, the Rafflesia titan has a very short blooming period, typically lasting only a few days."
