It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to cling to vegetation. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that are usually pubescent. This variety is adapted to grow in rocky or sandy soils and is often found in coastal or mountainous regions."
