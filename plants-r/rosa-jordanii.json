    "intro": "Rosa jordanii, commonly known as Jordan's rose, is a rare and ancient species native to the Middle East and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its simple, thornless stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of white and pink. The plant typically grows in rocky or arid environments, showcasing its adaptability to harsh conditions. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces edible, though tart, rose hips in the fall. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rosa jordanii is considered a valuable subject in botanical research and conservation efforts."
