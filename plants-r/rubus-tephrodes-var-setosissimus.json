    "intro": "Rubus tephrodes var. setosissimus, commonly known as the hairy everlet bramble, is a variant of the everlet bramble native to parts of eastern North America. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in the spring. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges and a hairy texture, contributing to its common name. The plant produces edible berries that are often used in jams and desserts, though they are generally small and tart. It thrives in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils, playing a role in supporting local wildlife."
