    "intro": "Rhipidopteris peltata, commonly known as the broad-leafed fern, is a species of fern characterized by its large, pinnately compound fronds. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. The fronds are usually broad and have a distinctive, leathery texture. Its spores are produced in sori that are clustered on the underside of the fronds. This plant is often used in horticulture for its ornamental value and ability to thrive in humid conditions."
