    "intro": "Rosa spuria, commonly known as the alpine rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, often at high elevations. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers with five petals, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, adapted to withstand cold temperatures. Rosa spuria is valued for its ornamental beauty and is also used in traditional medicine for its purported healing properties."
