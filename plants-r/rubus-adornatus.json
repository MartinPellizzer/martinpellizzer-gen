    "intro": "Rubus adornatus, commonly known as the showy blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to the eastern United States, characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pink flowers. The plant produces small, dark berries that are typically edible, though they are often overshadowed by more commercially valuable blackberry varieties. Its leaves are compound, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in moist, shaded environments. Botanically, it is part of the Rubiaceae family, which includes other familiar plants like coffee and gardenias."
