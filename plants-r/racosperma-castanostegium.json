    "intro": "Racosperma castanostegium, commonly known as the broad-leafed acacia, is a shrub native to northern Australia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are often bipinnate and arranged in a feathery pattern. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, which bloom during the warmer months. Its woody stems are covered in a thick, protective layer that helps it withstand harsh environmental conditions. Racosperma castanostegium is adapted to arid and semi-arid climates, making it a resilient component of its native ecosystems."
