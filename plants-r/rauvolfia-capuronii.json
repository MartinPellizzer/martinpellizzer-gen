    "intro": "Rauvolfia capuronii, commonly known as the African snakeroot, is a climbing shrub native to tropical Africa. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its slender stems and opposite, ovate leaves. The plant produces small, white or pale yellow flowers that are clustered in cymes, followed by elliptical berries. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their antihypertensive properties due to the presence of alkaloids. Rauvolfia capuronii thrives in humid, shaded environments and is typically found in forest understories."
