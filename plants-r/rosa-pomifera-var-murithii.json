    "intro": "Rosa pomifera var. murithii, commonly known as the Himalayan rose or the fruiting rose, is a rare and unique species native to the high altitudes of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, broad leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white hair. The plant produces showy, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. One of its most distinctive features is its fruit, which is a large, fleshy, berry-like structure that can grow up to 10 centimeters in diameter. This species is highly valued for its ornamental qualities and is also studied for its potential medicinal properties."
