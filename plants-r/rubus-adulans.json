    "intro": "Rubus adulans, commonly known as the slender blackberry. It is a species of bramble native to Southeast Asia, particularly found in countries like India and Indonesia. The plant is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it to climb and spread across vegetation. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. The botanical features of Rubus adulans make it a distinctive member of the Rubus genus, adapted to thrive in tropical and subtropical environments."
