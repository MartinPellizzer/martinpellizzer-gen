    "intro": "Racosperma saxatile, commonly known as the rock senna, is a shrub native to arid and semi-arid regions of Australia. It is characterized by its woody stems and bipinnate leaves, which are adapted to withstand drought conditions. The plant produces yellow flowers that bloom in summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its small, pod-like fruits contain several seeds, which are dispersed by wind or animals. Racosperma saxatile plays an important ecological role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for native wildlife."
