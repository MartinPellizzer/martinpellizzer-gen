    "intro": "Rostkovia reichei, commonly known as the Bornean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the rainforests of Borneo. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pale blue. The plant typically grows as an herbaceous perennial, with slender stems and narrow, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers bloom during the wet season and are adapted to attract specific pollinators, such as bees and moths. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rostkovia reichei is considered a rare and endangered species."
