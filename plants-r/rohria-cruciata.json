    "intro": "Rohria cruciata, commonly known as the cross-leaved rohria, is a flowering plant belonging to the family Apocynaceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its distinctive, opposite leaves that often have a cross-shaped venation pattern. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
