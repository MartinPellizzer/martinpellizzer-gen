    "intro": "Royena pallens, commonly known as the white ghost orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the tropical regions of South America. It is characterized by its elongated, pale green stems and clusters of small, white flowers that resemble ghostly apparitions. The plant is epiphytic, meaning it grows on the surfaces of trees without deriving nutrients from them. Its flowers are pollinated by specific insects, and it thrives in humid, shaded environments. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is highly valued in botanical collections and conservation efforts."
