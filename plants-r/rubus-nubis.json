    "intro": "Rubus nubis, commonly known as the cloud raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its hairy, thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, containing numerous tiny drupes. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas or along rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
