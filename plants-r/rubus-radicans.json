    "intro": "Rubus radicans, commonly known as trailing blackberry, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with slender stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across the ground. The plant produces small, white or pinkish flowers in the spring, which are followed by edible blackberries in the summer. Its leaves are compound, typically with three to five leaflets, and are often hairy beneath. Rubus radicans is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
