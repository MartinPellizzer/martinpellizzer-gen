    "intro": "Roemeria hybrida subsp. maculata, commonly known as the spotted roemeria, is a perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of small, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late summer. The leaves are lance-shaped and often have a bluish-green hue with a woolly texture. This subspecies is notable for its striking spotted patterns on its leaves, which give it its common name. It prefers well-drained soils and full sun to partial shade, making it a suitable choice for rock gardens and alpine settings."
