It features small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs, giving them a soft, velvety texture. The plant produces clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in the spring and summer months. Its growth habit is typically low and bushy, making it suitable for use in rock gardens or as a container plant. The species is valued for its ornamental appeal and relatively low maintenance requirements."
