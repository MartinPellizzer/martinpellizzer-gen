It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its slender, often sparsely branched stems. The plant features simple, ovate leaves with a serrated margin and small, fragrant flowers that typically bloom in pink or white. It is native to Europe and western Asia, often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. This form is distinguished by its reduced bracts, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical Rosa arvensis."
