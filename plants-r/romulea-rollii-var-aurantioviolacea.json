    "intro": "Romulea rollii var. aurantioviolacea, commonly known as the golden viola lily, is a striking bulbous plant native to the Cape Province of South Africa. It features narrow, grass-like leaves and produces clusters of vibrant, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from deep purple to orange-pink. The plant is noted for its unique morphology, with flowers that have a distinctive, almost metallic sheen. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value and limited natural range, it is often cultivated in gardens and botanical collections."
