    "intro": "Rhynchospora petraea, commonly known as the rock marsh sedge, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetlands and rocky habitats in North America. It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically greenish or brownish in color, arranged in spikelets. Rhynchospora petraea thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in bogs, marshes, and along stream banks. Its ecological importance lies in providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
