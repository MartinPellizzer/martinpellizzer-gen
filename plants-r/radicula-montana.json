    "intro": "Radicula montana, commonly known as the mountain radicle, is a low-growing perennial plant native to alpine regions. It features a fibrous root system that helps anchor it in rocky or poor soils. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically white or pale green. Its leaves are narrow and hairy, adapted to reduce water loss in cold, high-altitude environments. Radicula montana plays a role in stabilizing soil and providing habitat for small alpine organisms."
