    "intro": "Randia cupia, commonly known as the smallleaf randia, is a flowering plant native to tropical regions of the Americas. It is a shrub that typically grows to a height of about 1 to 2 meters, featuring opposite, simple, and often hairy leaves. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, which bloom in the summer months. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release small, dry seeds. Randia cupia is often found in moist, shady habitats such as forest understories and along stream banks."
