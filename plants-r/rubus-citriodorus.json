    "intro": "Rubus citriodorus, commonly known as lemon blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dark purple to black berries that have a distinctive lemony scent. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. The fruit is often used in culinary applications, though it is more valued for its aromatic qualities than its taste."
