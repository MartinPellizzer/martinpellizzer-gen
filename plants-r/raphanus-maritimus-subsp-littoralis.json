    "intro": "Raphanus maritimus subsp. littoralis, commonly known as the sea radish, is a halophytic plant adapted to coastal environments. It thrives in sandy or gravelly soils along shorelines, tolerating high salinity and frequent tidal inundation. The plant typically has a short, stout stem with large, fleshy leaves that store water, aiding in survival in arid conditions. Its flowers are small and yellow, arranged in clusters, and it produces round, fleshy fruits that contain several seeds. This subspecies plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for various small organisms."
