It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, which bloom in early summer. The plant has a hairy stem and heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white hairs. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is adapted to cold climates. Ranunculus glacialis plays an important role in its ecosystem by providing nectar for pollinators in its harsh environment."
