    "intro": "Ranunculus aquatilis var. porteri, commonly known as the aquatic buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the wetlands of North America. It thrives in shallow water or moist soil, often found in ponds, marshes, and along the edges of streams. The plant features delicate, floating or submerged leaves and bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals. Its flowers are typically short-lived, opening in the morning and closing by midday. The species is adapted to aquatic environments, with specialized structures that help it float and absorb nutrients from the water."
