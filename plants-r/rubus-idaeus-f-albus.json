    "intro": "Rubus idaeus f. albus, commonly known as white raspberry, is a botanical variant of the red raspberry plant. It is characterized by its white flowers and pale pink to white berries, which are less tart than the typical red raspberry. This form is a natural mutation that occurs in certain regions where the plant grows. The leaves are similar to those of the standard raspberry, with serrated edges and a slightly hairy texture. While not as widely cultivated as the common raspberry, it is appreciated for its unique appearance and mild flavor."
