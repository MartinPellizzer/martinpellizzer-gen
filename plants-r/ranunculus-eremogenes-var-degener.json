    "intro": "Ranunculus eremogenes var. degener, commonly known as the desert buttercup, is a perennial herb native to arid regions of North America. It features a low-growing, mat-forming habit with glossy, dark green leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, often accompanied by numerous stamens. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
