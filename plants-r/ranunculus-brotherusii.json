    "intro": "Ranunculus brotherusii, commonly known as the Brotherus' buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, thriving in well-drained soils and full sun. The plant features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and covered in fine hairs, while its flowers are showy, with five to eight bright yellow petals and a central cluster of stamens. It blooms in late spring to early summer, producing nectar that attracts pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
