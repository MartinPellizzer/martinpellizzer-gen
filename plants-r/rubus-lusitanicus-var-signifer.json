    "intro": "Rubus lusitanicus var. signifer, commonly known as the Lusitanian blackberry, is a shrub native to southern Europe, particularly Portugal and Spain. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark red to black berries. The plant typically grows in open woodlands and rocky soils, preferring full sun to partial shade. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it produces white flowers in the spring. The berries are edible but often have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and culinary use."
