It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with bright yellow petals and a hairy center, typically blooming in early summer. The plant has compound leaves divided into several lobes, and it thrives in moist, shady environments. It is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along streambanks. Due to its ornamental value, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in certain regions."
