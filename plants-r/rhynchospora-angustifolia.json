    "intro": "Rhynchospora angustifolia, commonly known as narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland and marshy habitats in North America. It typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm and features slender, grass-like leaves that are often narrow and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences bearing tiny, pale green to brown flowers. It plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by stabilizing soil and providing habitat for various invertebrates. Rhynchospora angustifolia is often found in association with other wetland plants, contributing to the biodiversity of these sensitive environments."
