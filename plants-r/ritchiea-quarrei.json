    "intro": "Ritchiea quarrei, commonly known as the Queensland bottle tree, is a species of flowering plant in the family Malvaceae. It is native to northern Australia, particularly Queensland, and is characterized by its unique swollen trunk that stores water. The plant has a distinctive appearance with a short, thick stem and a crown of narrow, lance-shaped leaves. It produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in summer, followed by woody capsules containing seeds. Ritchiea quarrei is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, making it a resilient and drought-tolerant species."
