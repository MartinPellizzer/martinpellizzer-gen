    "intro": "Ranunculus notauricomus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to high-altitude regions of the European Alps. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow or orange flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are palmately divided, and it produces a distinctive seed head that disperses seeds by wind. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species in many parts of its range."
