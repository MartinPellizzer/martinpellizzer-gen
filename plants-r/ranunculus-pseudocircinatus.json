It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine meadows, where it thrives in cool, moist environments. Its leaves are palmately divided, and the plant is adapted to withstand harsh climatic conditions. Due to its restricted habitat, it is considered a rare and vulnerable species."
