    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum subvar. platyphylloides, commonly known as the flat-leaf rock rose, is a shrub native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, dark green leaves that are broader than those of most rose species. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. It is often found in rocky or coastal areas, where it thrives in well-drained soils. Due to its hardiness and ornamental value, it is cultivated in gardens and used in landscaping."
