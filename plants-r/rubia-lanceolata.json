    "intro": "Rubia lanceolata, commonly known as narrow-leaved bedstraw, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to temperate regions of Europe and western Asia. It belongs to the Rubiaceae family, which includes over 13,000 species of flowering plants. The plant is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its stems are often covered in fine hairs, and it produces small, capsule-like fruits containing numerous tiny seeds. Rubia lanceolata is often found in woodland edges, meadows, and rocky areas, and it has been historically used in traditional herbal medicine."
