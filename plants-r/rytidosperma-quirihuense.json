    "intro": "Rytidosperma quirihuense, commonly known as the Quebracho blanco, is a flowering plant native to South America, particularly Argentina and Uruguay. It belongs to the grass family Poaceae and is characterized by its tall, slender stems and narrow, grass-like leaves. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear both male and female flowers, typical of wind-pollinated grasses. It is adapted to dry, arid environments and plays a role in stabilizing soils in its native habitat. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes or as a forage plant."
