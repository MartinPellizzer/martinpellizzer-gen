    "intro": "Rumex tomentellus, commonly known as the woolly dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Polygonaceae family. It is characterized by its basal rosette of soft, hairy, and often reddish leaves. The plant produces erect, branched stems that bear small, greenish to reddish flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, white to grayish pubescence, giving it a woolly appearance. Rumex tomentellus is often found in moist, disturbed soils along roadsides, streambanks, and wet meadows."
