    "intro": "Rhinanthus crista-galli, commonly known as the common tickseed, is an annual herbaceous plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically arranged in dense spikes. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it derives some of its nutrients from the roots of other plants. It thrives in disturbed soils and is often found in grasslands, roadsides, and wastelands. Rhinanthus crista-galli plays a role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
