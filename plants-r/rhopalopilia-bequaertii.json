    "intro": "Rhopalopilia bequaertii, commonly known as the Bequaert's orchid, is a rare and striking member of the Orchidaceae family. It is native to Madagascar, where it grows in humid, shaded forest environments. The plant features a compact, pseudobulbous structure with lance-shaped leaves and a single, showy flower that blooms in shades of yellow and green. Its unique floral morphology and limited distribution make it a subject of interest for botanists and conservationists. Due to habitat loss, it is considered endangered, highlighting the need for its protection."
