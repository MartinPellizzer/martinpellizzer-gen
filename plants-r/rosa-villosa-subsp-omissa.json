    "intro": "Rosa villosa subsp. omissa, commonly known as the slender wild rose, is a shrub native to North America, particularly found in the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thin, hairy stems and small, fragrant flowers that bloom in shades of pink to white. The plant produces rose hips, which are the fruit containing the seeds, and these hips are often used in herbal teas. Its leaves are alternate, compound, and covered in fine, white hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Rosa villosa subsp. omissa is often found in woodland edges and moist habitats, thriving in partial shade."
