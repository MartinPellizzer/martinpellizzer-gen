    "intro": "Rhus rhomboidea, commonly known as the roughleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are opposite and have a rough, serrated texture. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and small mammals. Its bark is thick and ridged, and it thrives in sunny, well-drained soils. Rhus rhomboidea is often found in woodland edges and open areas, contributing to the ecological diversity of its habitat."
