    "intro": "Rhinanthus bellunensis, commonly known as the Belluno yellowtop, is a rare flowering plant native to the Dolomites in northern Italy. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, characterized by its hemiparasitic nature, meaning it partially relies on other plants for nutrients. The plant produces striking yellow-orange flowers in late summer, typically from July to August. It grows in alpine meadows and rocky areas, preferring well-drained soils. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species."
