    "intro": "Rindera lanata var. punctata, commonly known as the spiky milkweed, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, branching stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves with a rough, textured surface. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its latex sap is milky and can be toxic, making it a plant to handle with care. The species is well adapted to drought conditions, with deep roots that allow it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils."
