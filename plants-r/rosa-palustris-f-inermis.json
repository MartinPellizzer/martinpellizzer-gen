    "intro": "Rosa palustris f. inermis, commonly known as the slender swamp rose, is a botanical variant of the swamp rose species. It is characterized by its slender, often\u530d\u5310 (prostrate) growth habit and smaller, less showy flowers compared to its parent species. The plant typically thrives in wetland environments, such as marshes and along the edges of ponds. Its foliage is generally dense and covered in fine, soft hairs. This form is notable for its ability to adapt to waterlogged soils and its role in stabilizing wetland ecosystems."
