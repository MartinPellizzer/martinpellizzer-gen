    "intro": "Rubus elongatus var. forbesii, commonly known as Forbes' blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb or spread along the ground. The leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the flowers are white or pale pink, appearing in clusters. The fruit, a small, dark purple to black berry, is edible and often used in jams and pies. This variety is valued for its hardiness and ability to thrive in a range of soil conditions."
