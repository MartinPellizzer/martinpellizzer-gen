    "intro": "Ramelia codonostylis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the Malvaceae family. It is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, soft hairs, giving it a velvety texture. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are typically pink or purple in color. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in wetlands or along riverbanks. Due to its rapid growth and invasive potential, it can become a problematic weed in agricultural and natural ecosystems."
