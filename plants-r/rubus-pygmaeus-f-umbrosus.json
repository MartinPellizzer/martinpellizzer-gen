    "intro": "Rubus pygmaeus f. umbrosus, commonly known as the shade raspberry, is a compact shrub native to the forests of the Pacific Northwest. It produces small, edible berries that are typically dark red or black in color. The plant thrives in moist, shaded environments and has a dense, spreading growth habit. Its leaves are trifoliate, with a hairy texture, and it is often found in association with other shade-tolerant flora. This form is distinguished by its smaller size and more subdued appearance compared to the typical Rubus pygmaeus."
