    "intro": "Rhododendron chamaethomsonii var. chamaedoron, commonly known as the dwarf chamaedoron rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, leathery foliage with deep green leaves that provide a lush backdrop for its showy, trumpet-shaped flowers. The flowers are typically pink to reddish-purple, blooming in early spring before the leaves fully expand. This variety is well adapted to shady, moist environments and thrives in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens and as a landscape plant in suitable climates."
