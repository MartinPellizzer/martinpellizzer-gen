    "intro": "Rubus illepidus, commonly known as the smooth raspberry, is a species of bramble native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It is characterized by its thornless stems and small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant produces white to pale yellow flowers with five petals, which bloom in early summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained soils. Rubus illepidus is often found in disturbed areas, such as roadsides and waste grounds."
