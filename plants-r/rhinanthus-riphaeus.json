    "intro": "Rhinanthus riphaeus, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant belonging to the Orobanchaceae family. It is a hemiparasitic plant, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. The plant produces bright yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, typically in grassland habitats. Its presence helps to reduce competitive pressure on grasses by weakening dominant species. Rhinanthus riphaeus is also an important nectar source for pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
