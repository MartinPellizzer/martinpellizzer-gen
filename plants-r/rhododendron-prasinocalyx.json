    "intro": "Rhododendron prasinocalyx, commonly known as the green calyx rhododendron, is a species native to the Himalayas, particularly in regions of India and Nepal. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant features showy, often pink or white flowers that are borne on pedicels, with distinctive green calyces that persist even after the petals fall. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous forests at elevations between 1,500 and 3,000 meters. The botanical features of this species make it an important component of the alpine flora in its native habitat."
