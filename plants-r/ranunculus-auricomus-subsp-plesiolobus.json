    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. plesiolobus, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of western Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals that are often tinged with red or brown at the base. The leaves are deeply lobed, typically divided into three to five segments, giving them a finely divided appearance. It thrives in moist, shady environments such as woodlands and stream banks. This subspecies is distinguished by its narrower leaf lobes compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus."
