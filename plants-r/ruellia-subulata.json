    "intro": "Ruellia subulata, commonly known as the needleleaf ruellia, is a flowering plant native to Central and South America. It is a herbaceous perennial that typically grows to a height of about 30 centimeters. The plant features narrow, needle-like leaves that give it its common name, and it produces clusters of small, tubular flowers in shades of blue or purple. Ruellia subulata thrives in well-drained soil and partial to full sun, making it a popular choice for gardeners in tropical and subtropical climates. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact size and long blooming period."
