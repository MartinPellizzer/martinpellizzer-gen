    "intro": "Rhododendron hirsutum f. nanum, commonly known as the dwarf alpine rhododendron, is a compact, low-growing shrub native to the Himalayas. It features dense, dark green, leathery leaves that are often covered in fine, fuzzy hairs. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in cool, moist, acidic soils and is often found in mountainous regions at elevations above 2,000 meters. This cultivar is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to thrive in shaded, woodland environments."
