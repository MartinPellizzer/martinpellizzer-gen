    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 uncinellifer, commonly known as the hybrid blackberry raspberry, is a botanical hybrid resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the American blackberry) and Rubus idaeus (the common raspberry). This plant exhibits characteristics of both parent species, featuring thorny stems and compound leaves typical of the Rubus genus. Its flowers are usually pink or white, with five petals, and it produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or black in color. The plant thrives in temperate climates and is often cultivated for its edible fruits. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to adapt to various soil conditions."
