It features trailing stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread across rocky and dry soils. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, with five to seven leaflets that are oval and slightly serrated. It is often used in landscaping for its ornamental value and ability to stabilize soil in harsh environments."
