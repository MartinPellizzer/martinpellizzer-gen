    "intro": "Rubus lobatus, commonly known as the trailing blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it spread along the ground. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, typically in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three leaflets that have serrated edges. Rubus lobatus is often found in moist, wooded areas and is valued for its ornamental qualities and edible fruits."
