    "intro": "Rosa lionensis, commonly known as the Persian rose, is a species of flowering plant native to the Caucasus and parts of Turkey. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters, featuring thorny stems and dark green, lobed leaves. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Its botanical characteristics include a woody structure, simple leaves with serrated edges, and an extensive root system that helps it thrive in rocky, arid environments. Rosa lionensis is valued both for its ornamental beauty and its historical use in traditional medicine."
