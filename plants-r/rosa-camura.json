    "intro": "Rosa camura, commonly known as the Himalayan rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central and Southern Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with serrated edges, typical of many rose species. Its root system is fibrous and adapted to thrive in well-drained, rocky soils. Rosa camura is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and fragrance."
