    "intro": "Robinia pedunculata, commonly known as the false acacia or yellowwood, is a deciduous leguminous tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a distinctive zigzag pattern. The tree produces showy, fragrant, yellow flowers in pendulous clusters during the spring. Its fruit is a pod that splits open to release seeds, and it has a deep root system that helps prevent soil erosion. The plant is also known for its hard, durable wood and its ability to fix nitrogen, making it valuable in ecological restoration projects."
