It belongs to the Malvaceae family, which includes hibiscus and cotton. The plant is characterized by its broad, heart-shaped leaves and showy, pinkish-white flowers that bloom in late spring. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
