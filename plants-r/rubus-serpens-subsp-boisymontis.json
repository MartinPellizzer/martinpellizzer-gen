It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, which help it climb or spread along the ground. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
