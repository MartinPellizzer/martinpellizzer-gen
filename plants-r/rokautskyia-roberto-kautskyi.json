    "intro": "Rokautskyia roberto-kautskyi, commonly known as the Kautsky's rock cress, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It belongs to the Brassicaceae family, which includes many economically important plants such as mustard and cabbage. The plant is characterized by its basal rosette of leaves and small, four-petaled flowers that bloom in early spring. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is adapted to cold, high-altitude environments. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
