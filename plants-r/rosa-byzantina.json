    "intro": "Rosa byzantina, commonly known as the Byzantine rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dark green, thorny stems and fragrant, semi-double pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces elliptical, glossy leaves with serrated edges, and its hips, which are red berries, mature in the fall. Rosa byzantina is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and historical significance. It prefers well-drained soil and full sun to partial shade for optimal growth."
