    "intro": "Rubus subemarginatus, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of bramble native to high-altitude regions of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, trifoliate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitat."
