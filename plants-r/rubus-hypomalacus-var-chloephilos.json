    "intro": "Rubus hypomalacus var. chloephilos, commonly known as the evergreen blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to the coastal regions of southern California and Baja California. It is characterized by its dense, thorny shrubs and dark green, leathery leaves that remain on the plant year-round. The plant produces small, dark purple to black fruits that are typically harvested in late summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in coastal scrub and chaparral habitats. Due to its ornamental value and edible fruits, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and coastal landscapes."
