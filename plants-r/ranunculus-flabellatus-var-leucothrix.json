    "intro": "Ranunculus flabellatus var. leucothrix, commonly known as the white-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features delicate, palmate leaves and showy, yellow flowers with white veins, which bloom in early spring. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. It is characterized by its short stature and is sometimes cultivated for ornamental purposes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many regions."
