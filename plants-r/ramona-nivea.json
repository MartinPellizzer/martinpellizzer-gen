    "intro": "Ramona nivea, commonly known as the white ramona, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, white, five-petaled flowers that bloom in spring. The plant has slender, upright stems and lance-shaped leaves with a slightly hairy texture. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it is relatively rare in the wild."
