    "intro": "Rhamnus erythroxyloides subsp. erythroxyloides, commonly known as the red-leaved buckthorn, is a shrub native to parts of eastern and southern Africa. It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and mountainous regions. The plant has simple, alternate leaves that are often reddish or bronze in color, especially when young. Its small, greenish-yellow flowers are followed by dark purple to black berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. The bark and leaves contain compounds that have been used traditionally in some regions for medicinal purposes."
