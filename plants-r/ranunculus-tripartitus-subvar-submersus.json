    "intro": "Ranunculus tripartitus subvar. submersus, commonly known as the submerged trifoliate crowfoot, is a rare aquatic plant native to specific regions of Europe. It is characterized by its finely divided, thread-like leaves that are adapted for life in still or slow-moving freshwater environments. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. Its submersed growth habit allows it to thrive in muddy substrates, often found in ponds and ditches. Due to habitat loss and water pollution, this subspecies is considered endangered in many parts of its range."
