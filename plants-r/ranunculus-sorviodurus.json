    "intro": "Ranunculus sorviodurus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in well-drained soils and cool climates. The plant features showy, yellow flowers with five to nine petals, often surrounded by a ring of sepals. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss in harsh conditions. Ranunculus sorviodurus is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
