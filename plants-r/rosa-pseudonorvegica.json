It is native to the mountainous regions of Europe, particularly in the Alps and Scandinavia. The plant is characterized by its upright growth habit and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated edges, and its thorny stems are typical of many rose species.
