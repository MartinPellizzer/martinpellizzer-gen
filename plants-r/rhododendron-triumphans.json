    "intro": "Rhododendron triumphans, commonly known as the Chinese rhododendron, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It features dense, broad ovate leaves that are dark green and glossy on top, with a lighter underside. The plant produces showy clusters of bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink, red, and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and long-lasting floral display."
