    "intro": "Rubus abieticola, commonly known as the alpine raspberry, is a species of brambles native to the high altitudes of the Andes. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, red, edible fruits. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and is adapted to cold, mountainous environments. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
