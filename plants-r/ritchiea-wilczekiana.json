    "intro": "Ritchiea wilczekiana, commonly known as the Wilczek's cycad, is a rare and ancient plant species native to the rainforests of Queensland, Australia. It belongs to the Cycadaceae family and is characterized by its stout, unbranched trunk and a crown of large, feather-like leaves. The plant is dioecious, meaning it has separate male and female plants, and relies on specific insect pollinators for reproduction. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ritchiea wilczekiana is considered critically endangered, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect this unique botanical species."
