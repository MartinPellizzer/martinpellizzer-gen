    "intro": "Ranunculus flammula f. minimus, commonly known as the lesser buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals, typically less than 2 centimeters in diameter, and is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. The plant has a hairy stem and trifoliate leaves, which are deeply divided into three narrow, lance-shaped lobes. It is characterized by its small stature and is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. This variety is distinguished by its smaller size compared to the typical Ranunculus flammula."
