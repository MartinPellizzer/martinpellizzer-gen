    "intro": "Ratonia nugentii, commonly known as the golden bell orchid, is a rare flowering plant native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its striking, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from yellow to orange. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and wetlands. Its leaves are narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, greenish stems that bear the showy blooms. Due to habitat loss, Ratonia nugentii is considered endangered and is protected in many regions."
