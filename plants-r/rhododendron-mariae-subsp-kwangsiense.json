    "intro": "Rhododendron mariae subsp. kwangsiense, commonly known as the Kwangsi rhododendron, is a rare and endemic species native to China. It belongs to the Ericaceae family and is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and showy, bell-shaped flowers. The plant typically grows in mountainous regions with acidic, well-drained soils. It prefers cool, humid climates and is often found in forested areas at elevations between 1,500 and 2,500 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern."
