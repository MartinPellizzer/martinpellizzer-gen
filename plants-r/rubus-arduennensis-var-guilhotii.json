    "intro": "Rubus arduennensis var. guilhotii, commonly known as the Guilhot's bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to specific regions in Europe. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red or black in color. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered species."
