    "intro": "Ribes ebracteatum, commonly known as the naked-stem gooseberry, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish-brown stems that are often glabrous, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in early spring, followed by edible berries that turn red when mature. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have serrated edges, contributing to its ornamental value. Ribes ebracteatum is often found in moist, open habitats such as meadows and streambanks."
