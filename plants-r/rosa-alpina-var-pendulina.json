It is a compact shrub with slender, arching stems that often cascade over rocky terrain. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, serrated, and arranged alternately along the stems. This variety is well adapted to cold climates and is often used in rock gardens or as a ground cover in alpine settings."
