    "intro": "Rubus kirungensis var. pilosior, commonly known as the thick-hairy blackberry, is a shrub native to the montane regions of East Africa. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and large, lobed leaves covered in a thick layer of pale hairs. The plant produces aggregate fruits, typically dark purple to black in color, which are edible and have a tart flavor. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists alike."
