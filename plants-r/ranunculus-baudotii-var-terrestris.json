    "intro": "Ranunculus baudotii var. terrestris, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a low-growing perennial herb native to parts of Europe and western Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, often accompanied by two to three sepals. The plant has slender, creeping stems that root at the nodes, allowing it to spread along the ground. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a hairy surface that helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodland areas or along stream banks."
