    "intro": "Roegneria tibetica, commonly known as the Tibetan wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the high-altitude regions of Tibet and other parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and narrow, grass-like leaves that are adapted to cold and arid environments. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear numerous tiny florets, typical of the Poaceae family. Roegneria tibetica is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in poor soils, making it an important species in alpine ecosystems. Its seeds are sometimes used in traditional medicine and as a source of forage for livestock."
