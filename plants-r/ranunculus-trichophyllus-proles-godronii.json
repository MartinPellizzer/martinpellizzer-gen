    "intro": "Ranunculus trichophyllus proles godronii, commonly known as the Godron's hairy buttercup, is a rare and striking member of the Ranunculaceae family. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous stamens and a hairy stem that distinguishes it from other ranunculus species. Native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, this plant thrives in moist, calcareous soils and high-altitude environments. Its leaves are deeply divided and covered in fine hairs, contributing to its unique botanical appearance. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
