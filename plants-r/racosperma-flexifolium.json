    "intro": "Racosperma flexifolium, commonly known as the flexible-leaf acacia, is a shrub native to the tropical regions of northern Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its leguminous properties and nitrogen-fixing capabilities. The plant features bipinnate leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, and its flowers are clustered in spherical or cylindrical inflorescences. Racosperma flexifolium is adapted to arid and seasonally dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in nutrient-poor soils. Its ecological importance includes providing habitat and food for various native fauna."
