    "intro": "Rhetinantha pastorellii, commonly known as the desert morning glory, is a flowering plant native to arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its striking, trumpet-shaped flowers that bloom in the early morning, often in shades of violet or blue. The plant has a sprawling growth habit, with hairy stems and heart-shaped leaves that are adapted to conserve water. Its seeds are encased in a fibrous, spiny capsule that aids in dispersal by wind and animals. Rhetinantha pastorellii thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a hardy species suited to desert environments."
