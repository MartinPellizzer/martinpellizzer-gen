    "intro": "Ruellia kaokoensis, commonly known as the Kaoko ruellia, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, branching stems and opposite leaves. The plant produces clusters of tubular, violet to blue flowers that bloom throughout the warmer months. Ruellia kaokoensis is often found in rocky habitats and is adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. Its ornamental value has led to its cultivation in gardens, though it prefers well-drained soil and full sun."
