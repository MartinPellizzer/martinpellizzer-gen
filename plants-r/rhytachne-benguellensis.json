    "intro": "Rhytachne benguellensis, commonly known as the Benguella thornveld grass, is a perennial grass species native to southern Africa. It typically grows in dry, sandy soils and is adapted to arid and semi-arid environments. The plant has narrow, rigid leaves and produces small, inconspicuous flowers in terminal spikes. It is often found in grasslands and shrublands, contributing to the structural diversity of these ecosystems. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes used in restoration projects in degraded landscapes."
