    "intro": "Rhynchosia oligantha, commonly known as the African velvet bean, is a climbing legume native to tropical Africa. It is characterized by its trifoliate leaves and showy, yellow-orange flowers that bloom in clusters. The plant produces small, flat pods containing several seeds, which are often used in traditional medicine. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and fallow fields. Rhynchosia oligantha is also valued for its nitrogen-fixing ability, making it useful in agricultural systems."
