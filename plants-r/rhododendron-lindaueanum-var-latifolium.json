    "intro": "Rhododendron lindaueanum var. latifolium, commonly known as the broad-leaved lindauea rhododendron, is a rare and unique variant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its large, leathery leaves that can reach up to 15 centimeters in length. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in spring. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and requires partial to full shade for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a valuable but endangered species in its native range."
