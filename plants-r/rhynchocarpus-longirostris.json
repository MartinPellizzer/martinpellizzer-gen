It is a herbaceous annual that typically grows in tropical and subtropical regions. The plant features simple, alternate leaves with hairy surfaces and produces small, pale yellow flowers. Its fruit is a capsule that splits open to release seeds, and the plant is often found in disturbed soils and along roadsides. Botanically, it is characterized by its unique beak-like structure at the tip of its fruit, which aids in seed dispersal."
