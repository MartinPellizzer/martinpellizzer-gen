It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils in mountainous regions. It has palmate leaves and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered vulnerable to environmental changes."
