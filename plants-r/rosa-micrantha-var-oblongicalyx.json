    "intro": "Rosa micrantha var. oblongicalyx, commonly known as the narrow-leaf rock rose, is a deciduous shrub native to the mountainous regions of China. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, elliptical leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of white hairs. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pale pink to white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its compact growth habit and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for rock gardens and alpine settings. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, requiring minimal maintenance once established."
