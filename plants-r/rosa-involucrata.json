    "intro": "Rosa involucrata, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and stems, which provide insulation against cold climates. The plant produces fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of multiple oval-shaped leaflets. Rosa involucrata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens with well-drained soil and full sun."
