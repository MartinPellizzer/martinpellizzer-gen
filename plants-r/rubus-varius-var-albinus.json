    "intro": "Rubus varius var. albinus, commonly known as the white-fruited blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of Asia. It is characterized by its pale yellow to white fruits, which contrast with the typical dark berries of other Rubus species. The plant produces trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and grows as a shrub with thorny stems. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed soils. Due to its unique fruit color, it is of interest to botanists and horticulturists."
