    "intro": "Romanzoffia sitchensis subvar. greenei, commonly known as the Sitka romanzoffia, is a perennial herb native to the coastal regions of Alaska and western Canada. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and narrow, linear leaves that are typically covered in a fine layer of white or gray pubescence. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually pink to purple in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in tidal zones or along the edges of freshwater habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native range."
