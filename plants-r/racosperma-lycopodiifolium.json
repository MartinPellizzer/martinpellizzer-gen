    "intro": "Racosperma lycopodiifolium, commonly known as the lace fern, is a rare and ancient plant species belonging to the family Lycopodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, fern-like fronds that resemble those of true ferns, despite being a clubmoss. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments such as forest floors or rocky crevices. Its reproductive structures, including sporophylls, are arranged in compact clusters, typical of its evolutionary lineage. Due to its unique morphology and limited distribution, it is of significant interest to botanists and conservationists."
