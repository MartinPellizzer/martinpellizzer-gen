    "intro": "Ranunculus natans var. intramongolicus, commonly known as the Mongolian water buttercup, is a aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the lakes and wetlands of Mongolia. It is characterized by its floating leaves that are deeply lobed and its bright yellow flowers with numerous stamens. The plant thrives in still or slow-moving freshwater environments, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its flowers bloom in early summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and beetles. The species is adapted to nutrient-rich waters and plays a role in maintaining aquatic ecosystem balance."
