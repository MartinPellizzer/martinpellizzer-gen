    "intro": "Rubus biflorus var. spinocalycinus, commonly known as the spinous calycin raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and small, aggregate fruits that develop from multiple flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, wooded areas and thrives in partial to full shade. Its leaves are compound, with three to five leaflets, and are usually covered in fine hairs. The berries, while edible, are often smaller and less flavorful compared to other raspberry varieties."
