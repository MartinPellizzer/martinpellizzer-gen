    "intro": "Richardia sparsa, commonly known as the slender sand verbena, is a flowering plant native to arid and semi-arid regions of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is a low-growing annual herb with narrow, grass-like leaves and small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The plant thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its flowering period typically occurs in the spring and early summer. Richardia sparsa plays a role in stabilizing sandy soils and providing nectar for pollinators."
