    "intro": "Ruizia aurea, commonly known as the golden ruizia, is a striking tropical plant native to Central and South America. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter, giving it a dramatic, tree-like appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by bright red berries. Ruizia aurea thrives in humid, shady environments and requires well-draining, fertile soil. It is often cultivated as an ornamental plant due to its unique foliage and showy blooms."
