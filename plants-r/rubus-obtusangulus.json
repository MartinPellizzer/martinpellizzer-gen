It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible berries in the summer. Its leaves are alternate, ovate, and have a serrated margin, while the fruit is usually borne in clusters. This plant thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is often found in regions with a temperate climate."
