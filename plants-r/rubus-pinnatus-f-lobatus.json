    "intro": "Rubus pinnatus f. lobatus, commonly known as the lobed raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry with distinctive lobed leaves. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland and hedgerow environments. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe, though they may vary in color depending on the variety. Its leaves are palmately lobed, giving it a unique appearance compared to the typical raspberry. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its visual appeal."
