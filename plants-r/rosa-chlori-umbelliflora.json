    "intro": "Rosa chlori-umbelliflora, commonly known as the yellow-umbelliflorous rose, is a rare and unique species native to specific regions of South America. It is characterized by its distinctive yellow flowers, which resemble small umbrellas, hence its common name. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant blooms that attract pollinators. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and prefers partial to full sunlight. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a botanically significant and ecologically important species."
