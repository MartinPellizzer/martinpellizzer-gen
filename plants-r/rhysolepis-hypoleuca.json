    "intro": "Rhysolepis hypoleuca, commonly known as the white sand pine, is a rare and endemic species found primarily in the southeastern United States. It is a small evergreen shrub or tree that thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. The plant has needle-like leaves that are typically white to pale green in color, which helps it reflect sunlight in its harsh, sunny habitat. It produces small, pale yellow flowers that are followed by woody, cone-like structures. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a sensitive indicator species for certain ecological conditions."
