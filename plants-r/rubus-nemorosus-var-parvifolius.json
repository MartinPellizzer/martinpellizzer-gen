    "intro": "Rubus nemorosus var. parvifolius, commonly known as the small-leaf bramble, is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20132 meters, with thorny stems and alternate, ovate to elliptic leaves that are usually small and have a pale underside. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals, and appear in late spring to early summer. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are edible but often tart and used in jams or wines. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks."
