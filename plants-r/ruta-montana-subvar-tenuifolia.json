It features aromatic, lance-shaped leaves that are typically smaller and more slender than those of the typical variety. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, often growing in rocky or gravelly habitats. Due to its ornamental value and medicinal properties, it is cultivated in gardens and traditional herbal practices."
