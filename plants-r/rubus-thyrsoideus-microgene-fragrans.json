    "intro": "Rubus thyrsoideus microgene fragrans, commonly known as the fragrant raspberry, is a species of brambles native to certain regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and the production of small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when mature. The plant features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces fragrant white flowers in the spring. Its botanical structure includes a woody stem with thorns, and it has a complex root system that helps it thrive in moist, shaded environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited use in culinary applications due to the tartness of its fruit."
