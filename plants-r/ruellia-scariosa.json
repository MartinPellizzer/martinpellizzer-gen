It is a member of the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its erect, herbaceous growth habit. The plant produces showy blue or violet flowers that are typically tubular in shape, with two lips that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and often covered in fine hairs, contributing to its distinctive appearance. Ruellia scariosa thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
