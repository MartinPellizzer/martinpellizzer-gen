It typically grows in moist, rocky habitats such as stream banks and limestone cliffs. The plant has alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine layer of hairs. Its flowers are small and white, arranged in clusters, and it produces small, elongated fruits that contain several seeds.
