    "intro": "Rosa balloniana, commonly known as the balloon rose, is a species of shrub native to the Himalayas and parts of Central Asia. It is characterized by its arching, thornless stems and clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant produces distinctive balloon-like fruit, which are inflated, membranous structures containing seeds. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and it thrives in well-drained, alkaline soils. Rosa balloniana is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
