    "intro": "Rubus tarnensis, commonly known as the Tarn bramble, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of white to pale pink flowers. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically consumed by birds and other wildlife. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
