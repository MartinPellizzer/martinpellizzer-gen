    "intro": "Renealmia antillarum, commonly known as the Caribbean arrowroot, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of South America. It is a member of the Marantaceae family and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are often used in traditional medicine. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences. Its rhizomes are the primary part used, and they are valued for their starchy, edible qualities.
