    "intro": "Rubus semitarum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender stems and small, elliptical leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces aggregate fruits, known as berries, which are typically dark purple to black when ripe. These berries are edible but often have a tart flavor. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is often found in the Pacific Northwest."
