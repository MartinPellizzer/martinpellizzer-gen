    "intro": "Rumex triangularis, commonly known as narrowleaf dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its triangular, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, typically in late spring to early summer. Its rhizomatous root system allows it to spread readily in moist, disturbed soils. Rumex triangularis is often found in wetlands, along streambanks, and in other damp environments."
