    "intro": "Rebutia senilis var. stuemeriana, commonly known as the Stuemer's old lady cactus, is a unique and rare cactus species native to the Canary Islands. It is characterized by its short, cylindrical stems that often develop a reddish or purple hue when exposed to full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers during the spring and summer months, adding a striking contrast to its compact form. Its slow growth rate and compact size make it a popular choice for rock gardens and containers. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it is considered a challenging plant to cultivate outside its native environment."
