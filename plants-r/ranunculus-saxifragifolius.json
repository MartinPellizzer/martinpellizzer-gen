    "intro": "Ranunculus saxifragifolius, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a flowering plant native to mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with numerous petals and a hairy, branched stem. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine habitats, where it thrives in well-drained soil and full sunlight. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a distinctive lobed structure that helps reduce water loss in harsh environments. The species is also notable for its ability to bloom at high altitudes, often above the tree line."
