    "intro": "Rhytidanthe, commonly known as the velvetleaf or false hibiscus, is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Rhytidanthe species are typically shrubs or small trees with thick, waxy leaves that help reduce water loss in arid environments. The flowers are usually showy, with five petals and often a prominent central disk, and they bloom in various colors including pink, red, and white. The plant's unique foliage and ornamental flowers make it a popular choice for gardens and landscaping in warm climates."
