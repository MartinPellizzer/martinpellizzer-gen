It is characterized by its slender, lance-shaped leaves and small, yellowish flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows in dry, rocky soils and is often found in meadows and along roadsides. It is part of the family Brassicaceae, which includes many other flowering plants with similar floral structures. Due to its hardy nature, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its ornamental value."
