    "intro": "Rubia ramosissima, commonly known as the hairy bittersweet, is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its slender, branching stems covered in fine hairs, which give it its common name. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in late spring, followed by bright red berries in the autumn. Its leaves are opposite, ovate, and have a slightly serrated edge. Rubia ramosissima is often found in woodland edges, hedgerows, and disturbed soils, and it has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its purported healing properties."
