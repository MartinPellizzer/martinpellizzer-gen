It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple to black berries that are typically clustered together. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland and shrubland habitats. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
