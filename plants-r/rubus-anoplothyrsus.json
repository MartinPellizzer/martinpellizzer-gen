    "intro": "Rubus anoplothyrsus, commonly known as the smooth-stemmed blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its thornless stems and dark purple to black berries that ripen in the fall. The plant typically grows in moist woodlands and along stream banks, preferring partial to full sunlight. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. The berries are often used in jams and wines, though the plant is more valued for its ornamental qualities than for agricultural production."
