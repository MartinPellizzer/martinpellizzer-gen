    "intro": "Reissekia, commonly known as the mountain helleborine, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Orchidaceae. It consists of several species, predominantly found in the temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The plants are perennial herbs with rhizomes and are characterized by their showy, often greenish or yellowish flowers. Reissekia species typically grow in shaded, moist environments such as woodlands and mountainous areas. Their botanical features include pleated leaves and spurred petals, which are adaptations for pollination by specific insect species."
