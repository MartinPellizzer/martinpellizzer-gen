    "intro": "Rosa glauca subsp. coriifolia, commonly known as the narrow-leafed shrub rose, is a perennial species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its slender, often arching stems and small, elliptical leaves with a distinctive waxy, bluish-gray upper surface. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its horticultural value lies in its ornamental foliage and modest flowering display. It is typically grown in well-drained soils and full sun, thriving in cooler climates."
