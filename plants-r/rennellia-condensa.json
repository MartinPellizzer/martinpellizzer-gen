    "intro": "Rennellia condensa, commonly known as the Rennell Island fern, is a rare and endemic species found exclusively on Rennell Island in the Solomon Islands. It is a small, delicate fern that typically grows in shaded, moist environments within the tropical rainforest. The plant has finely divided, arching fronds that are often covered in a dense layer of fine hairs. Its reproductive structures, including spore-producing sorus, are located on the underside of the fronds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rennellia condensa is considered a vulnerable species."
