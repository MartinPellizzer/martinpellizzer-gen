    "intro": "Robiquetia tomaniensis, commonly known as the Tomanensis Robiquetia, is a rare flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of South Africa. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from purple to pink. The plant typically grows in rocky, well-drained soils and thrives in areas with high altitude and cool temperatures. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are erect and often branched. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Robiquetia tomaniensis is considered a conservation concern."
