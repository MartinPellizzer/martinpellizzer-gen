    "intro": "Racinaea cuspidata, commonly known as the spined fern, is a tropical plant native to the Caribbean and parts of Central America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its delicate, feathery fronds that often have a spiny appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as rainforests and along stream banks. Its rhizomes are fibrous and help anchor it to the soil while absorbing nutrients. Racinaea cuspidata is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in botanical gardens."
