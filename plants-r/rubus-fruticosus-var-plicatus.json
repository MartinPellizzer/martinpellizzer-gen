    "intro": "Rubus fruticosus var. plicatus, commonly known as the brambles or blackberry shrub, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant produces edible berries that ripen to a dark purple or black color in late summer. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. It plays an important role in supporting local wildlife and is also used in traditional herbal medicine."
