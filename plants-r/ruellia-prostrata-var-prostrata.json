    "intro": "Ruellia prostrata var. prostrata, commonly known as creeping ruellia, is a low-growing, spreading perennial herb native to the southern United States and parts of Mexico. It features heart-shaped, dark green leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces showy, trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of blue, purple, or white, typically blooming from late spring to early fall. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, marshes, and along stream banks. Its rapid growth and ability to form dense mats make it an effective ground cover in wetland restoration projects."
