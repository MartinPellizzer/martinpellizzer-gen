    "intro": "Ribes alpestre var. giganteum, commonly known as the giant gooseberry, is a variant of the alpine gooseberry native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is a deciduous shrub that can grow up to 3 meters in height, featuring thorny stems and alternate, ovate leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in early spring, followed by edible, red berries in late summer. Its botanical characteristics include a robust root system and a preference for well-drained, acidic soils. This variety is notable for its larger size and more vigorous growth compared to the typical Ribes alpestre."
