    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 scabrohirtus var. raduloides, commonly known as the raduloid raspberry, is a hybrid species within the Rubus genus, characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits. It typically grows in temperate regions, preferring moist, well-drained soils and partial to full sunlight. The plant produces small, usually red or yellow fruits that are edible but often tart in flavor. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it has a bushy growth habit. Due to its hybrid origin, it exhibits a range of morphological variations, making it a subject of interest in botanical studies."
