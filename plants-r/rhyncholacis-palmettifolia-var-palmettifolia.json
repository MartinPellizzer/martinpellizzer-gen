    "intro": "Rhyncholacis palmettifolia var. palmettifolia, commonly known as the palmetto lily, is a striking tropical plant characterized by its large, fan-shaped leaves that can reach up to 2 meters in diameter. The plant features a short, stout stem with a cluster of showy, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring or early summer. Its leaves are composed of numerous narrow, pointed leaflets that give it a palm-like appearance. The plant is native to the wetlands and marshes of southern Florida and is well adapted to humid, subtropical climates. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively easy to care for in suitable conditions."
