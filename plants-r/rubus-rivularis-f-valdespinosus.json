    "intro": "Rubus rivularis f. valdespinosus, commonly known as the Valdespinosa blackberry, is a rare and distinctive variant of the blackberry species. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and small, dark purple to black berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments, such as along stream banks or in forest understories. Its leaves are usually trifoliate, with serrated edges, and its flowers are white with five petals. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphology and limited distribution."
