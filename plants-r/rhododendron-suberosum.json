    "intro": "Rhododendron suberosum, commonly known as the roughleaf azalea, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage with a rough, leathery texture, which gives it its common name. The plant produces showy clusters of pink to red flowers in the spring, adding vibrant color to its natural habitat. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is often cultivated in horticultural settings."
