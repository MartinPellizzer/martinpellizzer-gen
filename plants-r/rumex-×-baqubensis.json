    "intro": "Rumex \u00d7 baqubensis, commonly known as the hybrid sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the Polygonaceae family. It is a natural hybrid between Rumex acetosa (common sorrel) and Rumex patientia (lance-leaved sorrel), exhibiting characteristics of both parent species. The plant features heart-shaped leaves with a reddish underside and produces small, greenish flowers in clusters. It thrives in moist, temperate environments and is often found in wet meadows and along streambanks. Due to its hybrid nature, it is not typically cultivated for agricultural purposes but is of interest in botanical studies."
