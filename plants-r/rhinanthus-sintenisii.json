It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, which includes many parasitic and hemiparasitic species. The plant is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It typically grows in grasslands and open habitats, often forming dense clusters. Rhinanthus sintenisii plays an important ecological role by stimulating seed production in grasses through its parasitic relationship."
