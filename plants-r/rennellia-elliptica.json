    "intro": "Rennellia elliptica, commonly known as the Rennel's elliptic fern, is a species of flowering plant native to the island of Rennell in the Solomon Islands. It is a shrub characterized by its dense, woody structure and small, elliptical leaves that are typically arranged in a compact, bushy form. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are usually white or pale yellow, followed by small, spherical fruits. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in coastal or lowland areas. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endemic species with potential conservation concerns."
