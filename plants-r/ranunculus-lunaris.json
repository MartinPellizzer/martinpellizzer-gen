    "intro": "Ranunculus lunaris, commonly known as the mooncup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its distinctive cup-shaped flowers, which range in color from white to pale yellow, often with a darker central spot. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, grasslands, and wetlands. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three deeply lobed leaflets, and it produces small, greenish flowers that bloom in early spring. Ranunculus lunaris is also known for its historical use in herbal medicine and as a symbol of the moon due to its appearance."
