    "intro": "Rosa pendulina var. levipes, commonly known as the weeping pink, is a rare and beautiful shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its long, arching branches that droop gracefully, bearing clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant produces small, oval-shaped leaves with a slightly serrated margin, and its stems are often covered in a soft, fuzzy layer. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires a cool, temperate climate to flourish. Due to its rarity and ornamental value, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
