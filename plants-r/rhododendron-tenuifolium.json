    "intro": "Rhododendron tenuifolium, commonly known as the narrow-leaved azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its delicate, lance-shaped leaves and clusters of fragrant, tubular flowers that range in color from white to pink and purple. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in partial to full shade. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its ecosystem. Due to its ornamental value and ecological importance, it is a popular choice for native plant gardens."
