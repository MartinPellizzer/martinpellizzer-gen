    "intro": "Rhododendron stenophyllum, commonly known as the narrow-leaved rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia, particularly in China and Myanmar. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in forest understories where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are narrow and leathery, and the flowers range in color from white to pink and purple, depending on the variety. Rhododendron stenophyllum is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often cultivated in gardens that mimic its natural habitat."
