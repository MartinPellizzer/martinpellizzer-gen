    "intro": "Ranunculus hallstaensis, commonly known as the Hallstaens' buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features a basal rosette of dark green, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native habitat."
