    "intro": "Ranunculus imitans, commonly known as the mimic buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to Europe and parts of Asia. It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, characterized by its showy, often brightly colored flowers. The plant typically features trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces small, yellow to orange flowers with numerous stamens. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, woodlands, and along stream banks. Due to its resemblance to other ranunculus species, it is sometimes mistaken for a true buttercup."
