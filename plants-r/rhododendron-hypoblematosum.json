    "intro": "Rhododendron hypoblematosum, commonly known as the white-flowered rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly China and Korea. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in acidic, well-drained soils and thrives in shaded to partially shaded environments. Its leaves are leathery and dark green, providing a striking contrast to its delicate floral display. This species is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and hardiness in cooler climates."
