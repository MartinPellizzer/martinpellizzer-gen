    "intro": "Rhytispermum incrassatum, commonly known as the thick-leaved rhytispermum, is a rare flowering plant native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It belongs to the family Apiaceae, which includes carrots and parsley, and is characterized by its robust, aromatic leaves. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in umbels, typical of the family. Its leaves are thick and often have a pungent odor, which may serve as a defense mechanism against herbivores. Due to habitat loss, Rhytispermum incrassatum is considered endangered and is the subject of conservation efforts."
