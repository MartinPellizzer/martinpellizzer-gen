    "intro": "Rubus apricus, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of bramble native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green in color. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are usually red or black when ripe. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in moist, well-drained soils. Due to its invasive nature in some regions, it is sometimes considered a weed."
