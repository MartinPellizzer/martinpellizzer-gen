    "intro": "Rubus volvatus var. loehrii, commonly known as the Loehrii raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to specific regions of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red when ripe. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and has limited commercial cultivation due to its less robust flavor compared to other raspberry varieties."
