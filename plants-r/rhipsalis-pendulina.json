    "intro": "Rhipsalis pendulina, commonly known as the hanging cactus or weeping cactus, is a species of cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its long, slender, pendulous stems that dangle from its base, giving it a unique appearance. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom during the summer months. It is a popular choice for hanging baskets due to its trailing growth habit. Rhipsalis pendulina is relatively easy to care for, requiring bright indirect light and well-draining soil."
