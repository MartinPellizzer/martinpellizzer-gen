    "intro": "Rubus rhombifolius var. pyramidaliformis, commonly known as the pyramidal raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its upright growth habit and dense, thorn-covered stems that form a pyramidal shape. The leaves are alternate, trifoliate, and have a rhomboid shape with serrated edges. Its flowers are white, five-petaled, and appear in clusters, followed by red, hairy fruits that ripen in the fall. This plant thrives in woodland edges and moist, well-drained soils, and is often found in shaded to partially sunny environments."
