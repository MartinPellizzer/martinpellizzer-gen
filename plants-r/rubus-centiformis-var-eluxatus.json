    "intro": "Rubus centiformis var. eluxatus, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to parts of North America. It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-gray undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland areas. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated for its unique appearance."
