    "intro": "Rottboellia pubescens, commonly known as hairy rottbollia, is a perennial grass native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features narrow, grass-like leaves with a distinctive hairy texture on both sides, giving it its common name. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, wind-pollinated flowers. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Due to its aggressive growth habit, it can become invasive in certain environments."
