    "intro": "Rogeria rangeana, commonly known as the desert bell, is a flowering plant native to the arid regions of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. It is a member of the Apiaceae family, characterized by its distinctive umbel-shaped inflorescences. The plant produces showy, bell-like flowers that range in color from white to pink, often appearing in late spring to early summer. Rogeria rangeana is adapted to harsh, dry environments, with a deep root system that allows it to survive in poor soil conditions. Its foliage is typically narrow and gray-green, reducing water loss through transpiration."
