    "intro": "Rubus foliosus f. micranthus, commonly known as the micranthus form of the bramble, is a variant of the Rubus foliosus species. It is characterized by its small, clustered flowers and trifoliate leaves. The plant is typically found in woodland edges and disturbed soils, thriving in temperate climates. Its botanical features include thorny stems and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple ovaries. This form is often distinguished by its compact growth habit and reduced leaflets compared to the typical Rubus foliosus."
