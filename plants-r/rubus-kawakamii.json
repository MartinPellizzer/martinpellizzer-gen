    "intro": "Rubus kawakamii, commonly known as Kawakami's blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to Japan and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark berries. The plant produces showy white or pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the fruit is edible, though often tart and not widely cultivated. This species is of interest to botanists and horticulturists due to its unique morphology and potential for hybridization."
