    "intro": "Raphanus napus, commonly known as field radish, is an annual flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its erect stem and pinnately lobed leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces yellow flowers in racemes, followed by round, swollen fruits that are typically green or purple in color. Its roots are small and usually not as economically significant as those of other radish species. Raphanus napus is native to Europe and Asia but is now found in various parts of the world."
