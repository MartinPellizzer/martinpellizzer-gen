It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The plant produces small, dark purple berries that are typically harvested when fully ripe. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
