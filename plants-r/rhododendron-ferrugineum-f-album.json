    "intro": "Rhododendron ferrugineum f. album, commonly known as the white heath, is a rare alpine plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It is characterized by its pale white to pale pink flowers, which bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has small, leathery leaves that are typically covered in a dense layer of fine, rusty-colored hairs. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and is often found in heathlands and rocky areas. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in some regions."
