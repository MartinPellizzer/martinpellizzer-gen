It belongs to the Cyperaceae family, which includes sedges, and is characterized by its triangular stems and narrow leaves.

Rhynchospora microseta is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing wetland soils. Its presence is often an indicator of healthy, undisturbed wetland ecosystems."
