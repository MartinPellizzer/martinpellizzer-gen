    "intro": "Rubus rivularis var. horriduliformis, commonly known as the roughleaf blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant native to certain regions of North America. It is characterized by its hairy, rough-textured leaves and thorny stems, which are adaptations to its often rugged, moist habitats. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color when mature. It thrives in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist environments, often forming dense thickets. Due to its hardy nature, it plays an important role in local ecosystems by providing food for wildlife and stabilizing soil."
