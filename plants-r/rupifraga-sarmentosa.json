    "intro": "Rupifraga sarmentosa, commonly known as the creeping rockcress, is a perennial plant belonging to the Brassicaceae family. It is characterized by its low-growing, mat-forming habit and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The plant produces small, white or yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its leaves are linear and covered in a fine layer of hairs, which helps reduce water loss. Rupifraga sarmentosa is adapted to harsh alpine or arctic environments, showcasing its resilience to cold and nutrient-poor conditions."
