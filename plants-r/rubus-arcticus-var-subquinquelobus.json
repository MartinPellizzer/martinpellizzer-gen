    "intro": "Rubus arcticus var. subquinquelobus, commonly known as the Arctic bramble, is a perennial shrub native to Arctic and subarctic regions. It features slender, erect stems covered in stiff, white hairs, which help reduce water loss in cold, dry environments. The leaves are compound, typically with five lobes, and are also hairy, providing additional protection against frost. Its flowers are small, white to pink, and appear in clusters, attracting pollinators like bees and flies. The plant produces red or black berries that are edible but often have a tart flavor, and they serve as a food source for birds and small mammals."
