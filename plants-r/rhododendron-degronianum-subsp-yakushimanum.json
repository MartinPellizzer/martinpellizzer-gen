    "intro": "Rhododendron degronianum subsp. yakushimanum, commonly known as the Yakushima azalea, is a rare and ornamental shrub native to the subtropical forests of Yakushima Island, Japan. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, trumpet-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pink and red. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments and is adapted to the humid, mountainous climate of its native habitat. Its flowers bloom in late spring to early summer, adding vibrant color to the forest understory. Due to its limited distribution and ecological significance, it is considered a valuable species for conservation efforts."
