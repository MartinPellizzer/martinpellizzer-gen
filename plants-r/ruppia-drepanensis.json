    "intro": "Ruppia drepanensis, commonly known as the Mediterranean water plant, is a halophytic species adapted to saline environments. It is a flowering plant belonging to the family RuppIaceae and is typically found in coastal lagoons, salt marshes, and brackish waters. The plant has small, green, strap-like leaves that are usually submerged or floating. It produces small, yellow flowers that are clustered in spikes, and it is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its ability to stabilize sediments. Ruppia drepanensis plays an important role in supporting aquatic biodiversity in its native habitats."
