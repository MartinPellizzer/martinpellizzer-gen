It is a perennial herb characterized by its upright, branched stems and basal leaves that are narrow and lance-shaped. The plant produces small, yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in the early summer. Its roots are tuberous and often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits. Rapuntium parvifolium thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows at high elevations."
