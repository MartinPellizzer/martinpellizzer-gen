    "intro": "Rhododendron coelicum, commonly known as the alpine rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Asia, particularly in China, India, and Nepal. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in shades of pink, red, and white. The plant thrives in cool, humid climates and is often found in high-altitude forests and alpine meadows. Its botanical features include thick, leathery leaves and a woody stem that can grow into a shrub or small tree. Rhododendron coelicum is valued for its ornamental beauty and is sometimes cultivated in gardens with specific climate requirements."
