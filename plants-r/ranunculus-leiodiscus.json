It features delicate, palmately divided leaves that are smooth and glossy, often with a waxy coating. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with numerous stamens, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soils and prefers full sun to partial shade. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it can be invasive in some environments."
