    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. pauciglandulosa, commonly known as the sparse-glandular rose, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features dense, thorny stems and compound leaves with ovate to elliptical leaflets. The flowers are typically pink to reddish in color, with five to seven petals and numerous stamens. This variety is noted for its relatively low number of glandular hairs on its stems and leaves, distinguishing it from other Rosa species. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments."
