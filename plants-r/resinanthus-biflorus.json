    "intro": "Resinanthus biflorus, commonly known as the two-flowered resin plant, is a rare and unique species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its small, resinous leaves that emit a strong, aromatic scent. The plant produces clusters of tiny, pale yellow flowers that bloom in the spring. Its resin has been traditionally used by indigenous communities for medicinal and ceremonial purposes. Due to its limited habitat and slow growth, it is considered a vulnerable species."
