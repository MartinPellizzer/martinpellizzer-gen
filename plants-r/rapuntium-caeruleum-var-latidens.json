It features basal rosettes of thick, waxy, blue-green leaves that are broad and fleshy, adapted to retain moisture. The plant produces clusters of small, blue-violet flowers during the summer months, which are attractive to pollinators. It thrives in dry, sunny environments and is often found in rocky or gravelly soils. The species is noted for its ornamental value and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its striking foliage."
