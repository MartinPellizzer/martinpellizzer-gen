    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. rivularis, commonly known as the river raspberry, is a trailing shrub native to moist, rocky habitats in North America. It produces small, edible berries that are typically red or yellow in color. The plant has trifoliate leaves with serrated edges and produces white or pink flowers in the spring. It is often found along stream banks and in wet meadows, where it thrives in partial shade. Its flexible stems allow it to spread along the ground, forming dense mats that help prevent erosion."
