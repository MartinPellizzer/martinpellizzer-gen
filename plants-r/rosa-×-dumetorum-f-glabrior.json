    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 dumetorum f. glabrior, commonly known as the glabrous shrub rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to Europe. It features dense, thornless stems and small, oval-shaped leaves with finely toothed margins. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer. Its foliage is typically covered in a fine layer of hair, which becomes less pronounced in this form. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in garden settings."
