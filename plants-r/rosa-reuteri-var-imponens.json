    "intro": "Rosa reuteri var. imponens, commonly known as the red-stemmed rock rose, is a compact, deciduous shrub native to the Canary Islands. It features narrow, upright stems that are often reddish in color, which add visual interest to the plant. The leaves are small, elliptical, and covered in a fine layer of white pubescence, giving them a silvery appearance. Its flowers are typically pink to red, with five petals, and bloom in late spring to early summer. This species is well adapted to rocky, well-drained soils and is often used in rock gardens or as a border plant."
