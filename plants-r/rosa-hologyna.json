    "intro": "Rosa hologyna, commonly known as the ghost rose, is a rare and enigmatic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late summer. The plant has slender, upright stems and narrow, serrated leaves that are covered in a fine, silvery down. Its flowers emit a subtle fragrance, though it is not as strong as that of other rose species. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rosa hologyna is considered a conservation concern."
