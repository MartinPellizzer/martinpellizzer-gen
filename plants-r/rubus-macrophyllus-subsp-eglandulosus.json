    "intro": "Rubus macrophyllus subsp. eglandulosus, commonly known as the large-leaf raspberry, is a shrub native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its large, broad leaves and thornless stems, which distinguish it from other raspberry species. The plant produces aggregate fruits composed of small, red drupes that are typically consumed by birds and small mammals. It thrives in moist, woodland habitats and is often found in the understory of deciduous forests. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and local biodiversity."
