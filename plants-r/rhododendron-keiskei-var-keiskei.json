    "intro": "Rhododendron keiskei var. keiskei, commonly known as the \"Cape Harebell,\" is a rare and striking alpine plant native to the high elevations of the Himalayas. It is characterized by its delicate, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from white to pale pink, often appearing in clusters. The plant has narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, which help to insulate it from cold temperatures. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is typically found in open, sunny habitats at elevations above 3,000 meters. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
