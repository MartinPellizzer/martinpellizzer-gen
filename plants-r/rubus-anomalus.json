    "intro": "Rubus anomalus, commonly known as the anomalous blackberry, is a species of flowering plant in the family Rosaceae. It is native to the southeastern United States, particularly found in Florida and Georgia. The plant is a shrub that produces small, edible berries, though they are generally less flavorful compared to other blackberry varieties. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with a serrated edge, and it has thorny stems typical of the Rubus genus. The plant thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands or along stream banks."
