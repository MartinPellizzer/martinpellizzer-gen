    "intro": "Rubus moravicus, commonly known as the Moravian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that typically ripen to a dark purple or black color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers well-drained, loamy soils. The botanical features of Rubus moravicus make it an important species in both ecological and horticultural contexts."
