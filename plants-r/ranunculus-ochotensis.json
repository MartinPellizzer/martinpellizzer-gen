    "intro": "Ranunculus ochotensis, commonly known as the Ochotensis buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of Eurasia. It is a perennial herb characterized by its hairy stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces showy yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in moist, rocky soils and is often found in tundra and alpine environments. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
