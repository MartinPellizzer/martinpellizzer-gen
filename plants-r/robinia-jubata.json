    "intro": "Robinia jubata, commonly known as the white acacia, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to South Africa. It is characterized by its compound leaves that are pinnately arranged and have a feathery appearance. The plant produces yellow flowers in clusters, which bloom in early spring and attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its root system is deep and drought-resistant, making it well adapted to arid environments. The wood of Robinia jubata is strong and durable, historically used for construction and furniture."
