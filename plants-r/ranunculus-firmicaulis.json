    "intro": "Ranunculus firmicaulis, commonly known as the firm-stemmed buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features upright, hairy stems that support its delicate, palmately lobed leaves, which are typically green with a slightly hairy texture. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five petals and numerous stamens, typical of the Ranunculaceae family. It thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes. Due to its ornamental value and ecological significance, it is sometimes cultivated in gardens and conservation areas."
