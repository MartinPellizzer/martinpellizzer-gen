    "intro": "Roegneria brachypodioides, commonly known as the narrowleaf wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the mountainous regions of central and eastern Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, grass-like leaves that are typically less than 2 millimeters wide. The plant produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences with pale green to brownish flowers, which are wind-pollinated. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine and subalpine environments. Roegneria brachypodioides is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and fine-textured foliage."
