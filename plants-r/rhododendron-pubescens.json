    "intro": "Rhododendron pubescens, commonly known as the downy rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Asia, including China, Nepal, and Bhutan. It is characterized by its dense, hairy foliage that gives it a soft, downy appearance. The plant produces clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that range in color from pink to red, typically blooming in late spring. Its leaves are leathery and evergreen, providing year-round visual interest. Rhododendron pubescens thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in forested areas at high elevations."
