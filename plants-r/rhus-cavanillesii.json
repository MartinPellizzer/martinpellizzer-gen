    "intro": "Rhus cavanillesii, commonly known as the Mexican sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically 5 to 11 leaflets, and its clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers that bloom in the spring. The plant produces red, fleshy berries that are an important food source for wildlife. It thrives in well-drained soils and is drought-tolerant, making it suitable for xeriscaping. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its seasonal color changes and ability to provide habitat for birds and insects."
