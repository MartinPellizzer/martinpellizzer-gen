    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. scaldianus, commonly known as the Scottish buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the British Isles. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming from April to June. The plant has a basal rosette of leaves that are palmately lobed and covered in fine hairs. It thrives in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in meadows, woodland edges, and stream banks. Due to habitat loss, it is considered a rare and protected species in many regions."
