    "intro": "Rhamnus acuminata, commonly known as the prickly ash, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, gray bark and small, elliptical leaves that turn yellow in the fall. The plant produces clusters of small, yellowish-green flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for some wildlife. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks. Rhamnus acuminata is also valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in traditional medicine."
