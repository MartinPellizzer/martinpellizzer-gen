    "intro": "Rhamnus cornifolia, commonly known as the cornified buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its smooth, grayish-brown bark and opposite, simple leaves that are elliptical to ovate in shape. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers in clusters during the spring, followed by black, berry-like fruits in the fall. Its leaves and fruits are often used in traditional herbal medicine for their astringent properties. Rhamnus cornifolia thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and stream banks."
