    "intro": "Rosa canina var. evanida, commonly known as the Evan's dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinctive floral and foliage features. It is a deciduous shrub native to parts of Europe, particularly the British Isles, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces fragrant, pinkish-white flowers in early summer, followed by bright red, velvety hips that persist into autumn. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets that provide a dense, bushy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and historical significance."
