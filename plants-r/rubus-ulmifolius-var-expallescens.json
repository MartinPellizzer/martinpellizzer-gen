    "intro": "Rubus ulmifolius var. expallescens, commonly known as the silverleaf blackberry, is a variant of the common blackberry characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves. It is a perennial shrub native to Europe and parts of western Asia, typically found in woodland edges and rocky soils. The plant produces small, dark red to black berries that are edible but often tart in flavor. Its foliage is notable for the dense, woolly hairs that give it a soft, fuzzy appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is sometimes cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal."
