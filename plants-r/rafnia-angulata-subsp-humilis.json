    "intro": "Rafnia angulata subsp. humilis, commonly known as the narrow-leafed sycamore, is a small tree or shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its slender, angular leaves that are typically arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by winged fruits, which are dispersed by wind. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies in tropical regions."
