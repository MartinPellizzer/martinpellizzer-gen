    "intro": "Ranunculus baudotii var. fluitans, commonly known as the floating buttercup, is a aquatic plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers and heart-shaped leaves that float on the water surface. The plant typically grows in still or slow-moving freshwater habitats such as ponds and lakes. Its leaves are usually submerged or floating, while the flowers emerge above the water. It plays a role in aquatic ecosystems by providing habitat for small aquatic organisms."
