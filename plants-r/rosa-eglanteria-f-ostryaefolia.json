It is characterized by its distinctive silvery-white undersides on its leaves, which give it its common name. The plant produces fragrant pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia and thrives in well-drained soil and full sun. Due to its rarity and horticultural interest, it is often cultivated in specialized gardens."
