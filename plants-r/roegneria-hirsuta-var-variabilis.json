    "intro": "Roegneria hirsuta var. variabilis, commonly known as the variable hairy false brome, is a grass species native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and hairy leaf blades, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in moist, often calcareous soils and is found in meadows, pastures, and woodland edges. Its inflorescence consists of a dense, spike-like cluster of small, two-lipped flowers. This variety is noted for its variability in leaf and flower morphology, contributing to its classification as a variant."
