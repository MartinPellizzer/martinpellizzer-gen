    "intro": "Rudbeckia terranigrae, commonly known as the black earth coneflower, is a striking perennial plant native to the prairies of North America. It is characterized by its dark, almost black, foliage and vibrant yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer. The plant produces tubular ray flowers surrounded by a dense, conical disk of smaller florets. Rudbeckia terranigrae thrives in well-drained soils and full sun, making it a popular choice for native plant gardens. Its unique coloration and ecological benefits make it a valuable addition to pollinator-friendly landscapes."
