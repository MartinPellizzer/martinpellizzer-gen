    "intro": "Rumex acetosa var. atlantis, commonly known as the Atlantic sorrel, is a variant of the common sorrel native to coastal regions of Europe and North America. It is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy texture. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in dense clusters, which bloom in early summer. It thrives in moist, sandy soils and is often found in coastal dunes and salt marshes. This variant is notable for its adaptability to saline environments and its historical use in traditional medicine."
