It is characterized by its upright growth habit and thorny stems, which distinguish it from other Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are typically red when ripe. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have serrated margins, contributing to its ornamental value. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils."
