    "intro": "Reissantia parvifolia var. kageraensis, commonly known as the Kagera rock fig, is a shrub native to the rocky habitats of East Africa. It is characterized by its small, leathery leaves that are typically clustered at the base of the plant. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers that are clustered in inflorescences, followed by edible fig-like fruits. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to arid or semi-arid conditions. Due to its unique morphology and habitat, it is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
