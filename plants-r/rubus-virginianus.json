It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that develop from multiple small drupes. The plant typically grows in woodland edges, thickets, and disturbed soils, thriving in partial to full sunlight. Its flowers are white or pale pink, and the berries ripen to a deep black or purple color. The plant is valued for its edible fruits and plays a role in supporting local wildlife and ecosystems."
