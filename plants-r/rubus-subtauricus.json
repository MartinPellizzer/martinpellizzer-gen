    "intro": "Rubus subtauricus, commonly known as the alpine blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, dark berries that are often used in local cuisines and traditional medicine. It thrives in rocky, well-drained soils at high altitudes. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species in its native habitats."
