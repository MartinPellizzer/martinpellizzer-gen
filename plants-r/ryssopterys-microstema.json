    "intro": "Ryssopterys microstema, commonly known as the small-stemmed rock fern, is a rare and delicate fern species native to specific regions of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and finely divided, lance-shaped fronds that are often covered in a soft, velvety texture. The plant thrives in shaded, moist environments, typically found in rocky crevices or forest floors with high humidity. Its reproductive structures, including small, spore-producing sporangia, are clustered on the underside of its leaves. Due to its limited distribution and sensitivity to environmental changes, Ryssopterys microstema is considered a conservation concern in its native habitat."
