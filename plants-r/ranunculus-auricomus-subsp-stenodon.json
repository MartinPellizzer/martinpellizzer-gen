    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. stenodon, commonly known as the narrow-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petals that are typically smaller than those of the main species. The plant has palmately divided leaves that are usually more narrow and serrated compared to other ranunculus species. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows, streambanks, and woodland edges. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ornamental addition to gardens and natural habitats."
