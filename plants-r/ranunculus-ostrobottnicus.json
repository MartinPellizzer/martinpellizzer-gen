    "intro": "Ranunculus ostrobottnicus, commonly known as the Baltic buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the colder regions of Europe and western Siberia. It is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five petals and a hairy, lobed leaf structure. The plant typically grows in moist, calcareous soils and is often found in wet meadows and riverbanks. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, which includes many other flowering plants with showy blooms. Due to its habitat preferences, it is considered a rare and endangered species in some areas."
