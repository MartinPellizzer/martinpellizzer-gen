    "intro": "Rubus russeus, commonly known as the common blackberry shrub, is a deciduous shrub belonging to the Rosaceae family. It is native to Europe and parts of Asia, often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. The plant produces aggregate fruits, which are typically dark purple to black when mature, and are edible after the seeds have been removed. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the stems are covered in prickly bracts. Rubus russeus is valued for its ornamental appeal and historical use in both culinary and medicinal applications."
