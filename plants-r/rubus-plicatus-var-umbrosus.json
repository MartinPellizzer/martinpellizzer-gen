    "intro": "Rubus plicatus var. umbrosus, commonly known as the shaded raspberry, is a variant of the common raspberry that thrives in shaded environments. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and broad, trifoliate leaves that are often dark green in color. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or orange when mature. It is native to parts of Asia and is often found in forest understories where light is limited. Due to its adaptability to low-light conditions, it is a valuable plant for ecological studies and conservation efforts."
