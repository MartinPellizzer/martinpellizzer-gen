    "intro": "Ruppia maritima var. recta, commonly known as the straight sea rocket, is a halophytic plant adapted to saline environments. It typically grows in shallow coastal waters and brackish marshes, where it forms dense underwater vegetation. The plant has slender, branching stems with small, scale-like leaves that reduce water loss in its salty habitat. Its flowers are tiny and inconspicuous, arranged in spike-like clusters, and it relies on wind pollination. This variety is important for stabilizing sediments and providing habitat for aquatic organisms."
