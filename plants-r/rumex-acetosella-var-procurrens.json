It features small, arrow-shaped leaves with a distinctive reddish or purple coloration on the underside, and it produces clusters of tiny, greenish-white flowers in spring. The plant is characterized by its prostrate growth habit, with stems that often spread along the ground. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in woodland edges, wet meadows, and disturbed areas. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
