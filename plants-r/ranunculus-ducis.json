    "intro": "Ranunculus ducis, commonly known as the Ducis buttercup, is a species of flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, cup-shaped flowers that typically range in color from yellow to orange. The plant features a basal rosette of hairy, lance-shaped leaves and produces small, greenish sepals that enclose the flower buds. Ranunculus ducis thrives in cool, moist environments and is often found in alpine meadows. Its botanical significance lies in its role as a representative of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and ecological importance in high-altitude ecosystems."
