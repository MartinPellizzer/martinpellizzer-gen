    "intro": "Ranunculus demissus, commonly known as the lesser celandine, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features a fibrous root system and produces basal leaves that are broadly heart-shaped with a waxy surface. The plant blooms in early spring with clusters of bright yellow flowers that have 5 to 8 sepals and no true petals. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and streambanks. Ranunculus demissus is often considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid spread and ability to outcompete native flora."
