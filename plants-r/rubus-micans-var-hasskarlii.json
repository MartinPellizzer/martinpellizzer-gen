    "intro": "Rubus micans var. hasskarlii, commonly known as the silverleaf bramble, is a variant of the common blackberry species native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its silvery undersides on its leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, dark red berries that are typically less showy than those of other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. This variant is valued for its ornamental qualities and its role in local ecosystems."
