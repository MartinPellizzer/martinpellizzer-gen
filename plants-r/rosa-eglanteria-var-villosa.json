    "intro": "Rosa eglanteria var. villosa, commonly known as the downy shrub rose, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, which are covered in a dense layer of fine, white hairs, giving it a fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, pale yellow to orange flowers in late spring to early summer. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature. The downy shrub rose is also valued for its use in hedgerows and as a wildlife plant, providing shelter and nectar for pollinators."
