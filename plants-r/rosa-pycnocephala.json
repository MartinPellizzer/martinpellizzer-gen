    "intro": "Rosa pycnocephala, commonly known as the dense-headed rose, is a species of shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and dense, rounded clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant produces pink to red flowers that bloom in late summer, and its foliage is typically covered in fine, soft hairs. Rosa pycnocephala is well adapted to arid and semi-arid environments, with a deep root system that allows it to thrive in poor soils. It is valued both for its ornamental qualities and its role in traditional medicine in some regions."
