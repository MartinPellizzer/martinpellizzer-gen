    "intro": "Restrepia devolvens, commonly known as the hanging orchid, is a terrestrial orchid native to the Andean regions of South America. It is characterized by its delicate, pendulous inflorescences that bear clusters of small, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often on the forest floor or along stream banks. Its leaves are elongated and grass-like, forming a rosette structure that helps it retain moisture. The species is prized by orchid enthusiasts for its unique appearance and ease of cultivation under the right conditions."
