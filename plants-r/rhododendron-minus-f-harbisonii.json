    "intro": "Rhododendron minus f. harbisonii, commonly known as the Harbison's dwarf rhododendron, is a compact, evergreen shrub native to the eastern United States. It features dense, leathery leaves that are typically dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers are usually pink to red in color, appearing in early spring before the leaves fully emerge. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and hardiness, thriving in acidic, well-drained soils. It is often used in rock gardens or as a foundation plant due to its low-growing habit and ability to tolerate partial shade."
