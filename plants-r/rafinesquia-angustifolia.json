It is characterized by its tall, erect stems and clusters of yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant has narrow, linear leaves and is often found in rocky or sandy soils. It is a member of the Fabaceae family, which includes legumes, and has a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Rafinesquia angustifolia is adapted to arid environments and is often used in xeriscaping due to its drought tolerance."
