    "intro": "Rubus inanis, commonly known as the slender blackberry, is a species of bramble native to North America. It is characterized by its slender, arching stems and small, white flowers that bloom in early summer. The plant produces small, edible berries that are typically black when mature, though they are often less flavorful compared to other blackberry species. It thrives in moist, wooded areas and is often found in the understory of forests. Due to its delicate structure and limited distribution, it is considered a rare and sometimes endangered plant."
