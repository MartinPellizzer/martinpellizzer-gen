    "intro": "Rosa villosa var. subglobosa, commonly known as the woolly rose or subglobose rose, is a compact, shrubby species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence covering the stems and leaves, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, pink to red flowers in late spring to early summer. It thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a hardy addition to gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its compact growth habit and prolonged blooming period."
