    "intro": "Rosa curticola, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and thorny stems, which provide it with a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are narrow and covered in a fine layer of white hairs, which help reduce water loss in arid environments. Rosa curticola is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in cooler climates."
