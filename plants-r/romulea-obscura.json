It belongs to the Iridaceae family, which includes irises and related flowering plants. The plant produces striking, violet-blue flowers with a distinctive, spurred petal that resembles a bee. Its bulbs are underground storage organs that allow it to survive in dry conditions. Romulea obscura is often found in rocky, well-drained soils in mountainous regions."
