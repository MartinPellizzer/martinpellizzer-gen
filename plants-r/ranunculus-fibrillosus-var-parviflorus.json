    "intro": "Ranunculus fibrillosus var. parviflorus, commonly known as the small-flowered water crowfoot, is a delicate aquatic plant native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow freshwater habitats such as ponds, streams, and marshes. The plant has finely divided, floating leaves that are often covered in a waxy layer to reduce water loss. Its small, yellow flowers bloom in early spring, producing a cluster of stamens that surround a central pistil. This variety is characterized by its compact size and is often found in association with other aquatic flora in still or slow-moving water bodies."
