    "intro": "Rubus koehleri var. infestus, commonly known as the invasive bramble, is a variant of the Rubus genus native to parts of Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that mature to a dark red or black color. This plant thrives in disturbed soils and can form dense thickets, often outcompeting native vegetation. Its rapid growth and spreading habit make it a significant weed in agricultural and natural areas. Botanically, it is distinguished by its morphological traits and genetic variation from the parent species."
