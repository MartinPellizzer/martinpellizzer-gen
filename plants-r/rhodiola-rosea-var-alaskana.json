    "intro": "Rhodiola rosea var. alaskana, commonly known as the Alaska rose root, is a perennial herb native to the Arctic and subarctic regions of North America. It thrives in cold, high-altitude environments and is characterized by its fleshy, reddish roots and clusters of small, white or pink flowers. The plant is adapted to harsh conditions, with a deep root system that helps it survive in permafrost and rocky soils. Its leaves are typically narrow and evergreen, and it is often found in tundra and alpine meadows. This variety is closely related to other rhodiola species and is valued for its traditional medicinal uses."
