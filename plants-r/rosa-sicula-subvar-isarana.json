    "intro": "Rosa sicula subvar. isarana, commonly known as the Isarana rose, is a rare and endemic subspecies native to southern Italy. It is characterized by its compact growth habit and fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically features thorny stems and dark green, serrated leaves. It thrives in well-drained soil and requires full sun for optimal growth. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
