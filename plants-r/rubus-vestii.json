    "intro": "Rubus vestii, commonly known as the Japanese blackberry, is a species of brambles native to East Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and aggregate fruits that are typically dark red to black in color. The plant produces small, white flowers in the spring, which are followed by the development of its edible berries. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its invasive potential, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
