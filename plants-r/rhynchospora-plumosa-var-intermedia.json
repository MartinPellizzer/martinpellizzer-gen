It is a perennial herb with slender, grass-like leaves that are covered in fine, silky hairs, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically arranged in spike-like clusters. It thrives in moist to wet soils and is often found in marshes, swamps, and along the edges of ponds. Due to its specific habitat requirements, it plays an important role in maintaining the ecological balance of wetland ecosystems."
