    "intro": "Rhus melanocarpa, commonly known as the prickly ash or smooth sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and turn bright red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in umbrella-like clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and wildlife. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in open woods, along streambanks, and in disturbed areas. The bark and leaves have been used traditionally for their medicinal properties."
