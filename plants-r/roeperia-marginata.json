    "intro": "Roeperia marginata, commonly known as the narrowleaf roeperia, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It typically grows in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in cool, moist environments. The plant features slender, upright stems with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often covered in a fine, silvery pubescence. Its flowers are small, yellowish-green, and clustered in loose panicles, adding a subtle ornamental appeal. Roeperia marginata is valued in horticulture for its hardiness and ability to thrive in challenging garden conditions."
