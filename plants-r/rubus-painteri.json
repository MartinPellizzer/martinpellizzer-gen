    "intro": "Rubus painteri, commonly known as the painter's raspberry, is a shrub native to the mountainous regions of western China. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its prickly stems and dense clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces small, red berries that are edible and have a tart flavor. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. Due to its rarity and specific habitat requirements, Rubus painteri is considered a conservation concern."
