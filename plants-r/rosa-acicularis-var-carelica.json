    "intro": "Rosa acicularis var. carelica, commonly known as the Carelica thornapple, is a variant of the thorny rose native to the Arctic regions of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its dense, thorny stems and small, clustered flowers that range from white to pink in color. The plant produces small, round berries that are typically red when mature, and it thrives in cold, harsh environments. It is often found growing in rocky or coastal areas where it can withstand strong winds and low temperatures. Its botanical features make it an important species for studying plant adaptation to extreme climates."
