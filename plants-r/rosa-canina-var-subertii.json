    "intro": "Rosa canina var. subertii, commonly known as the suberous dogwood rose, is a less commonly cultivated variant of the common rose. It is characterized by its dense, suberous (bark-like) stems and smaller, more compact growth habit compared to typical Rosa canina. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, followed by red-orange hips that are edible and rich in vitamin C. It is often found in woodland edges and rocky soils, thriving in temperate climates. Due to its unique morphology and ornamental value, it is occasionally grown in specialized gardens and conservation efforts."
