    "intro": "Rodriguezia crispa, commonly known as the crinkled Rodriguezia, is a striking tropical plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its broad, waxy leaves that have a distinctive crinkled or ruffled appearance. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink and white, which bloom during the warmer months. Its unique foliage makes it a popular choice for ornamental gardening. However, it requires bright, indirect light and well-draining soil to thrive."
