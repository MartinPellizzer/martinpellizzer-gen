    "intro": "Rubus triflorus f. multipetalus, commonly known as the showy blackberry, is a variant of the blackberry plant characterized by its striking floral display. This form exhibits larger, more showy flowers with multiple petals, which distinguish it from the typical blackberry species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of the Rubus genus. It produces edible berries that are similar to common blackberries but may have a slightly different flavor profile. This botanical feature makes it a notable ornamental and potentially cultivable plant in gardens."
