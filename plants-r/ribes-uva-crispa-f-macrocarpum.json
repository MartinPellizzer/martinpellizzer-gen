    "intro": "Ribes uva-crispa f. macrocarpum, commonly known as the large-fruited gooseberry, is a cultivated form of the common gooseberry. It is characterized by its notably larger, more elongated berries compared to the typical species. The plant is a deciduous shrub with alternate, simple, and often serrated leaves. It produces clusters of yellowish-green flowers in early spring, which are followed by the showy, red to orange berries in late summer. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and is often grown in gardens for both its foliage and fruit."
