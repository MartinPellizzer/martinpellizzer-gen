    "intro": "Restio filiformis var. oligostachyus, commonly known as the slender restio, is a flowering plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its narrow, grass-like leaves and tall, slender stems that often grow in dense clusters. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, white or pale green flowers. It typically thrives in wet, sandy soils along coastal areas and estuaries. Due to its delicate appearance and specific habitat requirements, it is often found in coastal vegetation and is of interest to botanists and conservationists."
