    "intro": "Rosa pomifera f. recondita, commonly known as the wild rose or sea rose, is a rare and unique variant of the Rosa pomifera species. It is characterized by its large, edible, apple-like fruits that are typically found in coastal regions. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and dark green, ovate leaves. It produces fragrant pink to white flowers in the spring, which are followed by its distinctive, fleshy fruits. This botanical curiosity is valued for both its ecological role and its historical use in traditional medicine."
