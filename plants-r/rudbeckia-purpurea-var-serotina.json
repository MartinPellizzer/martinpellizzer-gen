    "intro": "Rudbeckia purpurea var. serotina, commonly known as late purple coneflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the eastern and central United States. It features upright, branching stems that can grow up to 2 to 3 meters tall, adorned with large, daisy-like yellow-orange flower heads that bloom in late summer to early autumn. The plant has palmate, heart-shaped leaves with serrated edges, and its root system consists of fibrous roots that help anchor it in moist to wet soils. It thrives in full sun to partial shade and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and other moist habitats. This species is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting pollinators such as bees and butterflies."
