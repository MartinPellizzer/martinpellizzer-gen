It is characterized by its basal rosette of hairy, spoon-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, white pubescence. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters during the summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges or rocky habitats. Its ornamental value comes from its distinctive foliage and delicate floral display."
