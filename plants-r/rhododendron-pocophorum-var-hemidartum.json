    "intro": "Rhododendron pocophorum var. hemidartum, commonly known as the dwarf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of Southeast Asia. It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, often with a slight pubescence. The plant produces clusters of small, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and prefers partial shade to full sun, making it suitable for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its neat growth habit and long-lasting blooms."
