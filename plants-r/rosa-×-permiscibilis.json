    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 permiscibilis, commonly known as the everblooming rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the crossbreeding of Rosa rugosa and Rosa \u00d7 centifolia. It is characterized by its ability to produce flowers continuously throughout the growing season, making it a popular choice for gardeners seeking long-lasting blooms. The plant typically features robust, thorned stems and dark green, serrated leaves. Its flowers are usually pink or red, with a strong, sweet fragrance. Rosa \u00d7 permiscibilis is well-suited for coastal gardens due to its tolerance of salty air and poor soil conditions."
