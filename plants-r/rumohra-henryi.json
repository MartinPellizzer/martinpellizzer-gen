    "intro": "Rumohra henryi, commonly known as the Henry's fern, is a species of aquatic fern native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its delicate, floating fronds that are typically less than 10 cm in length. The plant thrives in slow-moving freshwater environments, such as ponds and streams. Its rhizomes form dense mats that help stabilize sediment and provide habitat for aquatic organisms. The spore-producing structures, called sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of the Polypodiaceae family."
