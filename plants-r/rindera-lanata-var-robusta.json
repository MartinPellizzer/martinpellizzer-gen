    "intro": "Rindera lanata var. robusta, commonly known as the woolly rindera, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to arid and semi-arid regions. It is characterized by its dense, woolly covering of hairs on its stems and leaves, which helps reduce water loss in dry environments. The plant typically grows to a height of 30\u201360 cm, with narrow, lance-shaped leaves that are often grayish-green in color. Its flowers are small and clustered, usually in shades of yellow or green, and bloom during the warmer months. This variety is well adapted to harsh conditions and is often found in rocky or sandy soils."
