It features bright yellow ray flowers surrounding a dark brown central disk, which gives it its common name. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 feet and produces showy blooms from late summer into early fall. Its leaves are lance-shaped and covered in fine hairs, and it thrives in full sun to partial shade. Rudbeckia flava is a hardy plant that is well-suited for garden landscapes and attracts pollinators like bees and butterflies."
