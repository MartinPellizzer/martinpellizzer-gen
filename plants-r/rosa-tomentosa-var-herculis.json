    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. herculis, commonly known as the Hercules rose, is a shrub-like plant native to the Mediterranean region. It is characterized by its dense, woolly foliage and clusters of fragrant, pale yellow to orange flowers. The plant typically grows to a height of 1 to 2 meters and has thorny stems, which are a common feature in many rose species. Its leaves are compound, with multiple small, oval-shaped leaflets, and it produces rose hips that are often used in herbal remedies. This variety is well-suited to full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy and ornamental plant in gardens."
