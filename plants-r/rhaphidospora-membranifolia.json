    "intro": "Rhaphidospora membranifolia, commonly known as the membranous fern, is a species of aquatic fern belonging to the family Polypodiaceae. It is characterized by its delicate, membranous fronds that are typically broad and lance-shaped. The plant thrives in freshwater environments, such as ponds and slow-moving streams, where it attaches to submerged surfaces. Its reproductive structures, including sori, are located on the underside of the fronds, typical of many ferns. The plant's structure and growth habits make it an important component of aquatic ecosystems."
