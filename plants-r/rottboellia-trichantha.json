    "intro": "Rottboellia trichantha, commonly known as the common panicgrass, is a perennial grass species native to tropical and subtropical regions. It features slender, erect stems with narrow, grass-like leaves that are typically hairy along the edges. The plant produces small, inconspicuous spikelets that are arranged in dense clusters along the stem. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. Rottboellia trichantha is characterized by its rapid growth and ability to form dense stands, making it both a weed and a forage plant in some regions."
