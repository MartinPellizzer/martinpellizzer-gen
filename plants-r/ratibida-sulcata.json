    "intro": "Ratibida sulcata, commonly known as the rough coneflower, is a flowering plant native to the central and eastern United States. It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads and robust, hairy stems. The plant features showy yellow-orange ray florets surrounding a central disk of tubular flowers, which attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soil, making it a hardy perennial suitable for native gardens. The rough texture of its leaves and stems gives it its common name, and it is often found in prairies and open woodlands."
