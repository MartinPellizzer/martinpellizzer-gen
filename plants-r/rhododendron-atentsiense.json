    "intro": "Rhododendron atentsiense, commonly known as the Atentsi rhododendron, is a species native to the mountainous regions of eastern Tibet and northern Sichuan in China. It is a deciduous shrub that typically grows at high altitudes, often in rocky or forested areas. The plant features broad, leathery leaves and produces clusters of showy, pinkish-red flowers in the spring. It belongs to the Ericaceae family, which includes many other ornamental and ecologically significant plants. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and potentially endangered species."
