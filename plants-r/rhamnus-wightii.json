    "intro": "Rhamnus wightii, commonly known as Wight's buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the arid regions of the Middle East and Central Asia. It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine hairs. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds and small mammals. Its root system is deep and drought-tolerant, allowing it to thrive in sandy or rocky soils. Rhamnus wightii is also valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes cultivated in gardens in dry climates."
