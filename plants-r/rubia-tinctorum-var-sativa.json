    "intro": "Rubia tinctorum var. sativa, commonly known as common madder, is a flowering plant native to Europe, western Asia, and north Africa. It is characterized by its erect, herbaceous stems and palmate leaves with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, pale yellow flowers in clusters, and its roots contain a deep red pigment called rubia, which has been historically used for dyeing textiles. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in disturbed areas such as roadsides and fields. This species is also valued in traditional medicine for its potential health benefits."
