    "intro": "Rubus provostii, commonly known as the Pacific blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the western United States and parts of Canada. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that are typically trifoliate. The plant produces small, white to pale pink flowers that bloom in early summer, followed by edible blackberries that are highly sought after for their flavor and texture. Botanically, it belongs to the Rosaceae family and is closely related to other Rubus species. Its berries are rich in antioxidants and have been used in both culinary and traditional medicinal applications."
