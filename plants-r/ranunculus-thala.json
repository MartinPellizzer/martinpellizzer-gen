    "intro": "Ranunculus thala, commonly known as the sea buttercup, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Mediterranean. It is characterized by its bright yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals and numerous stamens. The plant thrives in sandy or rocky soils and is often found in tidal zones. Its leaves are typically lobed and adapted to withstand salt spray and strong winds. Ranunculus thala plays a role in stabilizing coastal dunes and providing habitat for small invertebrates."
