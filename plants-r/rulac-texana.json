    "intro": "Rulac texana, commonly known as the Texas rulac, is a rare flowering plant native to the arid regions of Texas. It belongs to the family Fabaceae, which includes legumes, and is characterized by its small, pea-like flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky soils and has adapted to withstand drought conditions. Its leaves are trifoliate, meaning they consist of three leaflets, and it produces pod-like fruits that contain seeds. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Rulac texana is considered a vulnerable species."
