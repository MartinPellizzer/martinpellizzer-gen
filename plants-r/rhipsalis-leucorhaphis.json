    "intro": "Rhipsalis leucorhaphis, commonly known as the white-flowered mistletoe cactus, is a climbing cactus native to Brazil. It features long, slender stems that can trail or climb, often covered in small, white or pale green spines. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in winter, followed by red, fleshy fruits. It thrives in bright, indirect light and requires well-draining soil to prevent root rot. Its unique appearance and seasonal flowering make it a popular choice for indoor gardening."
