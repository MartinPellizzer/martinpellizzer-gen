    "intro": "Renia, commonly known as the flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the family Gesneriaceae. These plants are characterized by their vibrant, showy flowers that often display striking red, orange, or yellow hues. Renia species are typically shrubs or trailing plants, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Their leaves are usually opposite and ovate, with a waxy surface that helps reduce water loss. The genus includes several species, such as Renia splendens, which is popular among horticulturists for its ornamental value."
