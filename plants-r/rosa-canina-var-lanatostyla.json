    "intro": "Rosa canina var. lanatostyla, commonly known as the hairy rose or bristly rose, is a botanical variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its hairy stems and leaves, which distinguish it from the more commonly cultivated Rosa canina. This variety is native to southern Europe and western Asia, where it thrives in temperate climates. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that range in color from white to pink, followed by orange-red hips. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in horticulture and plant taxonomy."
