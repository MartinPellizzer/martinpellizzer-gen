    "intro": "Rosa canina var. recognita, commonly known as the recognized dog rose, is a variant of the common dog rose, characterized by its distinct floral and foliar features. It is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia, typically growing in woodland and scrub habitats. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers in early summer, followed by orange-red hips that are rich in vitamin C. Its leaves are pinnately compound, with serrated leaflets, and the stems are often armed with thorns. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and historical use in herbal medicine."
