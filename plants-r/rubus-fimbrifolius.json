    "intro": "Rubus fimbrifolius, commonly known as the fringe-leaved blackberry, is a species of bramble native to eastern North America. It is characterized by its shrub-like growth habit, with thorny stems and compound leaves that have a serrated, fringed edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black when ripe. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained habitats. Botanically, it is closely related to other Rubus species and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks."
