    "intro": "Rumex acetosella var. australis, commonly known as the Australian sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to Australia. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and heart-shaped leaves that are often reddish in color. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, acidic soils and is often found in wetlands and along stream banks. This variety is closely related to the common sorrel, but it has adapted to the specific environmental conditions of its native habitat."
