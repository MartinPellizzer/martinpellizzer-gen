    "intro": "Ranunculus hederaceus subsp. omiophyllus, commonly known as the creeping buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features a low-growing, spreading habit with glossy, heart-shaped leaves that form dense mats. The plant produces small, yellow flowers with five petals, typically blooming in early spring. It thrives in moist, shady environments and is often found in woodlands and along streambanks. Its rapid growth and ability to colonize disturbed areas make it both a common weed and an ecologically significant species."
