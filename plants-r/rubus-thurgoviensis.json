    "intro": "Rubus thurgoviensis, commonly known as the Thurgovian blackberry, is a species of bramble native to Central Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark berries that are typically harvested in late summer. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white to pink flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and hedgerows. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and locally significant species in its native range."
