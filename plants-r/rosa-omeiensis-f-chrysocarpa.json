    "intro": "Rosa omeiensis f. chrysocarpa, commonly known as the golden-fruited rose, is a unique hybrid rose species originating from China. It is characterized by its striking yellow-orange hips, which are larger and more vibrant than those of the typical Rosa omeiensis. The plant produces fragrant pink to white flowers with five to seven petals, typical of many rose species. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is relatively hardy, thriving in well-drained soil and full sun. This cultivar is prized for its ornamental fruits and floral display, making it a popular choice in gardens and botanical collections."
