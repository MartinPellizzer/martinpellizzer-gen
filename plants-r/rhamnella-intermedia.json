    "intro": "Rhamnella intermedia, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to eastern North America. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its small, oval leaves and clusters of yellowish-green flowers. The plant produces small, dark blue berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It is often found in moist woodlands and along stream banks, where it thrives in partial shade. Due to its invasive tendencies, it is sometimes considered a weed in certain regions."
