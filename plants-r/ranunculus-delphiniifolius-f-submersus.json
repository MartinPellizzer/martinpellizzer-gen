    "intro": "Ranunculus delphiniifolius f. submersus, commonly known as the submerged water crowfoot, is a rare aquatic variant of the water crowfoot genus. It is characterized by its finely divided, submerged leaves that are adapted for life in freshwater environments. The plant typically grows in slow-moving or still waters, such as ponds and lakes, where it can anchor itself to substrates. Its flowers, though less prominent than in terrestrial forms, are usually small and yellow, emerging from the water surface. This subspecies is of interest to botanists due to its unique adaptations to aquatic habitats."
