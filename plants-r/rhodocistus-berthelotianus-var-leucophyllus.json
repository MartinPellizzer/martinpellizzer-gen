    "intro": "Rhodocistus berthelotianus var. leucophyllus, commonly known as the white-leafed rhodocistus, is a rare and striking plant native to the mountainous regions of southern Africa. It is characterized by its broad, white to pale green leaves that contrast with its deep red or purple stems. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that range in color from pink to deep red, typically blooming in late spring. It thrives in well-drained, sandy soils and requires full sun to partial shade. Due to its rarity and unique appearance, it is often cultivated in botanical gardens and by plant enthusiasts."
