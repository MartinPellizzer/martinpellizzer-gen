    "intro": "Rafnia ovata, commonly known as the oval-leaf sycamore, is a species of flowering plant in the family Moraceae. It is native to tropical regions of Africa and is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are typically smooth and glossy. The plant produces small, clustered flowers that are either male or female, and it is often found growing along riverbanks and in moist, shady habitats. Rafnia ovata is valued for its hard, durable wood, which has been used historically in construction and tool-making. Its ecological role includes providing habitat and food for various insects and birds."
