    "intro": "Rosa malyi f. megalophylla, commonly known as the giant leaf rock rose, is a unique horticultural form of the species Rosa malyi. It is characterized by its large, showy leaves that are significantly larger than those of the typical species, often reaching several inches in length. The plant produces clusters of fragrant, semi-double pink flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. It is a deciduous shrub that thrives in well-drained soil and full sun, making it a popular choice for rock gardens and xeriscaping. Its botanical interest lies in its distinctive foliage and its role as a cultivar that showcases the genetic diversity within the Rosa genus."
