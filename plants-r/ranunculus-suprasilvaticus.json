    "intro": "Ranunculus suprasilvaticus, commonly known as the alpine buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It typically grows in high-altitude environments, such as alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. The plant features bright yellow flowers with five to seven petals, and its leaves are palmately divided with a distinctive hairy texture. It is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap. Due to its limited habitat, it is considered a rare and protected species in many areas."
