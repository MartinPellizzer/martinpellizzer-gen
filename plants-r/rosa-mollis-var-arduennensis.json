    "intro": "Rosa mollis var. arduennensis, commonly known as the Arduennian soft rose, is a rare and delicate species native to the mountainous regions of central Europe. It is characterized by its soft, fuzzy foliage and pale pink to white flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist woodland areas, preferring well-drained, loamy soils. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and it produces small, fragrant flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a conservation concern in its native range."
