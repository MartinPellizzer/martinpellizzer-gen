    "intro": "Rotala halophila, commonly known as salt marsh rotala, is a flowering plant native to coastal regions of the Americas. It is a herbaceous perennial that thrives in saline and brackish water environments. The plant has small, opposite leaves that are often submerged or floating, adapting to its aquatic habitat. Its flowers are typically clustered in dense inflorescences and are pollinated by insects. Rotala halophila plays an important role in stabilizing shorelines and providing habitat for aquatic life."
