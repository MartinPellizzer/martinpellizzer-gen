    "intro": "Roegneria tuskaulensis, commonly known as Tuskaul's wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the central and northern regions of the United States. It is characterized by its tufted growth habit and slender, wiry stems that often form dense clumps. The plant produces spikelets that are typically pale green to blue-green in color, with lemmas that are often pubescent. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open habitats such as prairies and disturbed areas. Roegneria tuskaulensis is valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in stabilizing soil in ecological restoration projects."
