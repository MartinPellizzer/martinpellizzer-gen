    "intro": "Rhynchosia nervosa var. pauciflora, commonly known as the sparse-flowered snout bean, is a tropical leguminous plant characterized by its slender, climbing stems and trifoliate leaves. It produces small, yellowish flowers arranged in clusters, which are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits containing several seeds. The plant is native to regions of South America and is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and open forests. Its botanical features make it a subject of interest in ecological and horticultural studies. The variety pauciflora is distinguished by its reduced number of flowers compared to the typical species."
