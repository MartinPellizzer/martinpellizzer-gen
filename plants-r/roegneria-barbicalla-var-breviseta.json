    "intro": "Roegneria barbicalla var. breviseta, commonly known as the narrow-leaved wheatgrass, is a perennial grass species native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, grass-like foliage and compact growth habit, often forming dense mats on rocky or sandy soils. The plant produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear minute, wind-pollinated flowers. Its leaves are typically narrow and have a bluish-green hue, with a distinctive waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. This variety is well adapted to arid environments and is often used in restoration projects due to its ecological resilience."
