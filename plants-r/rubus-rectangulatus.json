    "intro": "Rubus rectangulatus, commonly known as the narrow-leaf blackberry, is a species of bramble native to western North America. It is characterized by its slender, thorny stems and trifoliate leaves with sharply toothed margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically dark purple to black in color. It thrives in a variety of habitats, including woodlands and disturbed soils, and is often found in the Pacific Northwest. Due to its hardy nature, it is a common weed in agricultural and natural areas."
