    "intro": "Rubus myriadenus var. grandifoliolatus, commonly known as the giant-leaf bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is characterized by its large, compound leaves that can reach up to 30 cm in length, with numerous leaflets arranged in a pinnate pattern. The plant produces small, white to pinkish flowers that bloom in summer, followed by red, hairy berries. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of North America and thrives in moist, shaded environments. Due to its vigorous growth and invasive potential, it is often considered a weed in natural areas."
