    "intro": "Ranunculus gregarius subsp. carpetanus, commonly known as the carpet buttercup, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its low-growing habit, with bright yellow flowers that have five to eight petals. The plant typically thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in alpine meadows and rocky habitats. Its subspecies status reflects its distinct morphological and ecological adaptations compared to the broader species. The carpet buttercup plays a role in local ecosystems by providing nectar for pollinators and contributing to soil stabilization."
