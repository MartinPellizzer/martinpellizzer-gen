It features upright stems covered in dense, thorny prickles, which provide protection against herbivores. The plant produces clusters of small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to white, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and have sharply pointed leaflets, contributing to its distinctive appearance. This variety is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its beauty and hardiness."
