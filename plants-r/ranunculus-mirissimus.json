    "intro": "Ranunculus mirissimus, commonly known as the sorrowful buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It features delicate, cup-shaped flowers with five to eight petals, typically in shades of yellow to orange, and is often adorned with a hairy stem. The plant has trifoliate leaves that are deeply lobed, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It blooms in late spring to early summer, adding a striking touch to alpine gardens. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species in many areas."
