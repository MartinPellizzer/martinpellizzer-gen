    "intro": "Rafflesia arnoldi var. atjehensis, commonly known as the Atjeh Rafflesia, is a member of the Rafflesia genus, known for its massive, fleshy\u82b1\u6735 that can reach up to 1 meter in diameter. It is a parasitic plant that lacks true leaves, stems, and roots, relying entirely on its host vine for nutrients. The plant produces a strong, unpleasant odor reminiscent of decaying flesh to attract pollinators such as flies and carrion beetles. It is native to the rainforests of Sumatra and is considered one of the rarest and most endangered plant species in the world. Its unique botanical features make it a subject of scientific interest and conservation efforts."
