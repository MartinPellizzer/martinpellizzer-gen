    "intro": "Restrepiopsis inaequalis, commonly known as the Andean bellflower, is a flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of South America. It belongs to the Campanulaceae family and is characterized by its bell-shaped, blue or purple flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or alpine environments, where it thrives in cool, moist conditions. Its leaves are usually narrow and grass-like, and it produces small, tubular flowers that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Due to its habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species in its native range."
