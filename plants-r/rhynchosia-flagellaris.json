It features compound leaves with three to five leaflets and produces small, yellow flowers that are followed by elongated, pod-like fruits. The plant is notable for its ability to fix nitrogen through symbiotic relationships with Rhizobium bacteria, making it valuable in agricultural systems. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often used as a forage crop or in traditional medicine. Its rapid growth and adaptability make it an important species in ecological and agricultural contexts."
