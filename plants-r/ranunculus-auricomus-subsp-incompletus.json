It belongs to the Ranunculaceae family and is characterized by its delicate, yellow flowers with five to seven petals. The subspecies is distinguished by its smaller, less lobed leaves compared to the typical form of Ranunculus auricomus. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and woodland edges. The plant is notable for its early spring blooming habit and its role in supporting pollinators."
