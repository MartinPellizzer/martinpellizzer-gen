    "intro": "Rubus leucophaeus f. intermedius, commonly known as the intermediate white-haired raspberry, is a botanical variant of the Rubus genus. It is characterized by its pale white to pale pink flowers and its intermediate traits between the typical Rubus leucophaeus and other related species. The plant is a shrub with thorny stems and compound leaves, typical of many Rubus species. It produces small, aggregate fruits known as drupes, which are often red or yellow when mature. This form is of interest to botanists due to its unique morphological characteristics and potential for hybridization."
