    "intro": "Ricinodendron rautanenii, commonly known as the African satinwood, is a tropical evergreen tree native to western and central Africa. It belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae and is characterized by its glossy, dark green leaves and smooth, light-colored bark. The tree produces small, greenish-yellow flowers followed by woody, capsule-like fruits containing flat, winged seeds. It is valued for its durable, heavy wood, which is used in furniture and construction. However, it is also considered a threatened species due to habitat loss and overexploitation."
