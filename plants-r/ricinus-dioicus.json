    "intro": "Ricinus dioicus, commonly known as the castor oil plant, is a flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is a dioecious species, meaning it has separate male and female plants. The plant is native to parts of Africa and is characterized by its large, palmate leaves and distinctive spiky seed capsules. The seeds, known as castor beans, contain a toxic oil called ricin, which has both industrial and medicinal applications. It thrives in warm climates and is often cultivated for its oil-producing potential."
