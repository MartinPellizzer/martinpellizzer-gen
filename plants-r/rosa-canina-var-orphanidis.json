    "intro": "Rosa canina var. orphanidis, commonly known as the Orphanis rose, is a rare and lesser-known variant of the dog rose. It is characterized by its pale pink to white flowers and thorned stems, typical of the Rosa canina species. The plant is native to parts of the Mediterranean region and thrives in well-drained, sunny soils. Its foliage consists of pinnately compound leaves with serrated edges, and it produces small, red-orange hips similar to its parent species. Due to its limited distribution and rarity, it is considered a botanical curiosity and is often found in isolated habitats."
