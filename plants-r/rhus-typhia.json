    "intro": "Rhus typhia, commonly known as staghorn sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to North America. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are bright green in summer and turn vibrant red in the fall. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for birds and other wildlife. Its bark is thick and rough, with a distinctive, rugged texture that gives it its common name. Rhus typhia is often found in moist, disturbed soils along streambanks and roadsides."
