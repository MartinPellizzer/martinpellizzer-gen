    "intro": "Rubus urticifolius typicus, commonly known as the stinging bramble, is a shrub native to southern Europe and parts of North Africa. It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves. The plant produces small, white to pink flowers in the spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in the summer. Its leaves contain irritants that can cause skin irritation, hence the common name. It thrives in a variety of soil types and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas."
