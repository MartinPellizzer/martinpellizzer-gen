    "intro": "Ricinocarpus californicus, commonly known as the California ricinocarp, is a rare and unique plant species native to specific regions of California. It is characterized by its distinctive, palm-like appearance with large, fan-shaped leaves that are often covered in fine, silky hairs. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers that are typically greenish-white in color. Its fruit is a spiny capsule that contains toxic seeds, which are a key feature of the genus Ricinocarpus. Due to its limited distribution and specific ecological requirements, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native habitat."
