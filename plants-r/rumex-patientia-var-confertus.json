    "intro": "Rumex patientia var. confertus, commonly known as the broad-leaved dock, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features basal leaves that are broad, heart-shaped, and often covered with fine hairs, giving them a rough texture. The plant produces tall, erect flowering stems topped with clusters of small, greenish-yellow flowers. It thrives in moist, nutrient-rich soils and is often found in wet meadows, marshes, and along riverbanks. Its leaves and flowers are used in traditional medicine and as a food source for certain wildlife."
