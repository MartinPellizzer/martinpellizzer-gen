    "intro": "Ranunculus auricomus subsp. pusillicans, commonly known as the small-flowered buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It features delicate, yellow flowers with five petal-like sepals, which are often mistaken for true petals. The plant typically grows in moist, shady habitats such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately divided, with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. It is a member of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic compounds."
