    "intro": "Rubus \u00d7 tawadanus, commonly known as the Tawadan blackberry, is a hybrid plant resulting from the cross between Rubus ursinus (the trailing blackberry) and Rubus pectoralis (the evergreen blackberry). It is native to the coastal regions of southern California, where it thrives in sandy, well-drained soils. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, dark green leaves, and clusters of small, dark purple to black berries. It is valued for its hardiness and ability to grow in coastal climates with minimal water requirements. Due to its unique genetic makeup, it exhibits traits that make it both resilient and adaptable to specific ecological conditions."
