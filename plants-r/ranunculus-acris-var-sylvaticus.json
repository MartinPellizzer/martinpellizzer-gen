It is characterized by its bright yellow, cup-shaped flowers with 5 to 15 petals, typically blooming in early spring. The plant has finely divided, trifoliate leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps reduce water loss. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and meadows. The species is part of the Ranunculaceae family, known for its showy flowers and often toxic sap."
