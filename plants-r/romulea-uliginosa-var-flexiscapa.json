    "intro": "Romulea uliginosa var. flexiscapa, commonly known as the bog romulea, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to southern Africa. It is characterized by its rosette of narrow, grass-like leaves and produces showy, yellow-orange flowers in late summer. The plant thrives in wet, acidic soils and is often found in marshy or boggy habitats. Its flowers are typically clustered in a spike and are adapted for pollination by insects. This variety is distinguished by its flexible, arching stems, which set it apart from other varieties of Romulea."
