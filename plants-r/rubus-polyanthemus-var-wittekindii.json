    "intro": "Rubus polyanthemus var. wittekindii, commonly known as the purple-leaf bramble, is a variant of the evergreen bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States. It is characterized by its dense, thorny growth habit and dark green, often purple-tinged foliage. The plant produces clusters of small, white flowers in early spring, which are followed by red, edible berries in late summer. Its leaves are typically oval with serrated edges and a leathery texture. This variety is valued for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in shaded, moist environments."
