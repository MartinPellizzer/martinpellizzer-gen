It is characterized by its dark green, leathery leaves and prickly stems, which are typical of the Rubus genus. The plant produces small, edible berries that are often used in local cuisines. It thrives in coastal climates with mild winters and warm, dry summers. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
