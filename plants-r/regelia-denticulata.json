    "intro": "Regelia denticulata, commonly known as the toothed regelia, is a striking plant native to the Andes Mountains of South America. It belongs to the Bromeliaceae family and is characterized by its vibrant, colorful inflorescences that can last for several months. The plant features rosettes of narrow, grass-like leaves that are often covered in a waxy coating, which helps it retain moisture in its native habitat. Its flowers, which come in shades of red, orange, and yellow, are borne on tall, upright stems and attract pollinators such as hummingbirds and bees. Regelia denticulata is a popular choice for indoor gardening due to its ornamental value and relatively low maintenance requirements."
