It belongs to the Rosaceae family and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, white flowers. The plant produces edible berries that are typically red or yellow when ripe, and it thrives in cool, moist environments. It is often found in alpine tundra and boreal forest edges, where it plays a role in local ecosystems. Due to its limited distribution, it is considered a rare and specialized species."
