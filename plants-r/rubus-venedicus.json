    "intro": "Rubus venedicus, commonly known as the Crimean blackberry, is a species of bramble native to the Caucasus and parts of Eastern Europe. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and produces small, dark purple to black berries. The plant has compound leaves with serrated edges and produces white flowers in the spring. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodlands and along stream banks. The berries are edible but have a tart flavor, making them suitable for jams and desserts."
