    "intro": "Rumex mexicanus var. transitorius, commonly known as Mexican sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It features heart-shaped leaves that are typically reddish in color, with a distinctive sour taste due to its high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in clusters during the spring and summer months. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in wetlands, stream banks, and disturbed areas. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for ecological studies and traditional herbal uses."
