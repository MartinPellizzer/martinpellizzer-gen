    "intro": "Rubus acupungens, commonly known as the prickly blackberry, is a species of bramble native to South America. It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that resemble blackberries. The plant produces small, white flowers that bloom in the spring, followed by the development of its edible, dark purple berries. Its leaves are typically trifoliate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in temperate climates with well-drained soil. Rubus acupungens is often found in woodland edges and disturbed areas, where it spreads through its extensive root system."
