It produces small, dark berries that are typically clustered together on the plant. The plant has prickly stems and broad, serrated leaves that are characteristic of many Rubus species. It thrives in well-drained soils and partial shade, making it a suitable candidate for cultivation in temperate climates. The berries are edible and have a tart flavor, often used in local cuisines and traditional herbal remedies."
