    "intro": "Rhynchospora terminalis, commonly known as the narrowleaf beakgrass, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It typically grows in marshes, swamps, and other moist environments, often forming dense stands. The plant has slender, grass-like leaves and produces small, spike-like inflorescences that bear tiny, three-lobed flowers. It is characterized by its narrow, linear leaves and the presence of a terminal spikelet, which gives it its specific epithet. Rhynchospora terminalis plays an important role in wetland ecosystems by providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and birds."
