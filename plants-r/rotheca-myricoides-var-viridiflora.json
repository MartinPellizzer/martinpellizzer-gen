It is a member of the Asteraceae family, characterized by its composite flower heads that resemble small daisies. The plant typically grows in wetland habitats, such as marshes and swamps, where it thrives in moist, acidic soils. Its leaves are narrow and linear, often covered in fine hairs, while the flowers are greenish-white in color, giving it its common name. This species plays a role in supporting local pollinators and is sometimes used in ecological restoration projects."
