    "intro": "Robinia \u00d7 ambigua var. bella-rosea, commonly known as the pink robinia or pink false acacia, is a hybrid deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are pinnately arranged and have a silvery underside, giving it a distinctive appearance. The plant produces showy, fragrant flowers in late spring, typically in shades of pink to white, which are clustered in racemes. It thrives in full sun and well-drained soils, making it adaptable to various garden conditions. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its rapid growth and ability to produce abundant blooms, though it can be somewhat invasive in certain regions."
