    "intro": "Racosperma fleckeri, commonly known as the Flecker's acacia, is a shrub native to the arid regions of Western Australia. It belongs to the Fabaceae family, which is characterized by its nitrogen-fixing ability and pod-bearing fruits. The plant features small, bipinnate leaves and yellow, fluffy flowers that bloom in spring. It is adapted to survive in harsh, dry conditions with deep roots and waxy leaves to reduce water loss. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and threatened species."
