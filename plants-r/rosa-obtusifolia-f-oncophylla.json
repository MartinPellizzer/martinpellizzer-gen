    "intro": "Rosa obtusifolia f. oncophylla, commonly known as the woolly rose, is a compact shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, silvery-gray foliage and small, fragrant pink flowers that bloom in late spring. The plant is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in rocky soils. It is a hybrid form of Rosa obtusifolia, distinguished by its broader, more rounded leaves. This variety is also noted for its resistance to pests and diseases, making it a low-maintenance choice for gardeners."
