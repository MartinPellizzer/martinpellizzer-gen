    "intro": "Rumex paraguayensis, commonly known as Paraguay sorrel, is a perennial herb native to South America. It belongs to the Polygonaceae family and is characterized by its heart-shaped leaves and clusters of small, greenish-white flowers. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are edible and have a tangy, sour taste due to the presence of oxalic acid. It is also used in traditional medicine for its purported health benefits."
