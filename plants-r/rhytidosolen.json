    "intro": "Rhytidosolen, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant belonging to the family Malvaceae. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in a fine, velvety pubescence. The plant produces showy, five-petaled flowers that are typically yellow or orange in color. Rhytidosolen is often found in disturbed habitats such as roadsides and agricultural fields. It is considered an invasive species in some regions due to its rapid growth and ability to outcompete native vegetation."
