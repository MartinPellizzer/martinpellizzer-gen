    "intro": "Rumex dimorphus, commonly known as narrowleaf sorrel, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to North America. It features alternate, lance-shaped leaves that are typically covered in fine hairs, giving them a slightly rough texture. The plant produces small, greenish flowers arranged in clusters, which are borne on slender stems. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread vegetatively, forming dense mats in moist, shaded environments. Rumex dimorphus is often found in wetlands, streambanks, and other damp habitats where it thrives in partial to full shade."
