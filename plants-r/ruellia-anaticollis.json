    "intro": "Ruellia anaticollis, commonly known as the Mexican bluebell, is a flowering plant native to Mexico and parts of Central America. It belongs to the Acanthaceae family and is characterized by its striking blue to violet flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant typically grows as an upright shrub, reaching heights of up to 1.5 meters, with opposite, lance-shaped leaves. Its flowers are clustered in whorls along the stems, and it is often cultivated for its ornamental value in gardens. Ruellia anaticollis is relatively drought-tolerant once established, making it suitable for xeriscaping in arid climates."
