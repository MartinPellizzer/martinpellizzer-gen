    "intro": "Rosa pouzinii var. bilbilitana, commonly known as the Bilbilitan rose, is a rare and endemic species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its compact growth habit, with dense foliage and clusters of fragrant, pinkish-white flowers. The plant typically blooms in late summer, producing small, velvety petals that attract pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are simple, alternate, and covered in fine hairs, while its stems are thornless and covered in a soft, glandular layer. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
