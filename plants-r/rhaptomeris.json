    "intro": "Rhaptomeris, commonly known as the sandverbena, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Verbenaceae. These plants are native to the Americas, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. They typically have small, clustered flowers that range in color from white to purple. Rhaptomeris species are often drought-tolerant, making them well-suited for xerophytic environments. Their leaves are usually narrow and hairy, which helps reduce water loss in dry conditions."
