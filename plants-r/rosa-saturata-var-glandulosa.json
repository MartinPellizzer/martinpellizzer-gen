    "intro": "Rosa saturata var. glandulosa, commonly known as the glandular rose, is a variant of the rose species native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, glandular hairs on the stems and leaves, which give it a distinctive appearance and aid in water retention. The plant produces fragrant, pink to red flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are typically pinnate, with serrated edges, and the plant thrives in well-drained, sandy soils. It is often cultivated for its ornamental value and hardy nature in temperate climates."
