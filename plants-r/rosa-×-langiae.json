    "intro": "Rosa \u00d7 langiae, commonly known as the Langia rose, is a hybrid species resulting from the cross between Rosa rugosa and Rosa chinensis. It is a deciduous shrub characterized by its robust growth and thorny stems. The plant produces fragrant, semi-double to double pink or white flowers in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are dark green, glossy, and serrated, providing a striking contrast to the blooms. Rosa \u00d7 langiae is well-suited for coastal areas due to its salt tolerance and ability to thrive in well-drained soils."
