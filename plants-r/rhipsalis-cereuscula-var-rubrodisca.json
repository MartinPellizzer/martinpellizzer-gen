    "intro": "Rhipsalis cereuscula var. rubrodisca, commonly known as the red-berried mistletoe cactus, is a species of epiphytic cactus native to Brazil. It is characterized by its trailing stems and small, fleshy leaves that are often covered in a white waxy coating. The plant produces small, fragrant white flowers that bloom in late spring, followed by red berries that are edible for birds. Its succulent structure allows it to store water, making it well adapted to humid, shaded environments. This variety is prized for its ornamental value and is often cultivated as a houseplant."
