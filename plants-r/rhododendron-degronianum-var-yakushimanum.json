It features dense, leathery leaves that are dark green and glossy, providing a striking contrast to its showy, bell-shaped flowers. The blooms, which range from pink to white, are typically borne in clusters and are highly fragrant. This variety thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and prefers partial to full shade. It is valued in horticulture for its ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in cooler, moist climates."
