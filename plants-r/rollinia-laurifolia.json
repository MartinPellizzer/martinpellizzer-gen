    "intro": "Rollinia laurifolia, commonly known as the laurel-leafed rollinia, is a tropical evergreen shrub or small tree native to Central and South America. It belongs to the family Myrtaceae, which includes other aromatic plants like eucalyptus and myrtle. The plant is characterized by its dense, glossy, dark green foliage that resembles laurel leaves, hence its common name. Its flowers are small, white or pale yellow, and clustered in terminal panicles, followed by edible, sweet, and fleshy berries. Rollinia laurifolia is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is also used in traditional medicine in some regions."
