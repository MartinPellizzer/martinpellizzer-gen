    "intro": "Rhus henryi, commonly known as Henry's sumac, is a deciduous shrub native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which consist of multiple narrow, elliptical leaflets arranged along a central stem. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by red, fuzzy berries that are a food source for various birds and mammals. It thrives in dry, rocky soils and is often found in desert scrub and woodland habitats. Rhus henryi is valued for its ornamental appeal and its ability to stabilize soil in arid environments."
