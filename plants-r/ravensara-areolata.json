    "intro": "Ravensara areolata, commonly known as the spotted hibiscus, is a flowering plant native to the Pacific Islands. It is characterized by its showy, pink or red bracts that resemble petals, which are actually modified leaves. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom in clusters, attracting pollinators such as bees and birds. Its leaves are oval-shaped with a slightly hairy texture and often have a distinctive spotted or mottled appearance. Ravensara areolata is often cultivated for its ornamental value and is adapted to grow in coastal and tropical environments."
