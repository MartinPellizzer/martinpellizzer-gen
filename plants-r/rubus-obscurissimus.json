    "intro": "Rubus obscurissimus, commonly known as the dark bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to eastern Asia, particularly China, and is characterized by its thorny stems and clusters of small, dark purple berries. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forests and stream banks. Its leaves are ovate with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The berries are edible but are often used in traditional medicine for their purported health benefits."
