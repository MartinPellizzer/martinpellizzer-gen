    "intro": "Ricinus communis subvar. griseus, commonly known as the gray castor oil plant, is a variant of the castor oil plant native to tropical regions. It is characterized by its large, palmate leaves that are often covered with a fine, grayish or whitish pubescence. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds, which are used in traditional medicine and as a source of castor oil. Its growth habit is typically shrub-like, with a branched stem and a preference for well-drained soils. The plant is also valued for its ornamental qualities in gardens due to its striking foliage."
