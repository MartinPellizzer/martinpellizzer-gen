    "intro": "Ranunculus repens var. myrrhiphyllus, commonly known as the myrrh-leaf buttercup, is a low-growing perennial plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It features bright yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in early spring. The leaves are distinctive, being deeply lobed and often covered in a fine layer of soft, white hairs. This variant is characterized by its unique myrrh-scented leaves, which give it its common name. It thrives in moist, shaded environments such as woodland edges and stream banks."
