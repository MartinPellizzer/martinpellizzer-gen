    "intro": "Roegneria festucoides, commonly known as slender wheatgrass, is a perennial grass native to temperate regions of Asia and North America. It typically grows in open, sunny habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and disturbed soils. The plant has narrow, grass-like leaves and produces small, spikelet-based inflorescences. It is characterized by its ability to thrive in poor soils and its resilience to grazing. Roegneria festucoides is often used in ecological restoration projects due to its hardy nature and soil-stabilizing properties."
