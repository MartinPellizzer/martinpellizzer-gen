    "intro": "Rhododendron taxoides, commonly known as the creeping rhododendron, is a flowering plant native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It is characterized by its dense, evergreen foliage and clusters of showy, bell-shaped flowers that bloom in spring. The plant typically grows in shaded, moist environments, often in forest understories. Its botanical features include hairy stems and leathery leaves that help it thrive in cool, humid climates. Rhododendron taxoides is valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
