    "intro": "Rubia acaliculata, commonly known as the slender wood betony, is a perennial herb native to the mountainous regions of southern Europe and western Asia. It is characterized by its upright, slender stems and opposite, lance-shaped leaves that are often hairy. The plant produces small, pinkish-purple flowers arranged in whorled clusters, which bloom in late spring to early summer. Rubia acaliculata is typically found in rocky or gravelly soils and thrives in sunny to partially shaded environments. It is valued for its ornamental appeal and has been used in traditional herbal medicine for its potential medicinal properties."
