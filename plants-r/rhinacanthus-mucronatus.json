    "intro": "Rhinacanthus mucronatus, commonly known as the red sanders, is a tropical tree native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its smooth, reddish bark and elliptical leaves with a slightly serrated margin. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically white or pale pink, followed by woody, spindle-shaped fruits. Its roots are often used in traditional medicine for their purported healing properties. Due to overharvesting, it is now classified as an endangered species."
