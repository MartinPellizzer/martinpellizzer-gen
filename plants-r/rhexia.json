    "intro": "Rhexia, commonly known as flame flower, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Geraniaceae. These plants are native to eastern North America, particularly in moist, woodland habitats. Rhexia species are characterized by their showy, often pink or red flowers that bloom in summer. The leaves are typically heart-shaped and have a smooth or slightly hairy texture. They are valued in gardens for their ornamental appeal and ability to thrive in partial shade."
