    "intro": "Rhododendron subenerve var. nudistylum, commonly known as the naked-stem rhododendron, is a rare and specialized variant of the rhododendron genus. It is characterized by its slender, often glabrous stems and small, leathery leaves that are typically arranged in whorls. The plant produces clusters of bell-shaped flowers, usually in shades of pink or white, which bloom in late spring. It thrives in cool, moist environments with acidic soil, often found in mountainous regions. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a botanical curiosity and a subject of interest for botanists and horticulturists."
