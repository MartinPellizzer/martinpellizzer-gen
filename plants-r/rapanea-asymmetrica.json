    "intro": "Rapanea asymmetrica, commonly known as the asymmetric waxleaf, is a small evergreen shrub native to parts of Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its dense, leathery foliage with a distinctive asymmetrical leaf shape, which gives it its common name. The leaves are typically dark green and have a waxy texture, providing a striking visual contrast to its pale yellow to orange flowers. It produces small, fragrant flowers that bloom in clusters, followed by red, fleshy fruits that are edible for certain bird species. This plant is often cultivated as an ornamental due to its unique appearance and adaptability to various growing conditions."
