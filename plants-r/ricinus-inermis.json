    "intro": "Ricinus inermis, commonly known as the velvetleaf, is a tropical plant native to Africa. It is characterized by its large, heart-shaped leaves that are covered in fine, soft hairs, giving them a velvety texture. The plant produces distinctive spiny capsules that contain toxic seeds. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in disturbed soils or along roadsides. Due to its invasive nature, it can outcompete native vegetation in certain regions."
