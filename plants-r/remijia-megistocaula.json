    "intro": "Remijia megistocaula, commonly known as the giant candleplant, is a unique species of flowering plant native to the Caribbean. It is characterized by its tall, candle-like stems that can reach heights of up to 6 meters. The plant produces small, greenish-white flowers arranged in dense clusters at the top of the stem. Its leaves are long and narrow, often with a waxy coating that helps reduce water loss. Remijia megistocaula is adapted to grow in coastal areas and is often found in sandy soils near the shoreline."
