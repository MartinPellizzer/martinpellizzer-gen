    "intro": "Rubus hirtus var. apricorum, commonly known as the hairy raspberry or apricot raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to parts of Europe and Asia. It is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. The plant typically grows in woodland edges and disturbed soils, preferring partial shade to full sun. Its flowers are white to pink, and the fruits are edible, though often less flavorful than common raspberries. The botanical features of this variant make it a notable species within the Rubus genus."
