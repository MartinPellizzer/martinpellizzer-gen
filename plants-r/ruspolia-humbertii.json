    "intro": "Ruspolia humbertii, commonly known as the Humbert's orchid, is a rare and striking flowering plant native to the high-altitude regions of Central Africa. It belongs to the Orchidaceae family and is characterized by its tall, slender stem and showy, fragrant flowers. The plant typically grows in rocky or forested areas, preferring cool and humid conditions. Its flowers, which can be white, yellow, or orange, bloom in late summer and early autumn. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, Ruspolia humbertii is considered a vulnerable species."
