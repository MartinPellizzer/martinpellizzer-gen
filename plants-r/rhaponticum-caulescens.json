    "intro": "Rhaponticum caulescens, commonly known as the slender rhapontic thistle, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountains of Central Asia. It features a robust, upright stem that is often branched and covered with coarse, grayish-green leaves. The plant produces large, showy yellow flowers that bloom in late summer, attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies. Its leaves are typically lobed and have a rough texture, while the flowers are surrounded by a series of bracts. Rhaponticum caulescens is adapted to harsh, high-altitude environments and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats."
