    "intro": "Rumex pulcher var. woodsii, commonly known as the Woodsii sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the western United States. It features heart-shaped, glossy leaves that are often tinged with red or purple, especially under stress or in full sun. The plant produces small, yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which bloom in early spring. Its rhizomatous growth habit allows it to spread and form dense mats in moist, shady environments. The plant is valued for its ornamental appeal and is sometimes used in native plant gardens."
