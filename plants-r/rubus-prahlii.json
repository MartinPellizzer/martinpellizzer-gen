    "intro": "Rubus prahlii, commonly known as the Prahlii bramble, is a species of flowering plant in the Rosaceae family. It is native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, particularly in countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. The plant is characterized by its thorny stems, trifoliate leaves, and small, aggregate fruits that resemble raspberries. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in rocky or alpine habitats. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and ecologically significant species."
