    "intro": "Rubus schleicheri var. incertus, commonly known as the uncertain bramble, is a variant of the bramble genus Rubus native to Southeast Asia. It is a shrub characterized by its thorny stems and compound leaves with serrated edges. The flowers are typically white or pale pink, and the plant produces small, edible berries that are similar to other Rubus species. It thrives in moist, shaded environments and is often found in forest understories. Due to its limited distribution and taxonomic uncertainty, it is of interest to botanists studying plant classification and biodiversity."
