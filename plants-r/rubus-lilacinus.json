    "intro": "Rubus lilacinus, commonly known as the lilac raspberry, is a species of bramble native to the Pacific Northwest of North America. It is characterized by its trailing growth habit and thorny stems, typical of many Rubus species. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are generally pink to reddish in color, resembling raspberries in appearance. Its leaves are trifoliate, with serrated edges, and it blooms with pale pink to lilac flowers in the spring. Rubus lilacinus is often found in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks."
