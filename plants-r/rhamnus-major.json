    "intro": "Rhamnus major, commonly known as the common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to Europe and parts of Asia. It typically grows to a height of 2\u20134 meters and features dark green, oval-shaped leaves that turn yellow in autumn. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters during late spring, followed by black, egg-shaped berries that are a food source for birds. Its bark is smooth and gray, with prominent lenticels, and it is often found in hedgerows and woodland edges. Rhamnus major is also known for its medicinal properties, particularly in traditional herbal remedies."
