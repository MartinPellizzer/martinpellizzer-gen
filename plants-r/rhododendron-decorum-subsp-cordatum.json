    "intro": "Rhododendron decorum subsp. cordatum, commonly known as the heartleaf rhododendron, is a compact evergreen shrub native to the mountainous regions of eastern Asia. It features lance-shaped, dark green leaves that are often slightly hairy underneath, and it produces clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped flowers in shades of pink to red. The plant thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value lies in its showy blooms and dense, foliage, which provide year-round interest. It is also valued for its ability to attract pollinators and its relatively low maintenance requirements."
