    "intro": "Rosa tomentosa var. dumetorum, commonly known as the woolly rose or the shrub rose, is a perennial shrub native to the mountainous regions of Central Asia. It is characterized by its dense, grayish-white pubescence that covers its stems, leaves, and flowers, giving it a distinctive, fuzzy appearance. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers in shades of pink to red, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. Its leaves are compound, consisting of several oval-shaped leaflets with a soft, hairy texture. This species is valued for its ornamental qualities and is often cultivated in gardens for its aesthetic appeal and hardy nature."
