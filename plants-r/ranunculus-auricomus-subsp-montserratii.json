It is characterized by its bright yellow petals and heart-shaped leaves, which are typical of the Ranunculaceae family. The plant typically grows in rocky or limestone soils, often in coastal areas. It produces small, showy flowers that bloom in spring, attracting various pollinators. Due to its limited distribution and specific habitat requirements, it is considered a rare and endemic species."
