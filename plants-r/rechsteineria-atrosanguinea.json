    "intro": "Rechsteineria atrosanguinea, commonly known as the black blood orchid, is a rare and striking orchid species native to the mountainous regions of South America. It is characterized by its dark red to blackish-purple petals and sepals, which give it its distinctive appearance. The plant typically grows in shaded, humid environments, often in cloud forests or high-altitude grasslands. Its flowers are small but highly ornate, with intricate patterns that aid in pollination by specific insect species. Due to its limited distribution and habitat specificity, it is considered a vulnerable species in its native range."
