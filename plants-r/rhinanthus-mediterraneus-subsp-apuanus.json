    "intro": "Rhinanthus mediterraneus subsp. apuanus, commonly known as the Apuanan yellow rocket, is a flowering plant native to southern Europe. It belongs to the Orobanchaceae family and is characterized by its bright yellow flowers that bloom in late spring to early summer. The plant is hemiparasitic, meaning it partially relies on other plants for water and nutrients through its root system. It thrives in calcareous soils and is often found in open habitats such as grasslands and disturbed areas. Its ornamental value has made it a subject of interest in horticulture and ecological studies."
