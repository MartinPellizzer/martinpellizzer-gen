    "intro": "Rorippa \u00d7 neilreichii, commonly known as the hybrid watercress, is a flowering plant in the Brassicaceae family. It is a naturally occurring hybrid between Rorippa amphibia and Rorippa sardoa, characterized by its aquatic or semi-aquatic growth habit. The plant typically has alternate, ovate to lanceolate leaves that are submerged or floating, with small white flowers that bloom in clusters. It thrives in moist environments such as ponds, ditches, and wetlands, often forming dense mats on the water surface. Its botanical features make it an important species for ecological studies and wetland conservation efforts."
