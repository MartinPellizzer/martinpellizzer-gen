It typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as forest floors and stream banks. The plant features delicate, trifoliate leaves and bright yellow flowers with five petals. It is characterized by its compact stature and is often found in association with other moisture-loving flora. Due to its limited range and habitat specificity, it is considered a rare and endangered species."
