    "intro": "Rumex cyprius, commonly known as Cyprus sorrel, is a perennial herb native to the eastern Mediterranean region. It features heart-shaped leaves that are edible and have a tangy, sour flavor due to their high oxalic acid content. The plant produces small, greenish-yellow flowers arranged in clusters, which are typically pollinated by insects. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland or streamside habitats. Its botanical characteristics make it a valuable plant for both culinary and ecological purposes."
