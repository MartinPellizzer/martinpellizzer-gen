    "intro": "Rhamnus \u00d7 pissjaukovae, commonly known as the hybrid common buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to Europe. It belongs to the family Rhamnaceae and is characterized by its simple, alternate leaves that are typically elliptical or ovate in shape. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue-black berries that are rich in anthocyanins. It thrives in a variety of soil types but prefers moist, well-drained conditions and is often found in woodland edges or disturbed areas. Due to its ornamental value and adaptability, it has been introduced to other regions, sometimes becoming invasive."
