    "intro": "Rorippa indica f. viridiflora, commonly known as the green-flowered watercress, is a variant of the watercress species native to temperate regions. It is characterized by its slender, branched stems and small, alternate leaves that are typically glaucous or hairy. The flowers are distinctive for their bright green coloration, which sets them apart from the typical white or yellow blooms of the species. It thrives in moist environments such as stream banks and wet meadows, often growing in shallow water or damp soil. This plant is valued for its edible leaves and has been used in traditional herbal medicine."
