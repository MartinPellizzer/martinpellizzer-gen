    "intro": "Ratibida columnifera f. denudata, commonly known as the nakedleaf blistercup, is a variant of the columnar blistercup. It is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States, particularly found in arid and semi-arid regions. The plant features a tall, unbranched stem with narrow, grass-like leaves that are often reduced or absent, giving it a distinctive appearance. Its yellow flowers are clustered in a head and are typically visited by various pollinators. The f. denudata form is characterized by its reduced foliage, which sets it apart from the typical form of Ratibida columnifera."
