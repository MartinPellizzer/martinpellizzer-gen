    "intro": "Ranunculus parallelus, commonly known as the parallel-leaved buttercup, is a herbaceous perennial native to the western United States. It features basal leaves that are deeply lobed and arranged in a rosette, with stems that bear alternate, palmately compound leaves. The plant produces showy, yellow flowers with five to nine sepals that resemble petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in meadows and along stream banks. Its botanical characteristics make it a distinctive and ecologically important species in its native habitat."
