It is characterized by its small, oval leaves that are typically gray-green in color and covered in a fine, whitish bloom. The plant produces small, yellowish flowers in clusters, followed by dark blue berries that are edible but have a bitter taste. It thrives in well-drained soils and is adapted to hot, dry climates. This species is often used in landscaping for its drought tolerance and ornamental value."
