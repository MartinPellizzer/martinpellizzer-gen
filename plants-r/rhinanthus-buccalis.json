    "intro": "Rhinanthus buccalis, commonly known as the yellow rattle, is a flowering plant native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is a member of the Orobanchaceae family, known for its parasitic relationship with grasses. The plant produces small, yellow flowers that bloom from June to August, and it is often found in grassland habitats. Its roots form symbiotic relationships with root nodules containing nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Rhinanthus buccalis plays an important role in promoting biodiversity by stimulating the growth of surrounding plants through its parasitic behavior."
