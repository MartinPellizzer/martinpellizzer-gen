It features showy, funnel-shaped flowers that range in color from white to deep pink, blooming in early spring. The plant has leathery, dark green leaves that provide a striking contrast to its vibrant blooms. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soil and partial shade, making it a popular choice for gardens. Its ornamental value is enhanced by its ability to form dense, bushy growth, ideal for hedges or borders."
