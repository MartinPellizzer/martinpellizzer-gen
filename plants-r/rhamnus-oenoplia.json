It typically grows to a height of 1\u20133 meters and features small, oval-shaped leaves with a rough texture. The plant produces yellowish-green flowers in clusters, followed by dark purple berries that are an important food source for birds. Its bark is thick and fissured, and it has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Rhamnus oenoplia is often found in rocky soils and is adapted to dry, sunny environments."
