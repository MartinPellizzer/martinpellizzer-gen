    "intro": "Rubus palaefolius, commonly known as the ancient-leaf raspberry, is a species of bramble native to Europe and parts of Asia. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically arranged in a pinnate pattern with serrated margins. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are often red or yellow in color, similar to other raspberry species. It thrives in temperate climates and is often found in woodland edges and disturbed soils. Due to its historical significance and ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens."
