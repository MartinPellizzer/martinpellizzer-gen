    "intro": "Rhus longifolia, commonly known as the longleaf sumac, is a deciduous shrub or small tree native to the southeastern United States. It is characterized by its compound leaves, which are typically composed of 10 to 30 pairs of oval, serrated leaflets. The plant produces small, yellowish-green flowers in clusters, which are followed by red, fuzzy berries that persist into winter. Rhus longifolia thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in open woodlands and along stream banks. It has historical uses in traditional medicine and is also valued for its ornamental appeal and ecological benefits."
