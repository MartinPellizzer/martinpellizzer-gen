    "intro": "Ranunculus montanus var. villarsii, commonly known as the Alpine buttercup, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to the mountainous regions of Europe. It features showy, yellow flowers with five to eight petals, typically blooming in late spring to early summer. The plant has delicate, trifoliate leaves that are palmately arranged, and it thrives in moist, well-drained soils. It is often found in alpine meadows and rocky slopes, where it contributes to the biodiversity of its habitat. Due to its ornamental value, it is occasionally cultivated in gardens, though it requires specific growing conditions to flourish."
