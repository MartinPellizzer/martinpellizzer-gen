    "intro": "Rondeletia virgata, commonly known as the velvetleaf or Brazilian bellflower, is a flowering plant native to South America. It is characterized by its striking, tubular flowers that range in color from red to orange, often with contrasting yellow or green markings. The plant typically grows as an erect shrub, reaching heights of up to 2 meters, with opposite, ovate leaves that are usually hairy. It thrives in warm, humid climates and is often found in tropical and subtropical regions. The flowers are pollinated primarily by birds, particularly hummingbirds, due to their shape and nectar-rich structure."
