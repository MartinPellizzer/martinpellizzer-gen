    "intro": "Ranunculus micrasterias, commonly known as the small star ranunculus, is a delicate aquatic or semi-aquatic plant native to the northern hemisphere. It typically grows in shallow, still waters such as ponds and lakes, where it thrives in moist, calcareous soils. The plant features small, floating leaves with a waxy coating and bright yellow flowers that bloom in early spring. Its reproductive strategy involves producing numerous small, floating seeds that are dispersed by water currents. The species is notable for its role in aquatic ecosystems, providing habitat and food for various invertebrates and small fish."
