It is characterized by its distinctive morphology, featuring elongated petioles that support its broad, lanceolate leaves. The plant produces small, fragrant flowers that are typically clustered in inflorescences, often displaying a striking coloration. Its botanical significance lies in its potential role in ecological studies and its limited distribution, making it a subject of interest for botanists. Due to habitat loss, it faces conservation challenges, highlighting the need for further research and protection efforts."
