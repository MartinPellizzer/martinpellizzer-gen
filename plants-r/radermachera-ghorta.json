    "intro": "Radermachera ghorta, commonly known as the Japanese evergreen maple, is a tropical plant native to Southeast Asia. It is characterized by its attractive, palmate leaves that resemble those of maple trees, typically with five to seven lobes. The plant produces small, inconspicuous flowers followed by bright red berries that are edible for birds but toxic to humans. It thrives in partial shade and well-draining soil, making it suitable for shaded garden areas or indoor cultivation. Its ornamental value lies in its foliage, which remains vibrant throughout the year."
