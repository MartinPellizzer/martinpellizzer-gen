    "intro": "Rhamnus crocea, commonly known as the yellow buckthorn, is a deciduous shrub native to the western United States. It is characterized by its slender, multi-branched stems and small, yellowish-green leaves that turn reddish in the fall. The plant produces small, greenish flowers in the spring, followed by dark, glossy berries that are an important food source for birds. It thrives in well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and open areas. Rhamnus crocea is also valued for its ornamental appeal and its role in supporting local wildlife."
