It is characterized by its thorny stems and aggregate fruits that mature to a dark purple or black color. The plant typically grows in moist, shaded environments such as woodlands and stream banks. Its leaves are palmately lobed with serrated edges, and the flowers are white with five petals. The fruit is edible, though often described as having a tart and slightly astringent flavor."
