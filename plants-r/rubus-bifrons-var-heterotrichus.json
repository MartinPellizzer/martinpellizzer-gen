    "intro": "Rubus bifrons var. heterotrichus, commonly known as the variable blackberry, is a species of brambles native to the eastern United States. It is characterized by its thorny stems and trifoliate leaves, which are typically dark green and slightly hairy. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that ripen to a dark purple or black color, often with a slight tart flavor. It thrives in moist, well-drained soils and is often found in woodland edges and thickets. Due to its variability in leaf and fruit morphology, it is a subject of taxonomic interest among botanists."
