    "intro": "Ruizia laciniata, commonly known as the laceleaf ruizia, is a tropical evergreen shrub native to the Caribbean and northern South America. It is characterized by its finely dissected, feathery leaves that give it a delicate, lace-like appearance. The plant produces small, inconspicuous greenish-white flowers that are clustered in panicles, typically blooming in the spring. Its growth habit is upright and compact, making it suitable for container gardening or as a focal point in shaded garden settings. Ruizia laciniata prefers moist, well-drained soil and partial to full shade, thriving in humid tropical climates."
