    "intro": "Robiquetia palustris, commonly known as the marsh bellflower, is a perennial herbaceous plant native to wetland habitats in southern Europe. It features slender, upright stems that bear opposite, lance-shaped leaves with hairy surfaces. The plant produces showy, bell-shaped flowers that are typically blue or violet in color, blooming from late spring to early summer. It thrives in moist, nutrient-poor soils and is often found in marshes, fens, and along the edges of ponds. Robiquetia palustris plays an important ecological role by providing nectar for pollinators and stabilizing wetland soils."
