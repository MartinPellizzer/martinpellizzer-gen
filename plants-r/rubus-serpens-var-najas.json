    "intro": "Rubus serpens var. najas, commonly known as the water raspberry, is a variant of the raspberry plant native to wetland habitats in North America. It is a trailing shrub characterized by its slender, woody stems that root at the nodes, forming dense mats along the water's edge. The plant produces small, aggregate fruits that are typically red or yellow, often clustered in groups of three. Its leaves are trifoliate, with three oval-shaped leaflets, and are covered in fine, soft hairs. This species is adapted to moist environments and plays a role in stabilizing shoreline soils."
