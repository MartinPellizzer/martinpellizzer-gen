    "intro": "Rhododendron trichanthum, commonly known as the Florida flame azalea, is a deciduous shrub native to the southeastern United States. It typically grows to a height of 1 to 3 meters and features dense, evergreen foliage that turns yellow in the fall. The plant produces showy clusters of tubular, red-orange flowers in the spring, which are adapted for pollination by hummingbirds. It thrives in acidic, well-drained soils and partial to full shade, making it a popular choice for woodland gardens. Its ornamental value is complemented by its ecological role in supporting local wildlife."
