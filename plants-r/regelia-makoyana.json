    "intro": "Regelia makoyana, commonly known as the golden crown fern, is a striking epiphytic plant native to the tropical regions of South America. It belongs to the family Polypodiaceae and is characterized by its dense, feather-like fronds that form a rosette structure. The plant produces striking yellow spore-bearing structures called sori, which are arranged in a distinctive pattern on the underside of its leaves. Regelia makoyana thrives in humid, shaded environments and requires well-draining, organic-rich soil to flourish. Its ornamental value makes it a popular choice for indoor gardening and tropical plant collections."
